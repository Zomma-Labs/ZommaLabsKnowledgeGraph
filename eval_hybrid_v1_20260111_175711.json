[Source: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity, Date: 2026-01-09]\n- Manufacturing and lending activity **remained largely/stable**, so these sectors did not drive the overall decline.

However, the expected answer also highlights that activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable. The agent mentions retail trade and residential real estate decreased, and that agriculture and resource-related sectors weakened slightly, but does not capture the nuance that these sectors either decreased or remained stable. Instead, the agent adds extra sector details (manufacturing, lending, community support organizations) that are not in the expected answer and may not be fully aligned with it. The core directional change is correct, but the sectoral characterization is only partially aligned with the expected answer, so the overall rating is partially_correct.",
