Instead, on October 2, 2015, Google Inc. underwent a major corporate reorganization under Delaware General Corporation Law, becoming a subsidiary of the newly formed holding company Alphabet Inc. (a C corporation, publicly traded on Nasdaq as GOOGL and GOOG).**\n\nKey details from the records:\n- This involved creating a placeholder subsidiary that merged with Google Inc., converting Google's stock to Alphabet's, without needing shareholder approval.\n- Alphabet Inc. was officially **founded on October 2, 2015**, as documented in its corporate history and filings.\n- Post-reorganization, Google operates as Alphabet's primary subsidiary focused on internet services, led by Sundar Pichai, while Alphabet oversees broader operations (e.g., Waymo, Verily).\n- No records indicate Google or Alphabet ever restructured specifically as an LLC; they remain structured as corporations. A later 2017 step involved forming a holding entity called XXVI to finalize aspects of the 2015 changes.\n\nThis is confirmed by Alphabet's SEC filings, historical chunks (e.g., \"The restructuring process was completed on October 2, 2015\"), and entity relationships like Alphabet **FOUNDED_IN** \"October 2, 2015\" and **ESTABLISHED_SUBSIDIARY** \"Google\".",

      "question": "What is Alphabet's ranking among the world's largest technology companies by revenue?",
      "expected_answer": "Third-largest, after Amazon and Apple",
      "agent_answer": "**Alphabet Inc. (Google's parent company) ranks among the top 5-6 largest technology companies globally by revenue, based on the most recent data (primarily 2024 figures).**\n\nKey details from available entity data:\n- Alphabet reported **$350 billion USD in revenue for 2024**, positioning it behind leaders like **Apple** (~$383B), **Amazon** (~$575B+), **Microsoft** (~$245B, but higher in some metrics), and **Nvidia** (rapidly growing due to AI, exceeding $100B annualized).\n- It is explicitly linked to the **\"Top 50 Global Technology Companies\"** list (published by Forbes), where it \"operates in\" this category alongside peers like Apple and is noted in financial contexts (e.g., REPORTED_FINANCIALS relations include figures like $307B, $325B, and $365B USD from SEC filings and annual reports).\n- Specific revenue mentions in graph relations: $350B (2024), $307B USD, $325.08B USD, $365B USD, confirming its elite status.\n\nExact rankings can shift slightly year-to-year (e.g., #3 or #4 in FY2024 lists from sources like Forbes Global 2000 or Statista), but Alphabet consistently places in the top tier due to its scale in advertising, cloud, and other segments. For the latest precise list, refer to sources like Forbes or annual reports.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "Agent's answer places Alphabet in top 5-6 and mentions it is behind Apple and Amazon (key facts matched), but does not explicitly state it is third-largest, instead hedging with \"top tier\" and noting possible #3 or #4 ranking without confirming third. Revenue figures provided (e.g., Alphabet $350B vs. Apple $383B, Amazon $575B) actually support third place after Amazon and Apple (ahead of Microsoft $245B), but the answer avoids a precise ranking.",

      "agent_answer": "**Mid-2022**\n\nAlphabet Inc. completed a stock split in **mid-2022**, as documented in its company history. This is confirmed by graph evidence from the \"Alphabet > History\" section:\n\n> \"The firm completed a stock split in mid-2022.\"\n\nThis relationship is linked via the \"AUTHORIZED_BUYBACK\" connection between Alphabet Inc. and \"Stock Split,\" with the entity summary for \"Stock Split\" explicitly stating: \"A stock split was completed by Alphabet in mid-2022.\" No more precise date (e.g., exact month or day) is available in the retrieved sources.",

      "question": "What are the main products/services that remain direct components of Google under Alphabet?",
      "expected_answer": "Android operating system, YouTube, and Google Search",
      "agent_answer": "**Google, as the primary subsidiary under Alphabet Inc. (its parent holding company formed in 2015), encompasses most of Alphabet's core revenue-generating products and services.** These are directly operated by Google and form the bulk of its business, distinct from \"Other Bets\" like Waymo, Verily, or Wing.\n\n### Main Products/Services:\n- **Google Search**: The flagship search engine, Alphabet's largest revenue source via advertising.\n- **YouTube**: Video streaming and sharing platform, a major ad revenue driver.\n- **Gmail**: Email service, part of Google's productivity suite.\n- **Google Maps**: Mapping and navigation service.\n- **Android**: Mobile operating system (powers much of Google's ecosystem, including Play Store).\n- **Google Cloud**: Cloud computing and storage services.\n- **Google Play**: App store and digital content distribution.\n- **Google Fiber**: High-speed internet service (in select markets).\n- **Advertising Platforms** (e.g., Google Ads, AdSense): Core monetization across Search, YouTube, and partner sites.\n\nThese drive ~90%+ of Alphabet's revenue (e.g., $350B total in 2024, per reports), with Search and YouTube leading. Data from Alphabet's structure and Google's entity details in the knowledge graph confirm this focus, excluding independent \"moonshot\" subsidiaries. For latest details, check Alphabet's SEC filings (e.g., 10-K reports).",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The agent's answer includes all key facts from the expected answer (Android operating system, YouTube, and Google Search) and provides accurate additional context about Google's core products under Alphabet without contradicting the expected answer. Extra details like revenue sources and structure are consistent and do not detract from the core facts.",
