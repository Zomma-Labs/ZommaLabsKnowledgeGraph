      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says Twelfth District (San Francisco) economic activity edged down slightly, with retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate decreasing or stable. The agent states overall activity edged down slightly and specifically notes retail trade decreased somewhat, residential real estate decreased somewhat, and agricultural activity/conditions weakened slightly. This covers the key facts; extra detail does not contradict the expected answer.",

      "question": "What is the Beige Book?",
      "expected": "The Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication about current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It characterizes regional economic conditions and prospects based on a variety of mostly qualitative information, gathered directly from each District's sources.",
      "answer": "The Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication that describes current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts and characterizes regional economic activity and changes since the previous report. It provides a qualitative summary of current economic conditions, including economic prospects, for each District. [2026-01-09 | About This Publication > What is the Beige Book?]\n\nIts purpose is to characterize the change in economic conditions since the last report and to serve as a regular summary for the public of information on current economic conditions gathered by the Federal Reserve Banks.

      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer defines the Beige Book as a Federal Reserve System publication describing current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts, based on mostly qualitative information gathered from each District\u2019s sources, and characterizing regional conditions and prospects. The agent\u2019s answer matches these key points: it identifies it as a Fed publication covering the 12 Districts, providing a qualitative summary, including prospects, and describes collection via reports/interviews/questionnaires from District sources. Additional details included do not contradict the expected answer.",

      "question": "How did overall economic activity change according to the October 2025 Beige Book?",
      "expected": "Economic activity changed little on balance since the previous report, with three Districts reporting slight to modest growth in activity, five reporting no change, and four noting a slight softening.",
      "answer": "The research findings do not include the October 2025 Beige Book or any description of it. They also state that, as of the time considered in the brief, the October 2025 Beige Book had not yet been published, so its assessment of overall economic activity was not available.\n\nBecause of this, the findings do not specify how overall economic activity changed according to the October 2025 Beige Book, and no description or summary of that change can be provided from the available information.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer states that the October 2025 Beige Book reported little change overall, with specific District counts for growth, no change, and slight softening. The agent instead claims the October 2025 Beige Book was not included/available and provides no summary, which contradicts the expected content and fails to answer the question.",

      "expected": "Three districts reported slight to modest growth: Boston (First District), Philadelphia (Third District), and Richmond (Fifth District).",
      "answer": "The findings state that, in the latest Beige Book, **three Federal Reserve Districts** \u201creported slight to modest growth in activity since the previous report\u201d [National Summary > Overall Economic Activity, 2026-01-09].  \n\nHowever, the available excerpts **do not identify which specific Districts** these are by name (e.g., Boston, Philadelphia, etc.). Therefore, based on the provided findings, we can only say:\n\n- **Number of districts:** 3  \n- **Characterization:** They reported **slight to modest economic growth** in overall activity.  \n- **Limitation:** The specific Districts are **not specified** in the research excerpts provided.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer names the districts: Boston (First), Philadelphia (Third), and Richmond (Fifth). The agent did not provide these districts and instead claimed the excerpts do not specify them. Therefore it fails to answer which districts reported slight to modest growth.",
