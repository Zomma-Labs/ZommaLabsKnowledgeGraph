      "agent_answer": "**XXVI Holdings refers to \"Xxvi Holdings, Inc.\"**, a subsidiary company whose name derives from the Roman numeral XXVI (meaning 26, the number of letters in the alphabet). \n\nIt holds equity in an entity and has the following key relationships:\n- **INVESTED** in: Alphabet, X Development\n- **RELATED_TO**: Alphabet, Roman Numeral 26\n- **HAS_MOTTO**: Roman Numeral For 26\n- **ACQUIRED** by: Alphabet\n\nThis structure appears tied to Alphabet's corporate ecosystem, particularly around its \"X\" (moonshot) projects.",

However, through their super-voting Class B shares (which carry 10 votes per share), they together control over 50% of the company's voting power, giving them significant influence despite their relatively small economic ownership stake.**\n\nThis structure is typical for Alphabet's dual-class share system, where founders retain control.

We like that it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity\u2019s most important inventions.\" It treated Google as one \"bet\" among many, making the broader structure easier to understand.\n- **Symbolic breadth**: Alphabet evokes \"alpha-bet\" (a bet on bold ideas), reflecting the company's diverse \"moonshot\" projects beyond search (e.g., Waymo, Verily).\n- **Practical inspirations**: It allowed cleaner organization of ventures under an \"A to Z\" umbrella (inspired partly by things like the \"Hamburger Abc-Stra\u00dfe\" street name), with Google remaining the core \"G.\"\n\nThis came from Page's August 10, 2015, Google blog post (\"G is for Google\"), echoed in CNBC, The Guardian, and graph-linked sources like \"Collection of Letters\" and Richard Lawler's articles.",
