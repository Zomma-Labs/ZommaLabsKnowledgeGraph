      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "answer": "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\u2019s most recent Summary of Economic Activity (covering the mid\u2011August to September 2025 reporting period), overall economic activity in the Twelfth District (San Francisco) **edged down slightly** relative to the prior reporting period, and **contacts\u2019 economic outlook weakened somewhat** over that time.  \n\nWithin that overall softening:\n\n- **Labor market:** Employment levels were **little changed on net**, with most employers holding headcounts steady, while **wages grew slightly**. Wage pressures persisted in some highly specialized AI technology roles and certain lower\u2011wage construction and manufacturing jobs, but **wage pressures softened across many sectors** such as banking, business consulting, and retail.  \n- **Prices:** **Prices rose modestly** during the period.  \n- **Consumer and business services:** Conditions in **consumer and business services were mixed**.  \n- **Retail and consumer spending:** **Retail trade activity decreased somewhat.**  \n- **Real estate and construction:**  \n  - **Residential real estate activity decreased somewhat.**  \n  - **Commercial real estate activity was unchanged on balance**, with rents described as mixed across subregions of the District.  \n- **Agriculture and resource\u2011related sectors:** **Conditions in agriculture and other resource\u2011related sectors weakened slightly**, continuing weakness from the prior reporting period.  \n- **Community support organizations:** Conditions **weakened modestly**.  \n- **Credit conditions:** **Lending activity remained largely stable** overall.\n\nComparing current conditions with earlier periods, the San Francisco Fed\u2019s report characterizes the District as having **slightly cooled overall activity**, with a **weaker outlook** than the earlier period, **modest price increases**, a **stable but softer labor market** (steady employment, slower wage pressures in many sectors), **stable lending**, and **notable softening in residential real estate, retail trade, and resource\u2011related industries**.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says Twelfth District (San Francisco) economic activity edged down slightly, with retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate decreasing or stable. The agent states overall activity edged down slightly and explicitly notes retail trade decreased, residential real estate decreased, and agriculture/resource-related sectors weakened slightly. This matches the key facts (and adds extra details without contradicting them).",

The New York Fed reported that \u201cconsumer spending in the Second District increased modestly during the reporting period, in part due to the resilience of mid- to upper-income households.\u201d\n\n- **Sectoral/business activity:**\n  - **Manufacturing:** **Manufacturing activity was little changed**, following a summer uptick.

The New York Fed reported that \u201chousing markets in the Second District remained solid during the reporting period.\u201d\n  - **Credit/finance:** **Overall loan demand declined**, and small\u2011 to medium\u2011sized banks reported weaker business loan demand. The New York Fed stated that \u201coverall loan demand in the Second District declined during the reporting period,\u201d and that \u201csmall-to-medium sized banks reported that demand for business loans sagged, contributing to an overall decline in loan demand.\u201d\n\n- **Outlook:** Businesses were **not optimistic about near\u2011term improvement**.
