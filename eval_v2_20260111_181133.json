      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is that four specific districts reported slight softening or decline in economic activity: New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. The agent\u2019s response adds Chicago and treats the set as larger and somewhat ambiguous, claiming the identities of all four softening districts are not fully recoverable. It does not clearly present exactly those four districts as the complete set and instead introduces extra districts and uncertainty. Therefore it fails to match the required specific list and is incorrect.",
