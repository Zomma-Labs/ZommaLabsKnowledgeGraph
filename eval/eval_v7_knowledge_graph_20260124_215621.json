It was **created on October 2, 2015** through a corporate restructuring of Google, after which Alphabet became \u201cthe parent holding company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries.\u201d Alphabet is headquartered at the **Googleplex in Mountain View, California**, and its shares trade on **Nasdaq** under **GOOGL** and **GOOG**. [Source: alphabet, 2024-12-31]\n\nAlphabet\u2019s structure is intended to make Google\u2019s core business \u201ccleaner and more accountable\u201d while giving other, non-internet-focused \u201cgroup companies\u201d more autonomy.

[Source: alphabet, 2024-12-31]",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is that Alphabet Inc. is an American multinational technology conglomerate holding company headquartered in Mountain View, California. The agent\u2019s answer states that Alphabet is an American multinational technology conglomerate and holding company, notes it is the parent of Google and other subsidiaries, and explicitly says it is headquartered at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California. These match all key elements of the expected answer. The additional history, stock details, and subsidiary list are accurate elaborations and do not contradict the expected answer, so the response is correct.",

[Source: alphabet, 2024-12-31]\n\n**Supporting details (founders\u2019 statement):**\n- In Larry Page\u2019s official announcement **\u201cG is for Google\u201d** published on **August 10, 2015**, he explained that reorganizing under Alphabet would increase accountability and transparency for Google\u2019s main business.

Although the agent uses slightly different wording (\u201cmore independently\u201d and mentions management scale) rather than the exact phrase \u201cgreater autonomy to group companies that operate in businesses other than Internet services,\u201d it clearly conveys the same substantive point.
