      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "answer": "Economic activity in the Twelfth District (San Francisco) **edged down slightly** over the most recent Beige Book reporting period, which covered **mid\u2011August to September**. This represents a softening relative to the prior period, and **contacts\u2019 economic outlook also weakened somewhat** over that span.  \n[2026-01-09 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity; National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > San Francisco]\n\nKey associated changes during this period in the Twelfth District were:\n\n- **Employment:**  \n  Employment levels were **little changed on net**.  \n  [2026-01-09 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity; National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > San Francisco]\n\n- **Wages and Prices:**  \n  - **Wages** grew **slightly**.  \n    [2026-01-09 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity; National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > San Francisco]  \n  - **Prices** rose **modestly**.  \n    [2026-01-09 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity; National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > San Francisco]\n\n- **Sector conditions:**  \n  - **Consumer and business services:** Conditions were **mixed**.  \n    [2026-01-09 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity; National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > San Francisco]  \n  - **Resource\u2011related sectors:** Conditions **weakened slightly**.  \n    [2026-01-09 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity]  \n  - **Manufacturing:** Activity remained **largely stable**.  \n    [2026-01-09 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity]\n\n- **Real estate:**  \n  - **Residential real estate:** Activity **decreased somewhat**; Northern California contacts specifically noted **easing residential prices** as conditions weakened.  \n    [2026-01-09 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity; Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Real Estate and Construction; National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > San Francisco]  \n  - **Commercial real estate:** Activity was **unchanged on balance**.  \n    [2026-01-09 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity]\n\n- **Financial conditions:**  \n  - Overall **lending activity remained largely stable**.  \n    [2026-01-09 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity; National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > San Francisco]  \n  - Within the District, **recent reductions in interest rates spurred additional demand for loans**, even as demand for commercial loans remained generally muted.  \n    [2026-01-09 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Financial Institutions]\n\nIn sum, during mid\u2011August to September, the Twelfth District saw a **slight overall decline in economic activity**, characterized by **stable employment**, **slight wage growth**, **modest price increases**, **weaker residential real estate and resource\u2011related sectors**, **mixed services activity**, **unchanged commercial real estate**, and **largely stable lending** with some rate\u2011driven pickup in loan demand.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says economic activity in San Francisco edged down slightly, with retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate decreasing or stable. The agent correctly states that overall activity edged down slightly and mentions residential real estate decreased somewhat, but it does not specifically mention retail trade or agriculture (key expected details). It adds other sectors not asked for, but the main omission makes it only partially correct.",

      "question": "What is the Beige Book?",
      "expected": "The Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication about current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It characterizes regional economic conditions and prospects based on a variety of mostly qualitative information, gathered directly from each District's sources.",
      "answer": "The research findings you provided do not contain any specific information about the Beige Book. They only describe what kind of information *should* be gathered (definition, purpose, content, frequency, etc.), but no actual facts or details about the Beige Book are included.\n\nBecause of this, I cannot, based on the findings alone, state what the Beige Book is, who publishes it, how often it is released, what it contains, or how it is used. The findings simply do not specify any of that.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer defines the Beige Book as a Federal Reserve System publication summarizing current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts using mostly qualitative information from District sources. The agent\u2019s answer does not provide this definition and instead claims it cannot state what the Beige Book is. Therefore it fails to address the question.",

      "question": "How did overall economic activity change according to the October 2025 Beige Book?",
      "expected": "Economic activity changed little on balance since the previous report, with three Districts reporting slight to modest growth in activity, five reporting no change, and four noting a slight softening.",
      "answer": "According to the October 2025 Beige Book\u2019s national summary, overall economic activity showed a mixed and generally moderating pattern:\n\n- **Across districts:**  \n  - Three Federal Reserve Districts reported **slight to modest growth in activity** since the previous report.  \n  - Four Districts reported a **slight softening in activity** over the same period.  \n  - Some areas saw **little change** in overall activity (e.g., the Eleventh District reported that economic activity was \u201clittle changed\u201d over the reporting period; the St. Louis District reported activity was \u201cunchanged\u201d from the previous report; Cleveland contacts described business activity as \u201cflat\u201d).  \n  - Other districts experienced **slight declines**, such as the Ninth District (economic activity \u201cslightly down\u201d) and the Twelfth District (activity \u201cedged down slightly\u201d), and the Tenth District where activity \u201cfell slightly\u201d and had \u201csoftening activity across several sectors.\u201d\n\n- **Character of the change:**  \n  The pattern of \u201cslight to modest growth\u201d in some districts alongside \u201cslight softening\u201d or small declines in others indicates that, compared with the previous Beige Book period, **growth in overall economic activity was generally modest and had softened or edged down in several parts of the country**, rather than accelerating.\n\n- **Outlook component:**  \n  Despite these recent soft or flat readings, **expectations for the future were more positive in some areas**. For example, in the Tenth District, contacts were \u201cbroadly optimistic\u201d about **higher sales and employment in 2026**, and manufacturing contacts there expected **more favorable economic conditions in 2026 than throughout 2025**. At the national-summary level, it was also noted that **many contacts continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down economic activity**, indicating that this optimism was tempered by concern about future risks.\n\nIn sum, the October 2025 Beige Book described **overall economic activity as mixed and generally moderating since the previous report\u2014slight to modest growth in some districts, slight softening or small declines in others, and several districts essentially flat\u2014accompanied by cautious but often optimistic expectations for improvement looking ahead to 2026.**",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is the Beige Book summary: activity changed little on balance, with 3 districts slight/modest growth, 5 no change, and 4 slight softening. The agent correctly states 3 districts had slight/modest growth and 4 had slight softening, and conveys the overall theme of little change/mixed. However, it does not explicitly and correctly report the key fact that five districts reported no change; instead it gives examples of \u201clittle change\u201d without stating the count, and adds extra claims about specific districts and \u201cslight declines\u201d that are not part of the expected summary. Thus it contains some but not all key facts.",

      "question": "Which districts reported slight to modest economic growth?",
      "expected": "Three districts reported slight to modest growth: Boston (First District), Philadelphia (Third District), and Richmond (Fifth District).",
      "answer": "According to the most recent Beige Book national summary, **three** Federal Reserve Districts reported **slight to modest growth** in overall economic activity since the previous report:\n\n1. **Boston (First District)**  \n   - The National Summary notes that in the Boston District, \u201c**economic activity expanded slightly** during the period referenced.\u201d  \n   - This \u201cexpanded slightly\u201d characterization is counted in the National Summary\u2019s statement that **three Districts reported slight to modest growth**.  \n\n2. **Philadelphia (Third District)**  \n   - The National Summary\u2019s district highlights state that **\u201cbusiness activity in the Philadelphia District increased slightly during the current Beige Book period.\u201d**  \n   - The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\u2019s own summary adds that overall economic activity in the Third District **\u201cincreased slightly after rising modestly in the prior period.\u201d**  \n   - These descriptions align with the \u201cslight to modest growth\u201d category referenced in the National Summary.  \n\n3. **Richmond (Fifth District)**  \n   - The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond reports that **\u201cthe Fifth District economy continued to grow modestly in the current cycle.\u201d**  \n   - This \u201cgrow modestly\u201d language is consistent with the National Summary\u2019s count of Districts experiencing \u201cslight to modest growth in activity since the previous report.\u201d  \n\nNo other districts are identified in the findings as having overall economic activity described as \u201cslight\u201d or \u201cmodest\u201d growth; others are reported as flat, unchanged, or slightly declining, or the findings do not specify an overall growth characterization.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer lists Boston (First), Philadelphia (Third), and Richmond (Fifth) as the three districts reporting slight to modest growth. The agent identifies exactly these three districts and no others, matching the expected response.",
