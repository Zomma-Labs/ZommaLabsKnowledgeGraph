      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says Twelfth District (San Francisco) economic activity edged down slightly, and that retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or were stable. The agent explicitly states overall activity edged down slightly and specifies that retail trade decreased, agricultural activity decreased somewhat, and residential real estate decreased somewhat. This matches (and is consistent with) the expected answer, while adding extra detail that does not contradict it.",

      "answer": "The Beige Book is a public Federal Reserve report that describes current economic conditions across the twelve Federal Reserve Districts.

      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The agent accurately identifies the Beige Book as a Federal Reserve report/publication describing current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts and notes it is based on information gathered from district contacts via interviews/reports/questionnaires (i.e., largely qualitative sources).

      "expected": "Economic activity changed little on balance since the previous report, with three Districts reporting slight to modest growth in activity, five reporting no change, and four noting a slight softening.",
      "answer": "According to the October 2025 Beige Book\u2019s national summary, overall economic activity showed a mixed but generally softening pattern across Federal Reserve Districts:\n\n- The \u201cNational Summary > Overall Economic Activity\u201d section reports that **three Districts experienced slight to modest growth in activity since the previous report**, while **four Districts noted a slight softening in activity since the previous report**.  \n- Labor market conditions were an important part of this picture: **demand for labor was generally muted across Districts and sectors in recent weeks** (\u201cNational Summary > Labor Markets\u201d), and **contacts across many industries observed softening labor market conditions** (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Labor Markets).  \n- Sectoral and regional reports highlighted areas of weakness: for example, **activity in energy was generally down among reporting Districts** (\u201cNational Summary > Overall Economic Activity\u201d), and **one contact in the Seventh District (Chicago) described current conditions in the trucking industry as \u201crecession-like\u201d** (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Business Spending).  \n- At the same time, some Districts still reported growth: the **Fifth District (Richmond) reported that its economy continued to grow modestly in the current cycle** (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Summary of Economic Activity), and the **Boston District reported that economic activity ticked up overall in the period covered by the report** (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Summary of Economic Activity).  \n- Despite recent declines in some areas, there were pockets of optimism about the future: in the **Tenth District (Kansas City), economic activity fell slightly**, but **\u201cdespite the recent decline in economic activity, expectations for sales and employment in 2026 were broadly optimistic\u201d** (National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Kansas City; Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Summary of Economic Activity).\n\nTaken together, the October 2025 Beige Book characterized overall economic activity as **mixed, with slight softening in more Districts than those reporting growth, muted labor demand, and notable sectoral weakness, but with some regions still growing modestly and some forward-looking optimism for 2026.**",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says activity changed little on balance, with 3 Districts slight/modest growth, 5 no change, and 4 slight softening. The agent correctly reports the 3 growth and 4 softening counts, but omits the key fact that 5 Districts reported no change and instead characterizes the overall pattern as \u201cgenerally softening,\u201d which diverges from \u201cchanged little on balance.\u201d",

      "question": "Which districts reported slight to modest economic growth?",

The only districts explicitly described as having overall activity change in the relevant direction are:\n\n- **Boston (First District)** \u2013 \u201ceconomic activity expanded slightly\u201d  \n  \u2014 [2026-01-09 | National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Boston]\n\n- **Philadelphia (Third District)** \u2013 \u201coverall economic activity in the Third District increased slightly after rising modestly in the prior period\u201d and \u201cbusiness activity in the Philadelphia District increased slightly\u201d  \n  \u2014 [2026-01-09 | Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia > Summary of Economic Activity]  \n  \u2014 [2026-01-09 | National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Philadelphia]\n\nThus, based on the evidence you provided:\n\n- The Beige Book reports that **three** Federal Reserve Districts, in total, had **slight to modest economic growth** in overall activity.\n- Among the districts named in the excerpts, **Boston** and **Philadelphia** clearly fall into the \u201cslight\u201d (and, in Philadelphia\u2019s case, \u201cpreviously modest\u201d) growth category.\n- The third District with \u201cslight to modest\u201d growth is not identified by name in the supplied findings, so the available evidence does not specify which one it is.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected districts are Boston (First), Philadelphia (Third), and Richmond (Fifth). The agent correctly identifies Boston and Philadelphia as reporting slight growth, but fails to name Richmond and instead claims the third district is not identified.
