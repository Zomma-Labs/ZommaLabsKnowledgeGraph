      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth has two key components: (1) overall economic activity in the Twelfth District edged down slightly, and (2) sector details: retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable. The system answer correctly captures the first component: it states that economic activity in the Twelfth District edged down slightly, matching the direction and characterization. It omits the sector‑specific details entirely but does not contradict them. There are no factual errors, just incompleteness relative to the expected fuller description. That makes it partially correct rather than fully correct.",

Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months.

Many firms said there was little room left to cut other costs.\n\n- **Difficulty passing costs to customers**: Some manufacturers were still absorbing tariff costs (e.g., auto makers) to avoid hurting demand, while others warned they could no longer absorb them as pre-tariff inventories ran out and expected to raise prices going forward.\n\n- **Uncertainty and planning problems**: Ongoing uncertainty about tariff policies made it hard to set pricing, production, capital spending, and advertising plans. Firms were “strategizing” around how to structure prices under changing tariffs.\n\n- **Misapplication and disputes over tariffs**: At least one computer manufacturer reported U.S. customs applying steel and aluminum tariffs to products that did not contain those metals, with challenges taking time to resolve.\n\n- **Weaker demand and lost business**: Some manufacturers linked flat or weaker orders, reduced new business inquiries, and lower overseas demand to tariffs and shifting trade dynamics; in some cases orders were well below expectations.\n\n- **Market and competitive pressures**: Foreign producers sometimes absorbed tariffs and cut prices to keep market share, while some suppliers cited tariffs to justify price increases even when goods were not directly affected. Domestic firms with less foreign import exposure sometimes gained share at the expense of others.\n\n- **Operational and investment constraints**: Higher tariff-related costs led some firms to alter operations (e.g., shipping unfinished goods for final assembly in the U.S.) or adopt stricter criteria for new investments.

Pressures softened in many sectors but remained for specialized AI roles and some lower‑wage construction and manufacturing jobs; health care wages rose due to union contracts.\n- **Atlanta (Sixth District):** Wages grew modestly, generally in the 1–3% range, with wage pressures easing.\n- **Richmond (Fifth District):** Wage growth remained moderate.\n- **Philadelphia (Third District):** Wage inflation continued to ease, but firms still reported modest wage increases, generally in line with long‑run averages.\n- **Cleveland (Fourth District):** Wage pressures were modest; some firms raised wages due to competition, while others held wages steady or tried to limit increases.",

Retailers and restaurants across Cape Cod, coastal New Hampshire, and Maine reported that summer spending totals rose moderately from the previous year owing to an increase in the number of day trips. The number of Canadian travelers to New England remained down sharply from the previous year, and certain parts of Cape Cod and Maine experienced weaker summer tourism activity (from the previous year) as a result. Nonetheless, tourism-related spending increased modestly overall, as domestic and other international travel compensated for the decline in Canadian visitors. Auto sales in New Hampshire increased modestly from last month, driven by the rush to purchase electric vehicles before the expiration of tax credits.

Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

In Chicago, crops were in good shape across most of the District, though soybean prices were lower due to absence of new-crop exports to China. In Atlanta, overall demand for agricultural products was healthy. Minneapolis agricultural contacts were concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases.",
      "system_answer": "Conditions in the agriculture sector were generally weak and under strain:\n\n- **Crops:** Many regions faced poor profitability due to low commodity prices and high input costs. Some areas (e.g., St. Louis District) reported deteriorating conditions, weather-related crop damage, and concerns that many farmers could go bankrupt or exit the industry. Elsewhere (e.g., Dallas, Minneapolis, Chicago), growing conditions and yields were often good, but prices were too low to be profitable in many cases, and uncertainty about trade—especially reduced or eliminated Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans—added pressure.\n\n- **Weather and quality:** Adverse or extreme weather in some districts hurt crop quality (e.g., West Tennessee, parts of the San Francisco District, Chicago’s fruit and vegetable crops). La Niña concerns weighed on the outlook.\n\n- **Costs and credit:** High input costs (including fertilizer, packaging, and financing) and limited remaining room to cut expenses put financial strain on producers. Agricultural credit conditions deteriorated gradually in some areas, and farm incomes and working capital declined in crop-heavy regions.\n\n- **Livestock / protein:** Conditions were notably stronger for livestock and protein producers in several districts. Demand for beef, poultry, and other proteins remained strong, with high cattle and hog prices supporting incomes, though labor shortages constrained expansion in some cases.\n\n- **Overall outlook:** Overall agricultural conditions were described as strained or weakened in multiple districts, with slightly pessimistic or unsettled outlooks, and reliance on government support programs and crop insurance as important safety nets.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the ground truth:\n1) Overall: \"Agriculture conditions were mixed across reporting Districts.\"\n2) St. Louis: conditions \"strained and have further deteriorated.\"\n3) Chicago: \"crops were in good shape across most of the District,\" but soybean prices were lower due to absence of new-crop exports to China.\n4) Atlanta: \"overall demand for agricultural products was healthy.\"\n5) Minneapolis: contacts were concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases.\n\nCompare to system answer:\n- Overall characterization: System says conditions were \"generally weak and under strain\" and later \"overall agricultural conditions were described as strained or weakened.\" This contradicts the ground truth statement that conditions were \"mixed\" (with explicitly healthy demand in Atlanta and good crop conditions in Chicago). So the top-level framing is not just incomplete; it is directionally different.\n- St. Louis: System matches the idea that conditions deteriorated and were strained, including risk of bankruptcy, which is consistent with “strained and have further deteriorated.” This aligns with the ground truth.\n- Chicago: Ground truth says crops in good shape but low soybean prices due to lack of new-crop exports to China. System: says in “Dallas, Minneapolis, Chicago” growing conditions and yields were often good but prices too low to be profitable, and mentions uncertainty about trade, especially reduced or eliminated Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans. This roughly captures that crops were in good shape and soybean prices were low due to China trade issues, though it generalizes more broadly. That’s broadly consistent.\n- Atlanta: Ground truth notes “overall demand for agricultural products was healthy.” System answer never mentions Atlanta or any clearly positive, healthy agriculture demand in that district; instead it emphasizes weakness and strain overall. So this key positive condition is missing and implicitly contradicted by the overall “generally weak” framing.\n- Minneapolis: Ground truth: concern about China’s elimination of soybean purchases. System: explicitly mentions Minneapolis among areas with good yields but low prices, and “uncertainty about trade—especially reduced or eliminated Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans—added pressure.” That aligns with the specific concern.\n\nThe system adds many extra details (weather, livestock, costs, credit). Extra details are fine if consistent. However, the major issue is that the system reframes the sector as “generally weak and under strain” with “overall agricultural conditions…strained or weakened,” which does not reflect the explicitly “mixed” conditions and the healthy demand in Atlanta in the ground truth. This is more than just omission; it gives a different overall picture. Because there is a direct contradiction in the overall characterization (mixed vs generally weak) and omission/implicit negation of Atlanta’s healthy conditions, the answer cannot be considered fully or even just partially correct; it misleads on a key point.\n\nThus the appropriate verdict is INCORRECT.",

This contradicts the ground truth, which explicitly indicates flat, stable, or moderating growth, but not actual decline.\n- It also says \"rather than growing\" as if there were no growth, whereas Kansas City had moderating **growth**, i.e., still growth.\n- So the answer both mischaracterizes the direction (adds decline where there was none) and omits the nuance about moderating but still positive growth.\n\nBecause of these contradictions with the expected description, the answer is not merely incomplete; it is factually wrong on key points.",

(5) St. Louis - contacts reported managing tariffs as a cost factor, while immigration policies resulted in labor shortages with workers in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture not reporting to work due to fears of deportation.

Inventories increased sharply from the previous August, extending a trend that began earlier in the year. According to a Massachusetts contact, buyers became increasingly selective and patient, especially in the condo market. Contacts were hopeful that mortgage rates might fall in the coming months, potentially improving affordability and sales.",

      "system_answer": "Consumer spending patterns varied notably by income group:\n\n- **Higher-income / upper-income households**\n  - Continued to spend on **travel, events, and luxury services** (St. Louis [1]; national summary [11]).\n  - Supported **luxury goods** sales, which “continued to perform well” even as demand for cheaper goods weakened (San Francisco [10]).\n  - Helped drive stronger sales at **higher-end retailers** and **luxury restaurants** (Richmond [6]) and mid‑ to upper‑income–oriented department stores (New York [4], [9]).\n\n- **Middle-income households**\n  - Became **more cautious**, described in one area as experiencing a **“middle-class recession”** (St. Louis [1]).\n  - More often relied on **credit cards and “buy now, pay later”** to maintain spending, with elevated delinquency rates (St. Louis [1]).\n  - Pulled back on **travel and select-service hotels**, as well as some events and family-oriented entertainment (St. Louis [1]).\n\n- **Low- and moderate-income households**\n  - Displayed strong **price sensitivity**, with spending more responsive to **sales, deals, and markdowns** (Kansas City [2]; Minneapolis [5]; national [11]).\n  - Increased use of **food pantries** and struggled more with **basic expenses** (Boston community perspectives [7]; St. Louis [1]).\n  - Showed softer demand at dealerships in low-to-moderate income areas (Chicago [3]).\n\n**Drivers of these differences:**\n\n- **Income and financial stress:** Low- and middle-income households faced greater economic precarity, rising living costs, and higher use of credit and assistance programs, forcing them to cut back or trade down and seek discounts ([1], [7], [11]).\n- **Wealth and buffer capacity:** Mid‑ to upper‑income households had more financial cushion, allowing continued or even strong spending on discretionary and luxury items ([1], [4], [9], [10], [11]).\n- **Price increases and tariffs:** Higher prices, including those linked to tariffs, made lower- and middle-income consumers more cautious and value-focused, while retailers often passed cost increases on more in the mid to high-end markets ([10], [11], [14], [15]).\n- **Credit conditions:** Greater reliance on credit (and delinquency risk) among middle- and lower-income consumers constrained their ability to sustain prior spending levels ([1], [7], [11]).",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Higher‑income individuals maintained strong spending on luxury travel/accommodation.\n2) Lower- and middle-income households sought discounts and promotions and traded down due to higher prices and economic uncertainty.\n3) The bifurcation was driven by rising prices eroding purchasing power for lower/middle-income groups, while higher-income groups were relatively insulated.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer clearly states that higher/upper‑income households continued to spend on travel, events, luxury services, luxury goods, high‑end retailers, and luxury restaurants. This matches and elaborates on “maintained strong spending on luxury travel and accommodation.”\n- For middle-income households, it notes greater caution, a “middle-class recession,” pullbacks on travel/hotels/entertainment, and increased use of credit (BNPL, credit cards) to maintain spending. This is consistent with the idea they are more constrained and not maintaining robust discretionary spending.\n- For low- and moderate‑income households, it explicitly mentions strong price sensitivity and responsiveness to “sales, deals, and markdowns,” as well as struggling with basic expenses and increased use of assistance. That aligns with “sought discounts and promotions due to rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty.”\n- On drivers, the system answer highlights: (a) income and financial stress, rising living costs, and economic precarity for low/mid-income groups; (b) greater “wealth and buffer capacity” for higher‑income households, allowing continued discretionary/luxury spending; (c) price increases and tariffs making low/mid-income more cautious and value-focused; and (d) credit conditions constraining lower/middle incomes. These together capture the expected mechanism: rising prices eroding purchasing power of low/mid-income groups vs relative insulation of higher incomes.\n- There is no contradiction with the expected answer; the system answer is more detailed but fully contains the key ideas and relationships requested.\n\nTherefore the answer is fully consistent and complete relative to the ground truth.",

This matches the ground truth, capturing both the reduction in benefits and financial distress among Medicaid patients, and is consistent (just adds detail about uncompensated needs).\n2) Cleveland: System says nonprofits were not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants, and adds that some drew on reserves. This matches the key fact (not filling positions due to grant uncertainty) and adds non-contradictory detail.\n3) Boston: System says contacts highlighted planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid as a risk that would increase precarity and pressure nonprofits serving low- and moderate-income households. The ground truth, however, specifies that cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health-care sectors. The system does not mention layoffs, education, or health-care sectors, and instead frames Boston as facing prospective risk and pressure on nonprofits, which is a different effect than the documented layoffs due to grant cuts. While this is not an explicit contradiction, it omits the core described impact (layoffs in education and health care) and substitutes a different one (future risk/pressure on nonprofits in general). Because the Boston portion of the expected answer is not captured, the answer is incomplete, though not factually contradictory relative to what’s given.\n\nGiven that New York and Cleveland are handled correctly but the specific Boston impact is missing/changed, the overall answer is partially correct, not fully correct or incorrect.",

      "question": "Which specific sectors reported labor shortages due to immigration policies, and in which districts was this most prominently mentioned?",
      "expected_answer": "Four sectors reported labor shortages due to immigration policy changes: hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing. The St. Louis District explicitly stated that contacts continue to report immigration policies resulting in labor shortages. The Boston District noted retail and tourism contacts worried about next summer's labor supply given expected reductions in seasonal visas, with Maine and Vermont seeing increased labor market slack.",
      "system_answer": "Answer:  \n\nThe sectors that reported labor shortages due to immigration policies were:\n\n- **Agriculture** – noted in the Atlanta District ([2]), the San Francisco District ([5]), and the national summary ([3]); also cited in the St. Louis District ([9], [12], [13]).  \n- **Hospitality / Leisure and Hospitality** – mentioned in the Atlanta District ([2]) and the New York District ([4]), and in the national summary ([3]).  \n- **Construction** – reported in the Philadelphia District ([1]), the New York District ([4]), the San Francisco District ([10]), and the St. Louis District ([9]); also included in the national summary ([3]).  \n- **Manufacturing** – cited in the national summary ([3]), and specifically in the St. Louis ([9]) and Chicago ([11]) Districts.  \n\nThis issue was most prominently mentioned in the **St. Louis District**, where multiple reports ([9], [12], [13]) explicitly tied labor shortages in **manufacturing, construction, and agriculture** to immigration policies and fears of deportation.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the ground truth:\n1) Four sectors are involved: hospitality, agriculture, construction, manufacturing.\n2) St. Louis District explicitly stated contacts continue to report immigration policies resulting in labor shortages.\n3) Boston District noted retail and tourism contacts worried about next summer’s labor supply given expected reductions in seasonal visas, with Maine and Vermont seeing increased labor market slack.\n\nCheck against system answer:\n- Sectors: The system lists agriculture, hospitality, construction, and manufacturing as sectors affected by immigration‑related labor shortages. This matches the four sectors in the expected answer.\n- St. Louis: The system correctly highlights St. Louis as the district where this was most prominently mentioned and says multiple reports explicitly tied labor shortages in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture to immigration policies and fears of deportation. This is consistent with the expected answer’s emphasis on St. Louis and immigration‑policy‑driven shortages.\n- Boston: The expected answer specifically wants mention that Boston District noted retail and tourism (hospitality-related) contacts worried about seasonal visas and that Maine and Vermont saw more slack. The system answer does not mention the Boston District at all, nor retail/tourism there, nor Maine/Vermont. That is a clear omission of a key part of the expected answer.\n- Contradictions: The system doesn’t contradict the ground truth; it just adds some extra district references (Atlanta, San Francisco, New York, etc.) but those are not flagged as wrong by the task, and nothing directly conflicts with the ground truth description. The main issue is incompleteness (no Boston mention), not incorrectness.\n\nTherefore the system answer is accurate for what it states, but it omits a key district (Boston) and associated detail that the question explicitly asks for. That fits “PARTIALLY_CORRECT.”",

Immigration policy changes created labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston). The potential for government shutdown was highlighted as a downside risk. Kansas City noted that despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic.",
      "system_answer": "Several distinct factors contributed to economic uncertainty across different districts:\n\n1. **Tariffs and Trade-Policy Uncertainty**\n   - Higher tariffs and “waning overall demand” weighed on manufacturing activity nationally [1], with specific mentions in:\n     - Cleveland: Manufacturers cited tariffs and trade-policy uncertainty as driving modest demand declines [3].\n     - Philadelphia: Firms reported higher cost pressures from tariffs and expected to raise prices [6].\n     - Richmond: Manufacturers cited tariffs as a source of increased price growth [12].\n\n2. **Domestic Policy / Government Risks**\n   - Nationally, one District highlighted “downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown” [1].\n   - Philadelphia contacts across industries also warned about “additional downside risks of a prolonged government shutdown” [6].\n   - Dallas contacts cited “domestic policy uncertainty” as a primary concern going forward [7].\n\n3. **Inflation and Cost Pressures**\n   - Nationally, rising prices were noted, with lower- and middle-income households seeking discounts amid “elevated economic uncertainty” [1].\n   - New York reported strongly rising input prices and elevated overall price increases [11].\n   - Dallas contacts cited inflation as a key concern [7].\n   - Labor cost pressures intensified due to higher employer health insurance expenses [13].\n   - Boston and other districts noted tariff-related and other cost pressures on prices [8], [15].\n\n4. **Weak or Shifting Demand**\n   - National summary noted waning overall demand in manufacturing [1] and softening activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation [1].\n   - Dallas: Outlooks worsened with “weakening demand” [7].\n   - Kansas City: Sectoral shifts driven by technology, policy shocks, and changing consumer preferences led to mixed and uncertain conditions [5].\n   - Richmond: Customer uncertainty and price sensitivity led manufacturers to adjust product offerings [12].\n\n5. **Income and Household Security Concerns**\n   - Boston: Community contacts reported greater precarity among low- and moderate-income households (increased food pantry use, difficulties paying bills) and saw risks from planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid and tariff-linked price increases [2].\n   - Boston non-business contacts expressed growing concerns about lower-income households’ economic security [8].\n\n6. **Agricultural Sector Uncertainty**\n   - Chicago agriculture: Elevated uncertainty unsettled operators; soybean prices were lower due in part to lack of exports to China; concerns about higher future input costs (rising fertilizer prices) and unclear economic outlook dampened capital investment [14].\n   - Minneapolis: Agricultural contacts were concerned about China’s elimination of soybean purchases [9].\n\n7. **Labor Market and Technology-Related Uncertainty**\n   - National labor summary: Employers cited “elevated economic uncertainty” and, in some cases, increased investment in AI as reasons for layoffs and reduced head counts [13].\n\n8. **International Factors**\n   - Nationally: Demand for leisure and hospitality from international travelers fell further [1], adding to uncertainty in those service sectors.\n\nThese factors, varying in prominence by district, collectively contributed to elevated uncertainty about current conditions and future growth.",

      "judge_reasoning": "Key expected factors:\n1) Tariff policy changes made planning difficult for manufacturers (Chicago and across districts).\n2) Federal grant uncertainty affected nonprofits (Cleveland, New York, Boston).\n3) Policy uncertainty as a top business concern (Dallas).\n4) Immigration policy changes creating labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston).\n5) Potential for government shutdown as a downside risk.\n6) Kansas City: despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic.\n\nCheck system answer:\n- It does discuss tariffs/trade-policy uncertainty, but locates them mainly in Cleveland, Philadelphia, Richmond, not Chicago. Still, tariffs as a factor are captured, albeit with different districts.\n- It includes domestic policy/government risks and explicitly mentions “downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown” and firms warning about that. This matches the shutdown factor.\n- It correctly notes Dallas contacts citing “domestic policy uncertainty” as a primary concern—this aligns with policy uncertainty in Dallas.\n- It does not mention federal grant uncertainty affecting nonprofits in Cleveland, New York, or Boston.\n- It does not mention immigration policy changes or related labor supply concerns in St. Louis or Boston.\n- It adds many other sources of uncertainty (inflation, demand weakness, agricultural uncertainty, labor/AI, international tourism) that are not in the expected answer, but they are not contradictions; they’re extra context.\n- Kansas City is mentioned, but in a different way: sectoral shifts and mixed conditions; it does not include the point that expectations for 2026 remained optimistic despite current decline.\n- There are no direct contradictions with the ground truth items; the system answer is broader and somewhat misaligned on which districts emphasized tariffs, but that isn’t a direct contradiction of the expected facts.\n\nOverall, the answer captures some key factors (tariffs/trade uncertainty, policy uncertainty in Dallas, government-shutdown risk) but omits others (federal grant uncertainty, immigration policy effects, optimistic 2026 expectations). The present facts appear plausible and not contradictory, but the coverage of the specific factors requested is incomplete.\n\nTherefore the best label is PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

In New York, rising business costs including insurance added to financial pressures for community service providers. Employer-sponsored health insurance expenses saw outsized increases, intensifying labor cost pressures across districts. These service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.",

These higher service costs squeezed margins and contributed to expectations of future selling price increases.\n\n- **Restaurants and hospitality:**  \n  Faced rising liability insurance and other operating costs, but often kept menu and room prices mostly unchanged due to customer resistance, leading to reduced profitability. Some restaurants responded by shrinking portions or altering recipes.\n\n- **General business contacts across districts:**  \n  Many reported cost pressures from insurance, health care, and utilities, with some firms unable to fully pass these costs through, instead using discounts or keeping prices steady to maintain demand.",

This matches items (1) from the ground truth.\n- It adds “utilities” as a cost pressure. The ground truth doesn’t mention utilities; this is an addition but not a direct contradiction.\n- On sectoral effects, the system describes impacts on service-sector firms, restaurants/hospitality, and general business contacts. However, it does not mention the specific New York context or community service providers’ financial pressures, which is a key detail in the expected answer (point 2).\n- It also does not mention that employer-sponsored health insurance expenses saw “outsized” increases across districts, nor does it clearly frame health insurance as a particularly strong/intensifying labor cost pressure across districts (point 3). It only generally notes that premiums were rising faster than revenues.\n- It omits entirely the note that these service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases (point 4).\n\nThere are no clear factual contradictions; the answer is broadly consistent with the expected one but misses several specific key points (New York/community service providers, outsized increases across districts, and the linkage to tariff-driven goods costs). Therefore, it is accurate but incomplete, which fits PARTIALLY_CORRECT rather than fully CORRECT.\n",

      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Retail categories with gains in Chicago: \n   - Restaurants in fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments\n   - New light vehicle sales were brisk, especially around the end of EV tax incentives\n2) Categories with softness/declines in Chicago:\n   - Travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels\n   - Used vehicle sales overall steady but softer demand in low‑to‑moderate income communities\n3) Behavioral interpretation:\n   - Consumers are seeking value in dining\n   - Consumers are cutting back on travel\n\nComparison with the system answer:\n- Gains:\n  • The system explicitly mentions **fast food, fast casual, and family dining restaurants** in Chicago as categories with gains – this matches the expected answer.\n  • It also notes **new light vehicles, especially EVs before tax credit expiration**, as a gain category and correctly ties this to tax credit timing – also aligned with the expected answer.\n- Declines/softness:\n  • The system lists **travel, hospitality, and tourism** as a declining category and explicitly includes Chicago in the list of districts. That correctly reflects softness in travel-related categories (airlines and hotels) from the expected answer, though it’s embedded in a broader multi‑district discussion.\n  • For autos, the system says **autos in many districts, especially SUVs and EVs post‑incentive; shift toward family sedans and used vehicles**. This does not contradict the ground truth (which says used vehicle sales remained steady overall but were softer in low‑ to moderate‑income communities). The system’s statement is broader and multi‑district, but not in direct conflict with Chicago’s described pattern.\n- Behavioral patterns:\n  • The system’s behavior interpretation emphasizes **heightened price sensitivity and value shopping**, **trading down (e.g., from full‑service to quick service restaurants)**, and **incentive‑driven purchases (EVs before tax credit expiration)**. These themes are consistent with “consumers seeking value in dining” and “pulling forward vehicle purchases due to incentives.”\n  • It also notes **reduced or more cautious travel**, which is consistent with “cutting back on travel.”\n\nThe system answer adds a lot of extra, cross‑district detail beyond what the expected answer requires, but that is allowed. Crucially, it includes all key Chicago facts (restaurant gains, new light vehicle gains related to incentives, softness in travel) and a behavior interpretation that is consistent with seeking value in dining and cutting back on travel. It does not contradict any of the expected points; it simply goes further and more broadly. Therefore the answer should be judged CORRECT, not just partial.",

In Chicago, business loan demand decreased slightly on net with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity, while consumer loan demand increased slightly with a pickup in mortgage refinancing. In Dallas, loan demand grew overall. St. Louis reported banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions. Consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.",
      "system_answer": "Banking conditions showed clearer signs of strain in consumer lending than in business lending, though patterns varied by district:\n\n- **Kansas City:** Loan demand and standards were steady overall, but moderate deterioration was specific to **consumer lending portfolios**, with expectations of further consumer stress as disposable incomes fall. No comparable deterioration was highlighted for business loans.\n\n- **St. Louis:** **Commercial loan demand was strong** (especially in Memphis), though small business credit demand was temporarily depressed but rebuilding. In contrast, **consumer delinquency rates were steadily increasing**, with more borrowers seeking credit counseling, and banks were tightening standards (including more scrutiny of small business loans).\n\n- **New York:** Demand for **business loans sagged**, driving an overall decline in loan demand, and **delinquency rates worsened especially for business loans**, while consumer loan demand was steady and residential mortgage demand grew moderately.\n\n- **Philadelphia:** **Business lending (commercial & industrial, commercial real estate) declined**, while several categories of **consumer lending rose strongly or at least modestly** (non-auto/non-card consumer loans up strongly; HELOCs, autos, mortgages up; credit cards down modestly).\n\n- **Chicago:** **Business loan demand decreased slightly** and business loan quality declined modestly, with tighter terms. **Consumer loan demand increased slightly**, loan quality was flat, and terms tightened only slightly.\n\n- **Atlanta:** Loan demand was muted for both sectors, but **overall consumer lending contracted further**, even as credit quality remained generally healthy; corporate loan demand was also weak but without specific mention of deterioration.\n\n- **Dallas:** Credit standards and terms **eased somewhat for residential real estate (consumer)** but **tightened for other loan types**, mainly affecting business and non‑residential credit. Overall loan performance deteriorated slightly, though commercial real estate performance improved.\n\n- **San Francisco:** **Commercial loan demand was muted overall**, with pockets of strength (e.g., semiconductor projects). Lending activity was stable, and credit quality remained generally high with no specific consumer-versus-business split in deterioration.\n\n- **Richmond:** Loan demand was broadly stable, with **some modest increase in commercial loan demand**. A **modest rise in delinquencies was concentrated in consumer portfolios** (including mortgages and HELOCs), not business loans.\n\n- **Cleveland:** Both **household and business loan demand increased moderately**, encouraged by lower rates, with flat delinquency rates—no notable divergence between consumer and business credit quality.\n\nAcross districts, a common pattern was:\n- **Consumer side:** More frequent reports of rising delinquencies or portfolio deterioration (Kansas City, St. Louis, Richmond, Atlanta), though in some districts consumer loan demand was rising (Philadelphia, Chicago).\n- **Business side:** Often softer or muted business loan demand (New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, San Francisco), but with generally strong or stable credit quality except where noted (e.g., modest deterioration in business loans in New York and Chicago).",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key expected points:\n1) Kansas City: consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately, signaling household stress; expectations for 2026 optimistic.\n2) Chicago: business loan demand decreased slightly on net (with decline in acquisition activity); consumer loan demand increased slightly with pickup in mortgage refinancing.\n3) Dallas: loan demand grew overall.\n4) St. Louis: banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions; consumer lending showed some signs of stress; business lending conditions were mixed.\n5) Overall contrast: consumer vs business lending per those districts.\n\nComparison:\n- Kansas City: System correctly notes \"moderate deterioration...specific to consumer lending portfolios\" and no comparable deterioration for business loans. It does not mention 2026 optimism but that is a minor omission; no contradiction.\n- Chicago: System says business loan demand decreased slightly and consumer loan demand increased slightly, matching the directionality. However, it omits the detail about decline in acquisition activity and pickup in mortgage refinancing. That is incompleteness but not contradiction.\n- Dallas: Ground truth says loan demand grew overall. System instead emphasizes that standards eased for residential real estate but tightened for other loan types, and \"overall loan performance deteriorated slightly\"; it does **not** say that loan demand grew overall and instead implies a more mixed/negative performance picture. This conflicts with the expected simple characterization that loan demand grew overall.\n- St. Louis: Ground truth: activity unchanged, strong overall credit conditions, consumer lending some stress, business mixed. System: says commercial loan demand was strong (esp. Memphis), small business credit demand depressed but rebuilding, consumer delinquency rates steadily increasing and more credit counseling, banks tightening standards. This contradicts “banking activity unchanged” and “strong overall credit conditions”; it paints a meaningfully different picture of both activity and conditions.\n- The system also adds many other districts (New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Francisco, Richmond, Cleveland) that are not in the expected answer. Extra detail would be fine if not contradictory, but the core comparisons required (Dallas, St. Louis) are not aligned with the expected summary.\n\nBecause of these contradictions on key districts, the answer is not just partially incomplete; it is factually inconsistent with the expected answer on central points (Dallas demand, St. Louis conditions).",

However, construction employment also faced headwinds in certain parts of the District. Most contacts indicated any impending layoffs will be modest and meant to right-size staffing levels with slightly softer demand conditions to maintain profitability. However, some professional service companies indicated larger layoffs that occurred recently were associated with the adoption and implementation of Al capabilities that reduced overall labor needs. Waning growth in labor demand and the availability of former federal workers in many local markets kept wage growth subdued. Despite the recent softening in labor demand, the majority of businesses across all sectors indicated they expect their head count to be greater at the end of next year compared to their current level.",

Consumer spending increased modestly (better than national 'inched down'). Manufacturing demand declined modestly (consistent with national challenging conditions). Employment was flat (matching national stable levels). Wages and benefits costs were up modestly (matching national modest-to-moderate). Prices rose moderately (matching national rising trend). Financial conditions loosened slightly (better than mixed national picture). Construction/real estate increased slightly (better than mixed national). Farm income prospects unchanged. Compared to national trends, Chicago showed relative strength in financial conditions, construction, and consumer spending while manufacturing weakness aligned with broader trends.",
      "system_answer": "The key economic indicators for the Chicago (Seventh) District in the provided context were:\n\n- **Overall economic activity:** Flat / little changed.  \n- **Consumer spending:** Increased modestly.  \n- **Construction and real estate activity:** Increased slightly.  \n- **Employment:** Flat.  \n- **Nonbusiness (nonprofit/community) activity:** No change.  \n- **Business spending (capital and other):** Declined slightly.  \n- **Manufacturing activity:** Declined modestly.  \n- **Prices:** Rose moderately.  \n- **Wages:** Up modestly.  \n- **Financial conditions:** Loosened slightly.  \n- **Farm income outlook (for 2025):** Prospects unchanged.\n\n**Comparison to national trends (from the National Summary):**\n\n- Nationally, **overall activity** was also roughly flat on balance (mix of slight growth, no change, and slight softening across Districts), consistent with the Seventh District’s flat activity.\n- National **consumer spending** overall “inched down,” whereas in the Seventh District it **increased modestly** (stronger than the national pattern).\n- National **manufacturing** was described as facing “challenging conditions” with waning demand; in the Seventh District it **declined modestly**, which is in line with that weakness.\n- National **agriculture, energy, and transportation** activity was “generally down,” while in the Seventh District **farm income prospects were unchanged**, implying slightly better relative stability in agriculture than the national downtrend.\n- National conditions in **financial services and real estate** were mixed; in the Seventh District **financial conditions loosened slightly** and **construction/real estate increased slightly**, suggesting somewhat more favorable financial and property-market conditions than the national mixed picture.\n- Nationally, prices were rising and uncertainty was elevated; in the Seventh District **prices rose moderately** and **wages increased modestly**, which is broadly consistent with the national characterization of ongoing price and wage increases.",

      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements in the expected answer:\n- Economic activity: little changed, matching national ‘little change on balance’.\n- Consumer spending: increased modestly, stronger than national ‘inched down’.\n- Manufacturing: demand declined modestly, in line with national ‘challenging conditions’.\n- Employment: flat, matching national stable levels.\n- Wages/benefits: up modestly, matching national modest-to-moderate.\n- Prices: rose moderately, matching national rising trend.\n- Financial conditions: loosened slightly, stronger than mixed national picture.\n- Construction/real estate: increased slightly, stronger than mixed national picture.\n- Farm income prospects: unchanged.\n- Overall comparison: Chicago relatively stronger in financial conditions, construction, consumer spending; manufacturing weakness aligned with national trends.\n\nNow compare with the system answer:\n- It lists: overall activity flat/little changed; consumer spending up modestly; construction/real estate up slightly; employment flat; manufacturing declined modestly; prices rose moderately; wages up modestly; financial conditions loosened slightly; farm income prospects unchanged. All these district indicators match the ground truth, with no contradictions.\n- It adds business spending declined slightly and nonbusiness activity no change—these are extra details, not in conflict with the expected answer.\n- Comparison to national trends: correctly notes overall activity roughly flat; national consumer spending inched down vs Chicago up modestly (stronger); national manufacturing ‘challenging’ vs modest decline (aligned); national ag/energy/transport generally down vs farm prospects unchanged (implies relatively stronger, consistent with expected characterization of unchanged vs national down); national financial/real estate mixed vs Chicago slightly stronger; national rising prices and ongoing wage increases vs Chicago moderate price and modest wage rises. This is fully consistent with the expected comparison.\n- The expected answer’s summary (Chicago relative strength in financial conditions, construction, consumer spending; manufacturing aligned with broader weakness) is explicitly captured in the system’s narrative.\n\nThere are no factual contradictions and all key facts are present, with some additional correct detail. Hence the answer is fully correct.",

Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong.
