      "judge_reasoning": "The expected answer states that economic activity in San Francisco edged down slightly and also specifies that activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable. The system answer correctly captures that economic activity in the Twelfth District (San Francisco) edged down slightly, but it omits the sector-specific details about retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate. There are no factual errors in what is provided; it is simply incomplete relative to the expected answer. Thus it is partially correct, not fully correct.",

Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

Overall consumer spending, particularly on retail goods, inched down in recent weeks, although auto sales were boosted in some Districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September. Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

Despite some softening in used car sales and concerns about affordability, dealers were optimistic in the face of solid demand and healthy inventory levels.",

Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months.

Restaurants in the luxury and quick service categories also reported solid revenue growth. In contrast, casual sit-down restaurants reported a softening in sales. A retailer in North Carolina noted that customers were clearly looking for value and comparative price shopping in their stores. Companies tied to new home construction reported soft activity, however a replacement window company reported strong sales, which was attributed to homeowners opting to renovate rather than sell their homes. A furniture store saw less traffic and fewer sales and was concerned that recently announced tariffs would further reduce demand in the near future. Reports from tourism and travel businesses were mixed. Hotels in some parts of the Fifth District saw increased occupancy and revenues and attributed the growth to leisure and sports-related travel. Several hotels in the greater Washington, D.C. area, on the other hand, reported lower occupancy rates as business travel for conferences and worker trainings declined.",

The majority of contacts reported they expect sales in 2026 to outperform this year, despite the recent softness in demand and lower expected spending for the remainder of 2025.",

Retailers and restaurants across Cape Cod, coastal New Hampshire, and Maine reported that summer spending totals rose moderately from the previous year owing to an increase in the number of day trips. The number of Canadian travelers to New England remained down sharply from the previous year, and certain parts of Cape Cod and Maine experienced weaker summer tourism activity (from the previous year) as a result. Nonetheless, tourism-related spending increased modestly overall, as domestic and other international travel compensated for the decline in Canadian visitors.

Hotel occupancy rates for greater Boston and Cape Cod increased slightly in August from a year earlier. Retailers and restaurants across Cape Cod, coastal New Hampshire, and Maine reported that summer spending totals rose moderately from the previous year owing to an increase in the number of day trips. The number of Canadian travelers to New England remained down sharply from the previous year, and certain parts of Cape Cod and Maine experienced weaker summer tourism activity (from the previous year) as a result. Nonetheless, tourism-related spending increased modestly overall, as domestic and other international travel compensated for the decline in Canadian visitors. Auto sales in New Hampshire increased modestly from last month, driven by the rush to purchase electric vehicles before the expiration of tax credits. The outlook shifted from pessimistic to neutral among retail and tourism contacts, although contacts said that considerable uncertainty remained.",

Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months.

      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "The expected answer identifies a single key challenge: changing tariff policies made it difficult for manufacturers to plan for the future. The system answer includes a bullet explicitly stating “uncertainty about trade policy and pricing … made planning difficult,” which matches this core idea. However, the rest of the system answer adds numerous specific challenges—higher input costs, difficulty passing costs on, eroded demand, operational adjustments, misapplication of tariffs—that are not mentioned in the ground truth. These additional details are not contradicted by the expected answer, but they are not supported or required by it either and go significantly beyond the simple point in the ground truth. There is no clear factual contradiction with the expected answer, and the key fact (planning difficulty due to tariff uncertainty) is present. Thus the answer is not wrong, but it is more expansive than the expected answer. That fits best with “partially correct”: it contains the required fact plus extra, not-validated material, but nothing clearly incorrect relative to the given ground truth.",

Some auto manufacturers reported feeling the pinch from tariffs on new car sales but were absorbing these increases to prevent further declines in demand. Some firms, however, reported little to no tariff impacts thus far. A few service-oriented firms noted an ability to increase prices without pushback from customers. Steel prices flattened amid slower demand, but some producers held prices steady to preserve strong margins.

It talks about softer demand, holding headcount flat, sector-specific patterns, AI substitution, and retention, but not about labor being more available or easier to find.\n- Much of the additional detail goes beyond the ground truth and is not supported by the expected answer (e.g., AI reducing entry-level roles, sector-specific trends). There is no direct contradiction with the ground truth, but key element (improved labor availability) is missing, so the answer is incomplete.\n\nGiven that one of the two core points is captured correctly and no explicit factual contradiction with the ground truth is visible (we only judge against the expected answer, not external reality), the answer is partially correct rather than fully correct or incorrect.",

Summary reports also label wage growth as moderate [8][20].  \n- **New York (Second District):** Wages grew modestly overall; some sectors (construction, leisure and hospitality, wholesale, education) saw strong wage growth, while finance saw only slight wage increases. Contacts expected wage growth to accelerate [3].  \n- **Atlanta (Sixth District):** Wages grew modestly; specifically in the 1–3% range, with easing wage pressures [4][10][18].  \n- **Richmond (Fifth District):** Wage growth remained moderate across the District, even as employment was flat on balance [5][7].  \n- **San Francisco (Twelfth District):** Wages grew slightly, similar to previous periods; wage pressures softened in many sectors but remained elevated for specialized AI roles and some lower-wage construction and manufacturing jobs [6].  \n- **Dallas (Eleventh District):** Overall wage growth was modest.

      "system_answer": "Residential real estate conditions were generally weak to flat across most districts, often with softer demand, longer listing times, and affordability concerns:\n\n- Many districts (Minneapolis, San Francisco, Atlanta, Dallas, Cleveland, St. Louis, Philadelphia) reported **declining or flat home sales and demand**, with properties staying on the market longer and builders pulling back on new starts.\n- **Inventories** were often elevated or rising (Atlanta, Dallas, San Francisco), though some markets still cited **low inventory and high prices** as constraints (Philadelphia, New York).\n- **Prices** were stabilizing or easing in several places (Richmond, San Francisco), but remained near historic highs in parts of the Atlanta district; affordability remained a significant issue (Richmond).\n- Builders relied on **incentives and discounting** to close deals in weaker markets (Dallas, San Francisco, Atlanta).\n- Some areas noted **stronger segments**, such as luxury new homes (Atlanta) or strong demand for rentals where buyers were priced out (Philadelphia), and solid housing markets with low inventory and rising prices (New York).\n\nCommercial real estate conditions were mixed by district and property type, but not generally booming:\n\n- Several districts described **flat or only slightly improved CRE activity** (Minneapolis: flat; Atlanta: little changed; San Francisco: unchanged; Boston & Richmond: slight uptick; Chicago & Philadelphia: slight increase).\n- Some districts reported **moderate declines** in CRE development or activity (Dallas earlier saw caution and short leases; Kansas City: CRE activity declined moderately; nonresidential construction down in Philadelphia; construction subdued in San Francisco).\n- **Office**: Often weak but with pockets of improvement. Minneapolis and Dallas noted improved leasing but steep office price discounts (Minneapolis) and cautious outlooks (Dallas). Atlanta and others saw higher vacancies as new supply outpaced demand; Boston and Chicago saw leasing pick up but rents flat with higher operating costs.\n- **Industrial**: Mixed. Some districts cited **muted or slowing industrial activity** due to interest-rate/tariff uncertainty (New York, San Francisco, Kansas City), while others saw **solid demand** and low vacancies, including from data centers, logistics, and manufacturing (Dallas, Chicago, Cleveland, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Kansas City).\n- **Retail**: Conditions were very location- and segment-specific—luxury retail in Manhattan was resilient while other retail was weak (New York); retail and medical office space performed well in Richmond, but big-box struggled; retail demand was strong with falling vacancies in Atlanta; rents and vacancies in Boston retail were stable with modest rent growth.\n- Overall, construction in CRE was generally **subdued or declining**, apart from specific growth areas like **data centers, health-care facilities, and infrastructure projects** (Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia, San Francisco).",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "The expected answer is brief: it says conditions in residential and commercial real estate (as interest-rate-sensitive sectors) were mixed, with some reports noting improved business lending due to lower interest rates, while others still highlighted muted activity. The key points are: (1) sectors were interest-rate-sensitive; (2) conditions were mixed; (3) some reports saw improvement (improved business lending tied to lower rates); (4) other reports still saw muted activity.\n\nThe system answer instead gives a long, highly specific narrative about generally weak-to-flat residential real estate, with various district-level details, and a similarly detailed breakdown for commercial real estate by property type and district. This is not just more detail; it conveys a qualitatively different picture: residential is portrayed as generally weak to flat rather than mixed, and there is no mention of improved business lending due to lower interest rates. The commercial real estate description is labeled as \"mixed\" in places, but overall the description is not derived from nor consistent with the brief ground-truth summary that focuses on the mixed nature and the contrast between improved lending and muted activity. It introduces many specific claims (districts, prices, vacancies, segments) that are not in the expected answer and may conflict with the high-level characterization.\n\nBecause the core required elements—\"conditions were mixed\" framed around interest-rate sensitivity, plus the explicit contrast between some improved business lending due to lower interest rates vs. other reports of muted activity—are not captured, and the system instead substitutes a different, elaborate description, this is not just incomplete but substantially misaligned with the expected answer. Thus the answer is incorrect rather than partially correct or abstained.",

In response, banks have tightened lending standards, including higher equity requirements, more scrutiny of small business loans, and limited credit access for smaller investors.",

None of these additions contradicts the expected answer, and the two core required points are correctly captured.

Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

Some respondents specified they expect customers with lower personal incomes or employed in industries driven by discretionary spending to be the most likely to face challenges. A modest increase in deposit levels was noted particularly in money market accounts and certificates of deposit, and respondents commented that customers are locking in interest rates ahead of any market rate decreases.",

In Chicago, crops were in good shape across most of the District, though soybean prices were lower due to absence of new-crop exports to China. In Atlanta, overall demand for agricultural products was healthy. Minneapolis agricultural contacts were concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases.",
      "system_answer": "Agriculture sector conditions were generally weak and under strain:\n\n- **St. Louis District:** Conditions were strained and had further deteriorated. High input costs, low commodity prices, and adverse weather led to poor crop quality (especially in non‑irrigated fields), with contacts warning that many farmers may go bankrupt or leave the industry without timely government support. Protein producers, however, reported very strong demand, with labor as the main constraint.\n\n- **Dallas District:** Growing and harvest conditions were favorable and yields strong, especially for cotton (expected best harvest in 3–4 years), but cotton and grain prices were often below profitable levels. Government price supports and crop insurance were important safety nets. Cattle prices remained high, supported by strong demand and limited supply. Outlook was clouded by the likelihood of a drier La Niña pattern.\n\n- **San Francisco District:** Agriculture and resource-related conditions weakened slightly. Foreign demand—particularly from China—fell, heat and smoke reduced fruit quality, packaging and financing costs were high, and low commodity prices strained producers. Labor shortages due to immigration changes reduced harvests and limited planned investment.\n\n- **Chicago District:** Net farm income prospects were unchanged but uncertainty was high. Corn and soy crops were mostly in good shape, though dryness and disease trimmed yields; fruit and vegetable output was subpar. Soybean and corn prices declined even with strong corn exports, while cattle and hog prices hit record highs and milk and egg prices fell. Rising fertilizer costs for 2026 heightened concern, and operators had little room left to cut expenses.\n\n- **Kansas City District:** Conditions were uneven: crop producers faced weak profit opportunities, while livestock—especially cattle—was considerably stronger. Lenders in crop-heavy areas reported widespread declines in farm income and working capital. Agricultural credit conditions deteriorated gradually, and weak crop profits weighed on farmer sentiment.\n\n- **Atlanta District:** Overall demand for agricultural products was healthy, but trade policy volatility hurt exports. Overseas rice sales fell as buyers turned to cheaper suppliers; prices for soybeans, wheat, and corn remained depressed as Chinese buyers shifted to Brazil. Domestic demand was strong for beef, poultry, peanuts, tobacco, and steady for dairy (with especially strong food‑service demand).\n\n- **Minneapolis District:** Agricultural conditions weakened. Corn and soybean production were very strong, but low prices and high expenses pressured incomes. Contacts were very concerned about China’s decision to stop purchasing U.S. soybeans.\n\n- **National/summary references:** Multiple summaries (St. Louis, Minneapolis, San Francisco) reiterated that agricultural conditions had weakened or were strained, with particular concern around trade with China and slightly pessimistic or weaker outlooks.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Overall: agriculture conditions were mixed across reporting districts.\n2) St. Louis: agriculture conditions are strained and have further deteriorated.\n3) Chicago: crops were in good shape across most of the District; soybean prices lower due to absence of new‑crop exports to China.\n4) Atlanta: overall demand for agricultural products was healthy.\n5) Minneapolis: agricultural contacts were concerned about China’s elimination of soybean purchases.\n\nCheck against system answer:\n- Overall characterization: System says \"Agriculture sector conditions were generally weak and under strain\" but then describes both weak and strong elements across districts (e.g., favorable conditions in Dallas, uneven in Kansas City, healthy demand in Atlanta). This effectively conveys mixed conditions, even if phrased more negatively.\n- St. Louis: System explicitly states conditions were strained and had further deteriorated. This matches the ground truth; it adds detail but is consistent.\n- Chicago: System says corn and soy crops were mostly in good shape, which matches \"crops were in good shape across most of the District.\" It also notes soybean and corn prices declined, but does not specify that soybean prices were lower due to the absence of new‑crop exports to China. So the specific causal link to \"absence of new‑crop exports to China\" is missing.\n- Atlanta: System states overall demand for agricultural products was healthy, matching the expected answer, and adds trade‑policy detail that is consistent with that.\n- Minneapolis: System states agricultural conditions weakened and that contacts were very concerned about China’s decision to stop purchasing U.S. soybeans, which matches the concern about China’s elimination of soybean purchases.\n\nThe system answer also introduces many additional districts (Dallas, San Francisco, Kansas City) and national references. These are extra but not contradictory. None of the included core facts contradict the ground truth. The only gap is the missing explicit statement that lower soybean prices in Chicago were specifically due to the absence of new‑crop exports to China; however, the answer does correctly capture that soybean prices declined, and gets all other key district‑level points.\n\nBecause all key district‑level conditions (St. Louis strained/deteriorated; Chicago crops in good shape; Atlanta healthy demand; Minneapolis concern about China halting soybean purchases) are present and accurate, and there are no factual contradictions relative to the expected answer, the answer is better classified as fully correct rather than merely partial.\n",

Agricultural credit conditions deteriorated gradually, and many lenders reported that weak conditions in the farm economy were having a modest negative effect on local economic conditions. Contacts remarked that strong cattle prices were supporting diversified operations but the weakness in crop profits were weighing heavily on farmer sentiment.",

The system’s phrasing \"mixed performance\" is not contradictory, given one district is growing while several are declining or flat; the detailed bullets make clear that overall is mostly down with one moderate-growth exception. There are no contradictions with the ground truth and all key points (general decline plus Atlanta moderate growth) are present. Additional details are consistent, not erroneous.\n\nTherefore the answer is fully consistent with and at least as specific as the expected answer.",

Several Districts reported neutral to cautiously optimistic or slightly pessimistic views, and in some areas (e.g., Dallas) outlooks had deteriorated due to slowing demand, policy uncertainty, and inflation.",

The omission of “and sector” is minor and not contradictory.\n- No factual errors relative to the expected answer are present, and all key elements (mixed/varied outlook, some expecting uptick in 6–12 months, many weighed down by uncertainty) are present and accurate.\n\nTherefore the system answer fully captures the key content of the expected answer with some extra but consistent detail.",

Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months.

Overall consumer spending, particularly on retail goods, inched down in recent weeks, although auto sales were boosted in some Districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September. Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

Prices rose at a moderate pace, and contacts reported they anticipate raising selling prices in 2026 at a slightly faster pace than this year. Despite the recent decline in economic activity, the majority of contacts across a broad range of sectors indicated they expect their sales and employment levels to be higher at the end of 2026 compared to 2025.",

Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong.

Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months.

Retailers and restaurants across Cape Cod, coastal New Hampshire, and Maine reported that summer spending totals rose moderately from the previous year owing to an increase in the number of day trips. The number of Canadian travelers to New England remained down sharply from the previous year, and certain parts of Cape Cod and Maine experienced weaker summer tourism activity (from the previous year) as a result. Nonetheless, tourism-related spending increased modestly overall, as domestic and other international travel compensated for the decline in Canadian visitors. Auto sales in New Hampshire increased modestly from last month, driven by the rush to purchase electric vehicles before the expiration of tax credits.

Overall consumer spending, particularly on retail goods, inched down in recent weeks, although auto sales were boosted in some Districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September. Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

In the San Francisco District, employment reductions (through attrition, layoffs, and early retirements) were in some cases “coupled with investment in artificial intelligence, particularly for positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees” [1].\n\n- In the Atlanta District, companies reported that “head count reductions were cited more frequently, and some firms expect further cuts based on early Generative AI implementation results, particularly if demand slows further” [2].\n\n- In the Kansas City District, “larger layoffs that occurred recently were associated with the adoption and implementation of AI capabilities that reduced overall labor needs” [3].\n\n- Nationally, some employers cited “increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies” as a reason for lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition [4].\n\n- In Minneapolis, contacts expected AI to have “a slight dampening effect on future labor demand,” with one advertising firm saying there would be “a smaller need for entry-level folks” because AI tools complete that work faster [5].\n\nOverall, AI adoption led some firms to cut or restrain head counts—especially in roles suited to entry-level or routine tasks—and contributed to expectations of weaker future labor demand in those areas.",

      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the expected answer: Employers cited increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies as a reason for lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. The system answer:\n- Explicitly states: “Nationally, some employers cited ‘increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies’ as a reason for lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition [4].” This directly matches the ground truth wording.\n- Adds detail and examples from specific districts (San Francisco, Atlanta, Kansas City, Minneapolis) about headcount reductions, layoffs, attrition, and dampening future labor demand linked to AI adoption.\n- These additions are consistent with and supportive of the core idea, and there are no contradictions or factual errors relative to the ground truth.\nTherefore, all key facts are present and correctly stated, with additional correct context.",

Retailers and restaurants across Cape Cod, coastal New Hampshire, and Maine reported that summer spending totals rose moderately from the previous year owing to an increase in the number of day trips. The number of Canadian travelers to New England remained down sharply from the previous year, and certain parts of Cape Cod and Maine experienced weaker summer tourism activity (from the previous year) as a result. Nonetheless, tourism-related spending increased modestly overall, as domestic and other international travel compensated for the decline in Canadian visitors.

This matches the ground truth.\n- The system correctly identifies lumber in the Twelfth District, and explains that slowing residential construction activity and increased competition allowed builders to negotiate lower prices. This is consistent with “waning demand” as the cause, so it aligns with the ground truth, just with more detail.\n- However, the system adds a third case: “Construction materials – Tenth District (Kansas City)” with a claimed price decline due to a moderate decline in commercial real estate activity and new property development. This third case is not mentioned in the expected answer and is being presented as fact. Given the evaluation standard, adding an extra, specific factual claim that is not supported by the ground truth constitutes hallucination/incorrect information.\n- The system also does not mention the contextual point that these declines occurred even as overall prices rose, but omission alone would only make it incomplete, not wrong. The main issue is the fabricated third category.\n\nBecause the answer includes an additional, unsupported materials/region/cause pair, it is not just incomplete but factually incorrect relative to the expected answer set.",

Lower- and middle-income households sought discounts and promotions due to rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. This bifurcation was driven by rising prices eroding purchasing power for lower/middle-income groups while higher-income groups remained insulated.",
      "system_answer": "Consumer spending patterns differed notably by income group:\n\n- **Higher-income households**\n  - Continued to spend on **travel, events, and luxury services** (St. Louis [1]; national summary [14]).\n  - Supported **luxury goods** and **higher-end retailers and restaurants**; luxury retail and athletic footwear “continued to perform well” (San Francisco [10]; Richmond [6]).\n  - Mid- to upper-income consumers helped keep **department store sales strong** and overall spending “modestly” higher in some districts (New York [5], [9]).\n\n- **Middle-income households**\n  - Became **more cautious**, described as facing a “middle-class recession” in some areas (St. Louis [1]).\n  - Cut back especially on **travel and select-service hotels**, and were more affected by slower business at mid-market leisure venues (St. Louis [1]).\n  - Showed increased **price sensitivity**, looking for value and comparative price shopping (Richmond [6], [11]; Minneapolis [4]).\n\n- **Lower-income households**\n  - Spending was more **volatile and deal-driven**; purchases surged around **sales, deals, and markdowns** (Kansas City [2]).\n  - Demonstrated **growing reliance on credit** (“buy now, pay later,” higher delinquencies) and **increased use of food pantries** to meet basic needs (St. Louis [1]; Boston community perspectives [7]; San Francisco community conditions [20]).\n  - Deal-seeking behavior and a focus on stretching dollars were widely reported (Minneapolis [4]; national summary [14]).\n\n**Drivers of these differences**\n\n1. **Income and financial stress**\n   - Low- and middle-income households faced **economic precarity**, difficulty paying bills, and rising use of savings and assistance, which forced them to cut or shift spending (Boston [7], [12]; San Francisco [20]).\n   - Middle-income households were **using credit to maintain spending**, leading to rising credit card delinquencies and more BNPL use (St. Louis [1]).\n\n2. **Inflation, tariffs, and higher costs**\n   - **Higher prices**, including tariff-related cost increases, squeezed budgets for lower- and middle-income households, who responded with discount-seeking and reduced discretionary spending (San Francisco [10], [13]; Cleveland [8]; Dallas [15]; national summary [14]).\n   - Retailers reported passing more of the cost increases to **mid- and high-end markets** (San Francisco [13]), which higher-income consumers were better positioned to absorb.\n\n3. **Price sensitivity and value orientation**\n   - Lower- and middle-income consumers became **highly price sensitive**, driving demand spikes tied to promotions and discounts and a broad search for “value” (Kansas City [2]; Minneapolis [4]; Richmond [6], [11]; Philadelphia [17]; national summary [14]).\n\n4. **Segment-specific demand shifts**\n   - Higher-income consumers sustained **luxury travel, luxury goods, and upscale dining** (St. Louis [1]; San Francisco [10]; Richmond [6]; national summary [14]).\n   - Lower- and middle-income households shifted toward **more affordable options** (e.g., used cars and family sedans instead of SUVs/EVs: Kansas City [2]; more fast food and family dining vs. some higher-priced travel categories: Chicago [3]).",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements of the expected answer:\n1) Pattern: Higher‑income individuals maintained strong spending on luxury travel and accommodation.\n2) Pattern: Lower‑ and middle‑income households focused on discounts/promotions and were more price sensitive.\n3) Driver: Rising prices eroded purchasing power for lower/middle‑income groups, pushing them to discounts and cutbacks.\n4) Driver: Higher‑income groups were relatively insulated from these price pressures, allowing continued luxury spending.\n\nCheck against system answer:\n- For higher‑income groups, the system states they continued to spend on “travel, events, and luxury services,” “luxury goods,” “higher‑end retailers and restaurants,” and “kept department store sales strong.” This matches the core idea that higher‑income individuals maintained strong luxury and discretionary spending.\n- For middle‑income, the system notes they became more cautious, cut back on travel/hotels, and were more price sensitive and value‑oriented. This aligns with seeking discounts/promotions and reduced discretionary spending.\n- For lower‑income, the system describes spending as “deal-driven,” surging around sales/markdowns, with strong deal‑seeking and stretching dollars—again matching the discount/promotion focus.\n- Drivers: The system explicitly mentions low- and middle‑income households facing economic precarity, difficulty paying bills, reliance on savings/assistance, and inflation/higher prices squeezing budgets, leading to discount-seeking and reduced discretionary spending. That captures “rising prices eroding purchasing power.”\n- It also notes that cost increases were passed on and that higher‑income consumers were better positioned to absorb them, i.e., they remained relatively insulated.\n\nThe system adds more detail (credit use, BNPL, segment-specific product shifts), but these are consistent extensions and not contradictory. No factual errors relative to the expected answer and all key points are present.\n\nThus the answer is fully consistent and more detailed than the ground truth, so it is correct.",

Overall employment levels were largely stable, but demand for labor was generally muted, with more employers reporting layoffs and attrition.",
      "system_answer": "The Beige Book reports that increased investment in artificial intelligence is associated with weaker labor demand and some reductions in employment, especially for lower-experience or entry-level roles:\n\n- San Francisco: Some firms reduced staff through attrition, layoffs, and early retirements while investing in AI, particularly to replace tasks done by less experienced workers.  \n- Atlanta: Firms cited early generative AI results as a reason they expect further head count cuts if demand softens.  \n- Kansas City: Some professional services firms’ larger recent layoffs were explicitly tied to adopting and implementing AI capabilities that reduced overall labor needs.  \n- Minneapolis: AI was expected to slightly dampen future labor demand, with less need for entry-level workers.  \n- National Summary: Some employers attributed head count reductions (via layoffs and attrition) partly to increased AI investment.\n\nOverall, the Beige Book links AI investment to stable or falling employment and to anticipated or actual reductions in certain types of jobs, rather than to broad-based hiring.",

      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Some employers cited increased investment in AI as one of the reasons for lowering head counts via layoffs and attrition.\n2) This occurred alongside other factors such as weaker demand and elevated economic uncertainty.\n3) Overall employment levels were largely stable.\n4) Demand for labor was generally muted, with more employers reporting layoffs and attrition.\n\nSystem answer comparison:\n- It correctly states that AI investment is associated with weaker labor demand and reductions in employment/head count (aligns with point 1: AI cited as a reason for head count cuts via layoffs and attrition). It even explicitly mentions “head count reductions (via layoffs and attrition) partly to increased AI investment,” which matches the ground truth well.\n- It correctly characterizes this as affecting demand for labor and contributing to reductions in certain job types, which is consistent with the notion of muted labor demand.\n- It says: “Overall, the Beige Book links AI investment to stable or falling employment...” which is broadly in line with the expected answer’s “Overall employment levels were largely stable” while also acknowledging reductions in some areas.\n- The answer does not explicitly mention that these AI-related reductions occur “alongside other factors like weaker demand and elevated economic uncertainty,” so it omits that nuance, but it does not contradict it.\n- It does not contradict any of the ground truth. It adds regional detail and elaboration that is compatible with the expected summary.\n\nThe missing mention of other factors (weaker demand, uncertainty) is a minor omission rather than a core factual gap; the key requested relationship (AI investment ↔ headcount reductions/ muted labor demand, with overall employment not broadly rising) is accurately conveyed. Therefore, this is best classified as correct rather than merely partial.\n",

Job turnover was low, and contacts across many industries observed softening labor market conditions. An employment placement agency reported a continued decline in demand from manufacturers, and one contact in state government observed that previously announced layoffs in agricultural machinery manufacturing had been completed. A retail industry analyst expected that hiring for the holiday season would be weaker than last year. A few contacts in manufacturing and construction said they were looking to hire new workers. One noted that fear of immigration enforcement was reducing labor availability. Another contact said that revoked visas for workers at a local factory created the need to rehire for those positions. Wages and benefits costs were up modestly overall, and many contacts cited increases in health insurance premiums.",

      "judge_reasoning": "The expected answer contrasts specific districts: growth in Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond with mixed-to-cautiously-optimistic outlooks; decline in New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco with varied outlooks (NY not expecting much increase, Kansas City broadly optimistic for 2026 despite recent declines, Minneapolis contraction). The system answer instead talks about Richmond and Atlanta as growth districts and Minneapolis, Dallas, San Francisco, New York, Cleveland as declining/flat districts. It does not mention Boston, Philadelphia, or Kansas City at all, and introduces Atlanta, Dallas, and Cleveland, which are not in the ground truth set. The general qualitative contrast (growth districts having modest expansion and cautiously positive/stable outlooks vs declining/flat districts having broad softness and weaker outlooks) is aligned in spirit, but the specific district mapping and descriptions do not match the expected answer. Key required facts (Boston neutral/cautiously optimistic with downside risks, Philadelphia modest growth with heightened uncertainty, Kansas City broadly optimistic for 2026 despite declines, Minneapolis contraction across most sectors) are missing or altered; Minneapolis is described only as \"slightly down,\" and Kansas City is not discussed. Because the question is about comparing outlooks between those specific groups of districts and the system answer substitutes a different grouping and omits key details, the answer is not just incomplete but also misaligned with the expected content. However, it does not contain explicit contradictions relative to the described outlook types (no statement that, e.g., New York expects strong growth). The problem is incompleteness and using the wrong districts rather than factual contradiction within the given frame. That fits \"partially correct\" (some correct high-level comparison, but missing many key facts), not \"incorrect.\"",

In the St. Louis District, agriculture conditions were strained and further deteriorated, with the overall pessimistic outlook. Across reporting districts, activity in agriculture was generally down, with trade uncertainty adding to sector challenges.",
      "system_answer": "Trade-related concerns generally weighed on agriculture by reducing exports and depressing prices, with notable variation by district:\n\n- **Chicago (Seventh District)**: Soybean prices were lower partly because there were no new‑crop exports to China, adding to uncertainty and dampening capital investment in farm operations.\n\n- **Atlanta (Sixth District)**: Trade policy volatility directly hurt exports. Overseas sales of U.S. rice fell as buyers turned to cheaper foreign sources. Prices and demand for export‑oriented crops like soybeans, wheat, and corn remained depressed as Chinese buyers shifted to Brazil.\n\n- **Minneapolis (Ninth District)**: Agricultural contacts were “extremely concerned” about China’s decision to stop purchasing U.S. soybeans, which, despite strong harvests, contributed to low crop prices and weaker farm incomes.\n\n- **San Francisco (Twelfth District)**: Demand from abroad, especially from China, continued to decline due to trade policy adjustments and negotiations. Combined with low commodity prices and higher costs, this put financial strain on producers and curtailed planned investment.\n\nAcross these districts, trade policy changes—especially China’s reduced purchases and a shift to other suppliers—dampened export demand, pushed down prices for key crops (notably soybeans, but also rice, wheat, and corn), heightened uncertainty, and constrained farm incomes and investment.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key points in the ground truth:\n1) Minneapolis District: agricultural contacts were specifically concerned about China’s elimination/cessation of soybean purchases (direct trade policy impact).\n2) St. Louis District: agriculture conditions were strained and deteriorating with a pessimistic outlook.\n3) Across reporting districts, agriculture activity was generally down, with trade uncertainty adding to challenges.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer correctly captures point (1): it says in the Minneapolis District, contacts were “extremely concerned” about China’s decision to stop purchasing U.S. soybeans and links this to low prices and weaker incomes. This matches the ground truth.\n- The system answer does not mention the St. Louis District at all, so point (2) is missing.\n- The system answer does capture a generalized, cross‑district impact from trade policy and uncertainty: reduced exports, lower prices, heightened uncertainty, weaker incomes and investment. This is consistent with point (3) that activity was generally down and trade uncertainty added to challenges.\n- There are no explicit contradictions with the ground truth; however, the answer introduces details about Chicago, Atlanta, and San Francisco that are not in the expected answer. While these are not necessarily incorrect, they go beyond what is required and still omit a key required district (St. Louis).\n\nBecause a major required component (the St. Louis District condition and pessimistic outlook) is missing, but the Minneapolis point and the general cross‑district impact are correctly captured and there are no factual contradictions, the answer is incomplete but not misleading overall.\n\nTherefore, it is partially correct.",

Cattle and hog prices increased to record territory, while milk and egg prices declined. Concerns about higher input costs for 2026 intensified due to rising fertilizer prices.

      "expected_answer": "In the New York District, nonprofits faced challenges due to unpredictable funding and reduction in federal benefit programs, with a community health-care center reporting financial distress among Medicaid patients. In the Cleveland District, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to uncertainty around federal grants. In the Boston District, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health-care sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Federal policy changes reduced and destabilized funding and benefits that nonprofits rely on, which:\n\n- Cut or made federal grants and benefit programs (like Medicaid and other federal supports) more uncertain, causing nonprofits to:\n  - Delay hiring or leave positions unfilled because of unclear grant prospects (Cleveland).\n  - Face unpredictable funding and direct reductions in federal benefit programs, straining finances and limiting services (New York, San Francisco).\n  - Plan for smaller budgets and seek new or alternative funding streams, including new revenue-generating activities (Chicago, Dallas).\n- Increased demand for services at the same time:\n  - Reductions or planned cuts to federal benefit programs (SNAP, Medicaid) and other policy-driven pressures raised financial distress among low- and moderate-income households, leading to greater reliance on nonprofits for basics like food, housing, and health care (Boston, New York, San Francisco, St. Louis, Dallas, Cleveland).\n  \nAcross districts, the combined effect was higher demand for nonprofit services alongside more volatile or reduced federal-related funding, forcing nonprofits to tap reserves, cut or reprioritize services, and experiment with new revenue models.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) New York District: nonprofits faced challenges due to unpredictable funding and reduction in federal benefit programs; a community health‑care center reported financial distress among Medicaid patients.\n2) Cleveland District: nonprofits were not filling open positions due to uncertainty around federal grants.\n3) Boston District: cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health‑care sectors.\n\nCheck against system answer:\n- New York: The system says nonprofits \"Face unpredictable funding and direct reductions in federal benefit programs, straining finances and limiting services (New York, San Francisco)\" and later that reductions in programs like SNAP and Medicaid raised financial distress among low‑ and moderate‑income households (including New York). This captures the key idea of unpredictable funding, reductions in federal benefits, and financial distress among Medicaid/low‑income patients. This matches the ground truth, albeit more generalized.\n- Cleveland: The system says nonprofits \"Delay hiring or leave positions unfilled because of unclear grant prospects (Cleveland).\" This aligns with \"not filling open positions due to uncertainty around federal grants.\" Correct.\n- Boston: The system only mentions Boston in the context of \"reductions or planned cuts to federal benefit programs\" increasing demand, but it does NOT mention that cuts to federal grant funding caused layoffs in the education and health‑care sectors. That specific impact (layoffs in education and health care in Boston) is missing.\n\nAdditionally, the system introduces other districts (San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas, St. Louis) and broader effects. These extra details are not in the expected answer but are not necessarily wrong, assuming they come from the wider context. There is no explicit contradiction of the expected answer, but a key element (Boston layoffs in education and health care) is omitted.\n\nTherefore, the answer is accurate on New York and Cleveland but incomplete for Boston, so it is partially correct rather than fully correct.",

Since we are judging against the expected answer, those extra districts are unsupported and likely incorrect in this context.\n\nThus, while the sectors match, the district-level information is largely incorrect relative to the ground truth, and the key Boston-related detail is missing. This makes the overall answer factually wrong with respect to which districts most prominently mentioned these shortages.\n",

Other firms facing tariff-induced cost pressures kept selling prices largely unchanged to preserve market share and due to pushback from price-sensitive clients. In Chicago, a retail industry analyst expected peak tariff impact in the first half of 2026.",
      "system_answer": "Firms’ pricing responses to tariff-driven cost increases varied by sector and competitive conditions:\n\n- **Retail and consumer goods**\n  - Some large retailers used **selective price increases based on demand elasticity** (raising prices more where customers were less price sensitive) and sought **alternative inputs** to limit cost pass-through [1, 8].\n  - Many retailers tried to **delay or limit pass-through**, “holding off” on price hikes as long as possible; some smaller retailers had already **raised prices** because of tariffs [9].\n  - Others used **targeted increases** (only on select items) and **more discounting and promotions** to sustain demand [8, 14].\n  - In mid- to high-end segments, retailers reported **passing a sizable portion of higher import costs to consumers** [7].\n  - Some foreign producers cut their own prices to offset tariffs and help U.S. retailers/manufacturers hold the line on final prices [6].\n\n- **Manufacturing**\n  - Many manufacturers **raised output prices** modestly or introduced **tariff-related surcharges** to cover higher costs for metals, components, and chemicals [3, 6, 8, 9, 16].\n  - Some **fully passed through** higher import costs to customers, especially in manufacturing and related wholesale trades [4].\n  - Others **held prices steady despite higher costs** to preserve or gain market share, especially where demand was weak or customers were price sensitive [4, 8].\n  - A few firms adjusted products (e.g., **reconfiguring goods to cut costs and lower prices**) rather than raising prices directly [18].\n\n- **Autos and durable goods**\n  - Some auto manufacturers **absorbed tariff costs** on new vehicles to avoid further demand declines [2].\n  - In contrast, some contacts noted **increased incentives/discounts on autos** when they could not fully pass through higher costs [14].\n\n- **Food, restaurants, and beverages**\n  - Some food and beverage producers (e.g., brewers, specialty appliance makers) **raised prices—sometimes multiple times—to account for tariffs** on inputs and packaging [1].\n  - Restaurants often faced higher food costs (notably beef) but **kept menu prices mostly unchanged**, leading to squeezed margins; where customers resisted higher prices, some restaurants instead **reduced portion sizes or changed recipes** [1, 7, 13].\n\n- **Services (including professional services and insurance)**\n  - Some service providers reported **little pushback** and were able to **raise prices** despite higher costs [2, 10].\n  - Others faced resistance and so **bundled services or benefits** (e.g., in insurance) rather than straightforwardly increasing price per unit [7].\n  - Several professional services firms **raised their prices** explicitly in response to tariffs and competitors doing the same [10].\n\n- **General patterns across sectors**\n  - Responses ranged from **absorbing costs**, **partial pass-through**, **full pass-through**, and **non-price adjustments** (product changes, portion size reductions, shorter price guarantees).\n  - Firms with **stronger pricing power or higher-end customer bases** were more likely to **raise prices**, while those facing **price-sensitive customers or weak demand** were more likely to **absorb costs, discount, or adjust offerings** instead of straightforward price hikes [2, 4, 7, 8, 14].",

That matches points (1)–(3) and is consistent with the expected answer.\n- For retail, it states some retailers passed a sizable portion of higher import costs to consumers and others delayed or limited pass‑through, holding off on price hikes because of customer price sensitivity, which is again aligned with (2) and (3).\n- It adds more sectoral detail (autos, food, services) and general patterns, but these additions do not contradict the ground truth.\n- However, the expected answer contains a specific point about “In Chicago, a retail industry analyst expected peak tariff impact in the first half of 2026.” The system answer does not mention Chicago, a retail analyst, or the timing of peak impact (H1 2026) at all. That is a missing key detail.\n\nThe answer is accurate and richer than required, but it omits one specific key fact from the expected answer, so it is incomplete rather than fully correct.\n",

However, in the Chicago District, light vehicle sales declined overall, especially for EVs following the end of federal tax credits.

      "system_answer": "Federal policy—in particular, the impending expiration of the federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credit at the end of September—stimulated a rush of EV purchases. Multiple Districts (Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Boston) reported a surge or brisk sales of EVs specifically tied to the end of these tax incentives. \n\nThis policy-driven spike in EV demand helped prop up overall auto sales:  \n- In the National Summary, auto sales were said to be “boosted in some Districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit.”  \n- Philadelphia noted auto sales would have declined more without the rush to buy EVs before the tax credit expired.  \n- Boston and Atlanta both cited increased auto sales or robust new EV sales driven by the impending end of the credit.  \n\nSo, the expiring federal EV tax credit temporarily increased EV sales and thereby supported or boosted overall auto sales that otherwise would have been weaker.",

The answer only describes the pre‑expiration surge and does not mention the subsequent drop or the specific Chicago outcome.\n- There are no clear factual errors, but a core aspect of the expected answer—the post‑expiration decline, particularly in Chicago—is missing.\n\nBecause the answer captures the pre‑expiration stimulus effect but not the post‑expiration decline (a central part of the expected relationship), it is incomplete rather than fully correct.",

However, labor cost pressures intensified due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses. Additionally, some contacts in the Chicago District reported moderate increases in nonlabor costs including energy and higher prices for raw materials. This meant total compensation costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.",
      "system_answer": "Multiple factors affected labor costs:\n\n1. **Wage increases themselves**  \n   - Wages were rising in all Districts, generally at a modest to moderate pace.  \n   - Certain sectors (e.g., hospitality and tourism, some construction, leisure and hospitality, and specialized tech/AI roles) saw stronger wage gains, often 3% or more.\n\n2. **Employer health insurance expenses**  \n   - The National Summary explicitly notes that “labor cost pressures intensified in recent weeks due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses.”  \n   - Several Districts (e.g., Chicago and St. Louis) also mentioned higher health insurance premiums or increased employer contributions as adding to costs.\n\n3. **Other benefits and nonwage costs**  \n   - Some employers increased benefits (like health insurance contributions or cost-of-living adjustments) even when wage growth was only moderate, adding to overall labor costs.\n\n**Interaction with wage growth:**\n\n- Even though wage growth was described as modest to moderate and in some cases easing, total labor costs were rising faster because of these nonwage components—especially sharp increases in employer health insurance costs and benefit enhancements (such as cost-of-living adjustments and higher insurance contributions).  \n- Thus, overall labor cost pressures were stronger than wage growth alone would suggest, as rising benefit and insurance costs layered on top of modest wage increases.",

Instead, it adds other benefit-related factors and generic nonwage costs, which are not in the ground truth and omits the specific energy/raw materials cost pressures.\n\nAll included facts are consistent with the ground truth, but one key element (nonlabor costs: energy and raw materials) is missing. The answer is accurate for the factors it does cover and correctly characterizes their interaction with wage growth, but it is incomplete relative to the expected answer.\n\nThus, the answer is partially correct, not fully correct.",

Sales, deals, and markdowns reportedly drove small surges in purchasing activity for certain businesses, especially purchases by lower income households that need to be more selective. Sales of goods, particularly automotive and sporting goods, declined moderately, underscoring the uneven pullback in household spending between goods and services. Contacts at auto dealerships indicated demand continued to shift from SUVs and electric vehicles to family sedans and used vehicles. To manage softer sales, several firms reported they reduced staffing hours and have grown more cautious about passing along higher input costs in the near term, instead focusing on constraining cost growth.

Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months.

In Chicago, financial conditions loosened modestly with business loan volumes increasing.

This aligns with point (2).\n- It does *not* mention Chicago business loan volumes or loosened financial conditions; instead, it mentions Chicago only in the context of consumer lending and mortgage refinancing. That misses the specific expected point (3), though it is not contradictory.\n- It introduces St. Louis, San Francisco, New York, Atlanta, national summary. These are not in the expected answer, but they are not stated to be wrong; they reflect additional context, still consistent with a “mixed and sector‑specific” impact across districts.\n- However, it omits the specific expected facts that residential real estate remained weak in Dallas and home sales were flat in Boston. It only gives a generic national summary that residential and commercial real estate were “mixed,” with some improvement and continued softness. That is less specific than the ground truth and does not capture the Dallas/Boston examples.\n- It does convey the qualitative idea that interest-rate-sensitive sectors had mixed outcomes, with commercial/construction generally more supported than other areas, which is aligned with point (5).\n- There are no outright contradictions of the ground truth.\n\nBecause the system answer includes some key ground-truth elements (Cleveland, mixed/sector‑specific effects, commercial vs housing differences) but misses others (Chicago business loan volumes, Dallas weakness, Boston flat home sales) while not being factually wrong, it is incomplete but not misleading.\n\nThus the appropriate verdict is PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

Federal grant uncertainty affected nonprofits (Cleveland, New York, Boston). Policy uncertainty was a top business concern (Dallas). Immigration policy changes created labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston). The potential for government shutdown was highlighted as a downside risk. Kansas City noted that despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic.",
      "system_answer": "Several specific factors in the context contributed to economic uncertainty across districts:\n\n- **Rising living costs and reduced support (Boston District)**  \n  - Greater difficulty paying rent, utilities, and other bills.  \n  - Increased food pantry use and reliance on savings for basic needs.  \n  - Planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid.  \n  - Further consumer price increases linked to tariffs.  \n  - Workforce housing shortages and rising construction costs.\n\n- **Strains on nonprofits and social services (Chicago District)**  \n  - Nonprofits anticipating smaller budgets and needing new funding streams.  \n  - Higher operating costs (e.g., insurance) alongside reduced income and donations.  \n  - Need to prioritize which services to maintain.\n\n- **Labor market and immigration-related uncertainty (Atlanta District)**  \n  - A \"hiring chill,\" low turnover, and increased head count reductions.  \n  - Expected further job cuts tied to generative AI if demand slows.  \n  - Material impacts from changes in immigration policy and enforcement, especially in agriculture and hospitality.  \n  - Uncertainty around both labor supply and consumer demand weighing on hiring plans.\n\n- **Weakening demand and funding cuts (San Francisco District)**  \n  - Rising demand for assistance (food, basic necessities, health care) alongside funding and grant cuts.  \n  - Small businesses facing lower demand, strained finances, reduced investment, more closures, and shorter operating hours.  \n  - Some decline in demand attributed to customer behavior changes in response to immigration policy.\n\n- **Consumer caution and demand risks (Minneapolis & St. Louis Districts)**  \n  - Lower retail, hospitality, and tourism spending, with firms expecting continued weakness.  \n  - Businesses noting “economic uncertainties” creating caution and curtailing vacation spending.  \n  - Rising use of credit, “buy now, pay later,” and increased credit card delinquencies.  \n  - Businesses describing conditions as a “middle-class recession.”\n\n- **Policy and inflation concerns (Dallas & Philadelphia Districts)**  \n  - In Dallas, outlooks worsened with weakening demand, domestic policy uncertainty, and inflation as primary concerns.  \n  - In Philadelphia, firms reported cost pressures from tariffs and other expenses, planned price increases, and cited downside risk from a potential prolonged government shutdown.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements in the expected answer:\n1) Tariff policy changes made planning difficult for manufacturers (Chicago and across districts).\n2) Federal grant uncertainty affecting nonprofits (Cleveland, New York, Boston).\n3) Policy uncertainty as a top business concern (Dallas).\n4) Immigration policy changes creating labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston).\n5) Potential for government shutdown as a downside risk.\n6) Kansas City noted that despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic.\n\nComparison to system answer:\n- Tariffs: System mentions “further consumer price increases linked to tariffs” (Boston) and “cost pressures from tariffs” (Philadelphia), but it does not tie these to manufacturers’ planning difficulties or to Chicago. So the central point about tariff policy complicating manufacturers’ planning is missing/misdirected.\n- Federal grants: System talks about “funding and grant cuts” and nonprofit strain (Chicago, San Francisco) but not the specific “federal grant uncertainty” in Cleveland, New York, and Boston. So this factor is only vaguely and partially reflected, and in different districts.\n- Policy uncertainty (Dallas): System correctly notes “domestic policy uncertainty” as a primary concern in Dallas. This matches one key factor.\n- Immigration policy and labor supply: System attributes immigration policy impacts to Atlanta and San Francisco (and some demand effects), but the expected answer specifies labor supply concerns in St. Louis and Boston. The essence (immigration policy as a source of uncertainty) is there, but the districts and emphasis (labor supply) don’t match.\n- Government shutdown risk: System correctly notes “downside risk from a potential prolonged government shutdown” in Philadelphia. This matches.\n- Kansas City 2026 expectations: Not mentioned at all in the system answer.\n\nAdditionally, the system introduces many other uncertainty sources (rising living costs, SNAP/Medicaid cuts, AI-related job cuts, middle-class recession, consumer credit issues, etc.) that are not in the expected answer. These are not necessarily false, but they are extra and distract from several missing key factors (Chicago/manufacturers’ tariff-planning problem, federal grant uncertainty in the specified districts, Kansas City expectations).\n\nOverall, some core factors (policy uncertainty in Dallas, shutdown risk, immigration policy as a general source of uncertainty) are captured, but several specific required elements and district mappings are missing or off. There are no clear factual contradictions relative to the expected answer, just incompleteness and some misalignment of districts. That fits “PARTIALLY_CORRECT.”",

      "expected_answer": "Several service-related costs drove input cost increases: insurance, health care, and technology solutions all saw higher costs. In New York, rising business costs including insurance added to financial pressures for community service providers. Employer-sponsored health insurance expenses saw outsized increases, intensifying labor cost pressures across districts. These service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.",
      "system_answer": "Service-related costs that contributed to input cost increases included:\n\n- **Insurance (especially liability and trucking insurance)**  \n  - Reported sharp or significant increases in several Districts (Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, St. Louis logistics firms).  \n  - A logistics firm noted sharply rising trucking insurance premiums compressing margins.  \n  - A professional and business services firm reported insurance premiums rising faster than revenues.\n\n- **Health care costs**  \n  - Noted as rising in multiple Districts (National Summary, Philadelphia, Dallas, Minneapolis), including nearly 10 percent increases in some cases.  \n  - These increases affected service firms (e.g., professional and business services, hospitals) by adding to nonlabor cost pressures and worsening financial distress in at least one hospital.\n\n- **Technology / IT and technology solutions**  \n  - Banking and professional and business services contacts reported elevated technology costs (Cleveland, National Summary).  \n  - Prices for IT services rose moderately (Boston).  \n  - Higher costs for technology solutions added to input cost pressures, particularly in business and financial services.\n\n- **Utilities (electricity and general utilities)**  \n  - Manufacturers and other firms noted rising utilities costs (Cleveland, San Francisco manufacturing, Minneapolis).  \n  - These affected manufacturing sectors through higher production and operating costs.\n\n**Effects across sectors:**\n\n- **Manufacturing:** Faced higher utilities and technology-related costs, alongside tariffs. Many manufacturers raised output prices modestly or added surcharges; smaller manufacturers passed through a larger share of cost increases.\n\n- **Professional and business services:** Squeezed by faster-rising insurance and health-care premiums than revenues; some raised prices to clients.\n\n- **Logistics and transportation:** Trucking insurance premiums rose sharply, compressing margins.\n\n- **Restaurants and hospitality:** Rising insurance and other service inputs (plus food costs) reduced profitability, with limited ability to raise prices.\n\n- **Health care (hospitals):** Higher health-care–related operating costs contributed to financial distress at a hospital despite federal support.\n\nAcross these sectors, higher service-related input costs (insurance, health care, technology, utilities) increased overall cost pressures, often compressing margins where firms could not fully pass the costs on to customers.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Service-related costs driving input cost increases were insurance, health care, and technology solutions.\n2) In New York, rising business costs including insurance added to financial pressures for community service providers.\n3) Employer-sponsored health insurance expenses saw outsized increases, intensifying labor cost pressures across districts.\n4) These increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.\n\nCheck against system answer:\n1) The system clearly identifies insurance, health care costs, and technology / IT and technology solutions as key service-related costs contributing to input cost increases. This directly matches the core elements of the expected answer.\n2) The system does not explicitly mention New York or community service providers; instead it gives a broader, multi-district description (Boston, Philadelphia, etc.). This is a missing specific detail relative to the ground truth, but not a contradiction.\n3) The system does describe health care costs and employer-related health costs as rising in multiple districts and adding to nonlabor cost pressures and financial distress, which is consistent with the idea of employer-sponsored health insurance expenses seeing outsized increases, though it does not use that specific phrase. It is directionally consistent and not incorrect.\n4) The system answer does not mention that these service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases; that piece of context is missing.\n5) The user also asked how this affected different sectors. The system answer gives a detailed sectoral breakdown: manufacturing, professional and business services, logistics and transportation, restaurants and hospitality, health care. This goes beyond the expected answer and is consistent with the context.\n6) There are no evident factual errors or contradictions with the expected answer; the system answer is more detailed but aligned.\n\nThe only issues are omissions (no explicit New York/community service provider example, no explicit mention of tariffs), not inaccuracies. The main requested content—what service-related costs and how they affected sectors—is fully and accurately covered. That satisfies the key requirements, with extra correct detail.\n\nTherefore the answer is best classified as correct rather than merely partial, since all core elements (insurance, health care, technology solutions as drivers; explanation of sectoral effects) are present and accurate, and missing minor contextual details do not undermine correctness for the question asked.",

Categories seeing gains included restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments, as well as new light vehicle sales which were brisk due to strong underlying demand and the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases. Categories seeing softness included travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels. Used vehicle sales remained steady though dealerships in low-to-moderate income communities reported softer demand. This pattern reflects consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.",
      "system_answer": "Across the reports, gains tended to occur in higher-end, convenience, and specific durable-goods niches, while declines were concentrated in price-sensitive, discretionary, and big-ticket categories. This pattern shows consumers trading down, becoming more value-focused, and behaving very differently by income group.\n\n**Categories seeing gains or relative strength:**\n- **Luxury and higher-end goods/services**\n  - Luxury retail and services (San Francisco: luxury goods; Richmond & Boston: luxury hotels, higher-end retailers; St. Louis: luxury travel/events).\n  - Cosmetics and fragrances (New York).\n- **Quick-service and value-oriented food away from home**\n  - Fast food, fast casual, and family dining (Chicago).\n  - Quick service restaurants and some entertainment venues (San Francisco services; Richmond).\n- **Certain autos and EVs**\n  - Strong/new EV sales ahead of expiring tax credits (Atlanta, Boston tourism/retail; Chicago new light vehicles).\n  - Slight increase in auto sales in parts of New York; used vehicles relatively strong in Cleveland and increasingly favored in Kansas City.\n- **Selected durables and home-related items**\n  - Appliances, computers, and landscaping (Chicago).\n  - Replacement windows (Richmond, tied to renovation vs. moving).\n- **Health-related and business services**\n  - Health-related food services and business technology (San Francisco services).\n  - Health care retail had flat to slight increases (Dallas).\n\n**Categories seeing declines or softness:**\n- **General retail and many consumer goods**\n  - Overall non-auto retail soft or slightly down in several districts (Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, San Francisco, Kansas City, Cleveland, Minneapolis).\n  - Weaker sales for building materials, garden equipment, furniture, electronics & appliances in some areas (Dallas; Chicago notes declines in some consumer electronics and building materials).\n  - Softer demand for food products, beverages, clothing, pet supplies, and more affordable goods (San Francisco retail).\n- **Restaurants and discretionary dining**\n  - Pullbacks at restaurants via skipping desserts and alcoholic drinks (Atlanta).\n  - Weakness at casual/full‑service restaurants (Richmond, San Francisco services; some closures in Pacific Northwest).\n- **Autos and big-ticket goods**\n  - Weak auto sales overall in several districts (Dallas, Cleveland, Kansas City), with especially soft demand for SUVs and EVs in Kansas City as consumers shift to sedans and used cars.\n- **Travel, hospitality, tourism**\n  - Softer tourism and business travel in several districts (San Francisco tourist retail; Richmond travel mixed; Cleveland and Minneapolis tourism down; St. Louis reports weaker middle-class travel and select-service hotels; Atlanta and Chicago note softness in some travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels).\n  - Lower elective health procedures (San Francisco services).\n\n**What this reveals about consumer behavior:**\n- **Heightened price sensitivity and “value-seeking”:**\n  - Multiple districts explicitly note consumers are more “value aware,” looking for deals, and responding to sales and discounts (Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Richmond).\n  - Retailers are using markdowns to spur demand (Kansas City; Cleveland price discussions).\n- **Income bifurcation:**\n  - Mid- to upper-income consumers are still spending on luxury goods, upscale travel, cosmetics, and high-end accommodations (New York, Boston, San Francisco, St. Louis), while:\n  - Middle- and lower-income consumers are cutting back, relying more on credit, “buy now, pay later,” and food pantries, and shifting to cheaper options (St. Louis, Kansas City, Cleveland, Minneapolis).\n- **Category reallocation rather than broad collapse:**\n  - Consumers are reducing discretionary add-ons (desserts, alcohol, elective procedures, premium travel) but still buying necessities and selectively upgrading in targeted areas (e.g., EVs before tax credits expire, appliances, computers, quick-service dining).\n- **Sensitivity to tariffs and cost increases:**\n  - Higher prices linked to tariffs are cited repeatedly as dampening demand and making households more cautious, especially for goods categories (Dallas, San Francisco, Atlanta, Cleveland, Richmond).\n\nOverall, consumers are not uniformly cutting spending; they are reshuffling it—maintaining or increasing purchases in luxury, value/convenience food, and tax-incentive-driven autos, while pulling back on mid-priced discretionary goods, full-service dining, and non-essential travel, especially among more price-constrained households.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements of the expected answer:\n- Geography is Chicago.\n- Gains: fast food, fast casual, family dining; new light vehicle sales brisk due to strong demand and end of EV tax incentives.\n- Softness/declines: travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels.\n- Used vehicle sales steady overall, but softer demand at dealerships in low-to-moderate income communities.\n- Interpretation: consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.\n\nSystem answer:\n- Does mention \"Fast food, fast casual, and family dining (Chicago)\" and \"Chicago new light vehicles\" under categories seeing gains, consistent with the ground truth.\n- Also notes \"Atlanta and Chicago note softness in some travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels,\" which matches the expected travel softness.\n- However, it adds a great deal of cross-district material not in the expected answer and generalizes across many regions, not focusing on Chicago as requested in the ground truth.\n- It does not mention that used vehicle sales remained steady overall with softer demand in low-to-moderate income communities; instead it talks about used vehicles in other districts (Cleveland, Kansas City) with different patterns.\n- The behavioral interpretation: the system emphasizes trading down, income bifurcation, price sensitivity, category reallocation, tariffs, etc. The ground truth wants: consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel. The system’s description partially overlaps (value focus, cutting back on some discretionary travel) but is much broader and not specifically tied to the Chicago pattern.\n- There are no direct factual contradictions with the specific Chicago points from the ground truth that it does mention, but the answer is incomplete relative to that Chicago-focused expected answer and diluted with extraneous, out-of-scope details.\n\nThus, some key facts (restaurant gains, new light vehicle strength, softness in travel, value-seeking behavior) are present and accurate, but other key points (used vehicle steady overall but softer in low/mod-income areas; concise behavioral framing specific to Chicago) are missing, and the answer is overly generalized.

Leisure and hospitality sales were mixed, with softness in some travel-related categories, including airlines and hotels, but increased spending at restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments. New light vehicle sales were brisk, reflecting a combination of strong underlying demand and the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases. Used vehicle sales remained steady, though dealerships located in low-to-moderate income communities reported softer demand.",

      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Energy sector performance varied significantly across districts.\n2) Atlanta (Sixth District): energy grew moderately and was a positive outlier relative to mostly weaker conditions elsewhere.\n3) Dallas (Eleventh District): drilling and well completion activity was flat.\n4) Nationally: energy activity was generally down among reporting districts.\n5) Chicago District: noted higher energy prices as part of nonlabor cost increases affecting manufacturers.\n\nComparison with system answer:\n- The system correctly states that performance varied by district and that in Atlanta energy \"grew/expanded moderately\" with most segments growing at a moderate pace. This matches the core point about moderate growth in Atlanta, though it does not explicitly call it a \"positive outlier\" but the characterization is consistent.\n- For Dallas, the expected answer specifies “drilling and well completion activity was flat.” The system says “drilling activity and oil production were flat.” That is not the same as “well completion activity” and introduces a different concept (oil production) that is not in the ground truth, and it omits the explicit mention of well completions. This is at least a divergence from the expected detail and likely incorrect relative to the source text described in the ground truth.\n- The expected answer says nationally energy activity was generally down among reporting districts. The system does not clearly articulate this national characterization, though it lists several districts with decreased or weakened activity (Kansas City, Minneapolis, San Francisco). The explicit national summary point is missing.\n- The expected answer highlights the Chicago District’s mention of higher energy prices as part of nonlabor cost increases. The system answer does not mention Chicago or this point at all.\n- The system adds substantial extra detail for several districts (Kansas City, Minneapolis, San Francisco, New York) that are not in the expected answer. These may or may not be correct relative to the underlying context, but for this task we judge against the expected answer. The extra material does not fix the omission of the Chicago point and the national summary. Also, the rephrasing for Dallas appears inconsistent with the ground truth.\n\nGiven that some key facts (Atlanta moderate growth, variation by district, generally weaker activity in several districts) align, but other key required elements (Chicago’s energy price point, explicit national-down characterization, precise Dallas description) are missing or altered, the answer is incomplete and somewhat divergent but not outright contradicting the core directional story. Thus it is best categorized as partially correct rather than fully correct or fully incorrect.",

      "question": "How did banking conditions differ for consumer versus business lending across districts?",
      "expected_answer": "In Kansas City, while expectations for 2026 were optimistic, consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately, signaling stress among households. In Chicago, business loan demand decreased slightly on net with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity, while consumer loan demand increased slightly with a pickup in mortgage refinancing. In Dallas, loan demand grew overall. St. Louis reported banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions. Consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.",
      "system_answer": "Banking conditions for consumer versus business lending varied by district as follows:\n\n- **Philadelphia (3rd District)**  \n  - **Business lending:** Strong decline in commercial & industrial loans and modest decline in commercial real estate; overall lending volumes down, with weaker demand particularly from commercial clients.  \n  - **Consumer lending:** Most categories were stronger—non‑auto, non‑card consumer loans rose strongly; home equity lines increased moderately; auto loans rose modestly; mortgages edged up; credit card volumes fell modestly.\n\n- **Kansas City (10th District)**  \n  - **Business lending:** Loan demand and credit standards largely unchanged across categories; no specific deterioration noted for business portfolios.  \n  - **Consumer lending:** Moderate deterioration in consumer lending portfolios, with expectations of further challenges as disposable income falls, especially for lower‑income and discretionary‑sector borrowers.\n\n- **St. Louis (8th District)**  \n  - **Business lending:** Overall moderate loan demand with strong commercial loan demand in some areas, though small business demand was depressed but rebuilding; lending standards tightened, especially for small business loans.  \n  - **Consumer lending:** Consumer delinquency rates have been steadily increasing and are expected to continue rising; more borrowers seeking credit counseling after borrowing to maintain spending.\n\n- **Atlanta (6th District)**  \n  - **Business lending:** Corporate loan demand muted; overall loan growth flat.  \n  - **Consumer lending:** Overall consumer lending contracted further, despite a small uptick in HELOC applications; delinquencies ticked up.\n\n- **New York (2nd District)**  \n  - **Business lending:** Overall loan demand declined mainly because of weaker business loan demand; delinquency rates worsened slightly, especially for business loans.  \n  - **Consumer lending:** Demand for consumer loans and commercial mortgages held steady; residential mortgage demand grew moderately with strong volumes.\n\n- **Chicago (7th District)**  \n  - **Business lending:** Business loan demand decreased slightly; loan quality declined modestly and terms tightened, even as rates fell.  \n  - **Consumer lending:** Consumer loan demand increased slightly (including more mortgage refinancing); loan quality flat, rates edged down, and terms also tightened slightly.\n\n- **Dallas (11th District)**  \n  - **Business lending:** Overall loan demand increased; continued tightening of credit standards and terms for most non‑residential loan types; commercial real estate loan performance improved sharply.  \n  - **Consumer lending:** Residential real estate credit standards and terms eased slightly; future standards expected to tighten for all loan types except residential real estate.\n\n- **Richmond (5th District)**  \n  - **Business lending:** Demand for most loan types stable, with some modest increase in commercial loan demand; some borrowers remain cautious.  \n  - **Consumer lending:** A modest increase in delinquencies mainly in consumer loan portfolios, including mortgages and home equity loans.\n\n- **Cleveland (4th District)**  \n  - **Business lending:** Business loan demand increased moderately along with household demand; expectations of a sharp future increase in overall loan demand.  \n  - **Consumer lending:** Household loan demand also increased moderately; overall delinquency rates reported as flat.\n\n- **San Francisco (12th District)**  \n  - **Business lending:** Demand for commercial loans generally muted, though stronger in parts of Arizona due to semiconductor projects.  \n  - **Consumer lending:** The provided context does not describe consumer lending conditions specifically in this district.\n\nOverall across districts, business lending often showed muted or declining demand (except some strength in selected commercial segments), with some deterioration in business loan quality in places like New York and Chicago. Consumer lending was mixed: in some districts it grew or remained steady (Philadelphia, Chicago, New York mortgages), while in others it contracted or showed rising delinquencies and portfolio deterioration (Atlanta, Kansas City, St. Louis, Richmond).",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth focuses only on Kansas City, Chicago, Dallas, and St. Louis, and specifies key contrasts:\n- Kansas City: consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately while expectations for 2026 were optimistic (the optimism is more macro/forward-looking); stress among households.\n- Chicago: business loan demand decreased slightly on net, with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity; consumer loan demand increased slightly with pickup in mortgage refinancing.\n- Dallas: loan demand grew overall.\n- St. Louis: banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions; consumer lending showed some signs of stress; business lending conditions were mixed.\n\nThe system answer:\n- For Kansas City: correctly notes moderate deterioration in consumer lending portfolios and falling disposable income for lower-income borrowers, consistent with consumer stress; business lending “largely unchanged across categories,” which doesn’t contradict the ground truth (which is silent on business lending specifics). It omits the explicit optimism for 2026, but that is context rather than core to the consumer vs business contrast.\n- For Chicago: matches that business loan demand decreased slightly and consumer loan demand increased slightly, including more mortgage refinancing—this aligns well with the expected answer.\n- For Dallas: states that overall loan demand increased, which is consistent with “loan demand grew overall.”\n- For St. Louis: notes rising consumer delinquencies and consumer stress and describes business lending as having strong commercial demand in some areas but weak small-business demand and tightened standards—this is compatible with “consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.” It adds detail but does not contradict the ground truth.\n\nThe rest of the system answer covers many other districts not mentioned in the expected answer, but those additions are not contradicted by the expected answer. There are no factual contradictions relative to the ground truth for the four districts that matter, and all key contrasts (consumer vs business, directions of demand and stress) are present. Missing the phrase about optimistic expectations for 2026 in Kansas City does not change the accuracy of the described banking conditions. Therefore the answer is complete and accurate with respect to the expected answer, albeit more detailed and broader in scope.\n\nVerdict: correct.",

Employment in IT services increased modestly with hiring in sales and technical positions - a relative bright spot.

Many firms held head counts flat or trimmed staff, hiring mainly to replace turnover or for very specific growth areas, while some sectors (like finance) continued modest hiring.\n\nThis pattern indicates weaker employer confidence: businesses are wary about future demand and economic conditions, avoiding aggressive expansion of staff, emphasizing cost control, and in some cases delaying or canceling planned hires.",

This aligns with points 1 and 2 in substance.\n- Says many firms held headcounts flat or trimmed staff, hiring mainly to replace turnover or specific growth areas: consistent with cautious behavior and non-expansionary hiring.\n- Interprets this as weaker employer confidence, wariness about future demand, avoiding aggressive expansion, emphasizing cost control, delaying/canceling hires. This matches the gist of point 6.\n\nMissing specifics:\n- No mention of Boston’s pattern of modest increases in both hiring and layoffs (churn rather than net growth).\n- No mention of IT services as a relative bright spot with sales/technical hiring.\n- No mention of Cleveland jobseekers seeing more part-time offers with low/no benefits.\n\nThere are no clear factual contradictions with the expected answer; the system answer remains in the same qualitative direction. However, it omits several concrete, location-/sector-specific details that are part of the ground truth.

Employment was flat (matching national stable levels). Wages and benefits costs were up modestly (matching national modest-to-moderate). Prices rose moderately (matching national rising trend). Financial conditions loosened slightly (better than mixed national picture). Construction/real estate increased slightly (better than mixed national). Farm income prospects unchanged. Compared to national trends, Chicago showed relative strength in financial conditions, construction, and consumer spending while manufacturing weakness aligned with broader trends.",

No contradictions here.\n- It also adds some extra Chicago items (nonbusiness contacts no change, business spending declined slightly), which do not contradict the expected answer.\n- On comparison to national trends: \n  * It notes overall activity “flat/little changed” similar to some districts—consistent with the idea of little change on balance.\n  * It explicitly states consumer spending increased modestly and contrasts that with declines elsewhere, which is aligned with the ground truth that Chicago was stronger on consumer spending than the national picture.\n  * It states construction/real estate increased slightly and contrasts that with declines/flat elsewhere, matching the idea that Chicago is relatively stronger there.\n  * It describes manufacturing as declining modestly and contrasts that with growth in some districts; while more granular than the ground truth, it is not contradictory to “national challenging conditions.”\n  * It notes wages and prices at modest/moderate increases, aligning with national modest-to-moderate language.\n  * It highlights financial conditions “loosened slightly” and remarks that comparable detail is not widely given for other districts, implicitly indicating a distinct/stronger condition—compatible with the expected relative-strength statement.\n  * It notes farm income prospects unchanged and compares to other districts’ mixed conditions, which matches the expected description of unchanged prospects.\n- There are no factual contradictions with the expected summary; the system answer is more detailed but preserves all the key relationships described in the expected answer.\n\nBecause: (a) all key indicators and their directions are present and correct, and (b) the comparative characterization (relative strength in consumer spending, construction/real estate, and financial conditions; manufacturing weakness in line with broader challenges) is correctly reflected, the system answer fully matches and expands on the expected answer without introducing errors.",

Prices rose at a moderate pace, and contacts reported they anticipate raising selling prices in 2026 at a slightly faster pace than this year.
