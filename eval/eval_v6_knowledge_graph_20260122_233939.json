      "system_answer": "Mid‑August to September 2025\n- Over the reporting period from **mid‑August through September 2025**, overall economic activity in the **Twelfth District (San Francisco)** **edged down slightly**.\n- **Employment**: Firms generally kept staffing levels steady, so overall employment was **little changed** during this time.\n- **Wages and prices**: \n  - **Wages** increased **slightly**.\n  - **Prices** rose **modestly**, indicating mild inflationary pressure.\n\nSectoral changes over this period\n- **Retail trade**: \n  - Activity **decreased somewhat** between mid‑August and late September 2025, contributing to the slight overall decline in activity.  \n- **Residential real estate**:\n  - Also **decreased somewhat** over this same period, showing a cooling in housing market activity.\n- **Commercial real estate**:\n  - Activity was **largely unchanged** from mid‑August through September 2025.\n- **Manufacturing**:\n  - Conditions were **largely stable/unchanged** during the period.\n- **Lending/financial activity**:\n  - **Largely unchanged**, indicating no major tightening or expansion of credit compared with the prior period.\n- **Agriculture and resource‑related sectors**:\n  - **Weakened modestly/slightly** over the mid‑August to September 2025 interval.\n- **Consumer and business services**:\n  - Showed **mixed conditions** during this time, with no clear, uniform direction of change across all services.\n- **Small businesses and community support organizations**:\n  - Experienced **modest weakening** over this period, reflecting some deterioration in demand and financial conditions.\n\nChange in outlook relative to the prior period\n- Compared with the **prior reporting period** (the weeks before mid‑August 2025), contacts in the Twelfth District reported that:\n  - The **overall economic outlook deteriorated somewhat** by late September 2025.\n  - This deterioration reflects the combination of: a slight overall decline in economic activity, modest weakening in agriculture/resource sectors, retail and residential real estate softness, and pressures felt by small businesses and community organizations.\n\nIn summary, from **mid‑August to the end of September 2025**, the Twelfth District saw a **slight downward shift** in overall economic activity, with some sectors (retail, residential real estate, agriculture, small businesses, community organizations) softening, while others (manufacturing, lending, commercial real estate, employment) remained broadly stable, and the **forward-looking outlook became somewhat more pessimistic** than in the preceding period.

      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Overall economic activity in the Twelfth District edged down slightly.\n2) Activity in retail trade either decreased or remained stable.\n3) Activity in agriculture either decreased or remained stable.\n4) Activity in residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.\n\nComparison with system answer:\n- The system explicitly states that overall economic activity \"edged down slightly\" in the Twelfth District over the period → matches fact (1).\n- Retail trade: system says activity \"decreased somewhat\" → consistent with \"either decreased or remained stable\" → matches fact (2).\n- Agriculture: system says agriculture and resource‑related sectors \"weakened modestly/slightly\" → consistent with \"either decreased or remained stable\" → matches fact (3).\n- Residential real estate: system says it \"also decreased somewhat\" → consistent with \"either decreased or remained stable\" → matches fact (4).\n- The rest of the answer adds sectoral detail and outlook information, but nothing contradicts the ground truth.\n\nAll key facts are present and accurate; no contradictions or factual errors relative to the expected answer. Additional details are aligned with and elaborative of the expected content, not in conflict with it.\n\nVerdict: correct.",
