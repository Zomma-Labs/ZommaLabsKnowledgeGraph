However, the evidence does **not** provide an explicit statement that Alphabet reached $3 trillion exactly on September 15, 2025\u2014only that a Reuters article about Alphabet and its $3 trillion valuation is dated that day. Therefore, we can say the milestone occurred *by* September 15, 2025, but the precise date is not definitively stated in the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Supporting Evidence\n\n- The knowledge graph encodes that Alphabet is the **\u201cfourth company to reach a $3 trillion market valuation.\u201d** This relationship is attached to Alphabet Inc. through edges such as `UNKNOWN \u2192 fourth company to reach a $3 trillion market valuation`.

[DOC: kg_alphabet, CHUNK: 1]\n\nThese connections collectively indicate that by the time of the **Reuters article dated September 15, 2025**, Alphabet was recognized as having reached a $3 trillion market valuation, and that it was the **fourth** company to do so. [DOC: kg_alphabet, CHUNK: 1]\n\n---\n\n### Caveats\n\n- The evidence does **not** contain the exact sentence of the Reuters or CNBC articles; it only records:\n  - The **fact** that Alphabet is the \u201cfourth company to reach a $3 trillion market valuation.\u201d [DOC: kg_alphabet, CHUNK: 1]  \n  - The **date** of a related Reuters article: **September 15, 2025**.

      "answer": "Based on the available evidence, I cannot answer this question because there are **no retrievable text chunks** that state Alphabet\u2019s ranking among the world\u2019s largest technology companies by revenue.\n\n1. **What the evidence contains**\n\n- The knowledge graph\u2019s neighbor exploration suggests structural links indicating that Alphabet is:\n  - \u201cranked behind\u201d Apple and Amazon, and\n  - associated with the phrase \u201cworld's third-largest technology company by revenue,\u201d  \n  and that it was ranked in the **Global 2000 (World\u2019s Largest Public Companies)** in 2023. However, when these relationships were queried for actual supporting text, **no source documents or chunks were returned**.\n\n  > \u201cThe tool returned, for every one of these:  \n  > `NO EVIDENCE FOUND: No source document connects 'Alphabet Inc.' to '<target>' via [<edge_type>]. This specific relationship has no supporting evidence in the graph.`\u201d  \n  > \u201cThat means: although the neighbor exploration hints that the graph *knows about* Alphabet being ranked behind Apple and Amazon, being \u2018world\u2019s third-largest technology company by revenue,\u2019 and being ranked in the Global 2000, the graph does **not** have any retrievable text chunks (citations) attached to those specific edges.\u201d  \n\n2. **Why this is insufficient**\n\n- The instructions require that **every factual claim** be supported by a specific cited chunk. Here, there are:\n  - **No 10\u2011K excerpts**\n  - **No Global 2000 ranking excerpts**\n  - **No article or report text** explicitly stating Alphabet\u2019s rank by revenue  \n\n  The summary explicitly concludes:\n\n  > \u201cI found **no retrievable chunks** (no text excerpts from source documents) that explicitly state Alphabet\u2019s ranking among the world\u2019s largest technology companies by revenue.\u201d  \n\n3. **Caveats**\n\n- The graph\u2019s structure strongly suggests that Alphabet may be referred to as the \u201cworld's third-largest technology company by revenue\u201d and that it is ranked behind Apple and Amazon, but since there are **no associated text chunks**, I cannot quote or formally rely on this under the given rules.\n- The evidence also indicates a connection to the Global 2000 list, but again *without* any supporting excerpt showing the actual rank or confirming that ranking is specifically \u201cby revenue.\u201d\n\n4. **Confidence**\n\n- Confidence is **low**, not because the underlying fact is necessarily wrong, but because the dataset provided contains **no citable evidence** from which I am allowed to derive or confirm Alphabet\u2019s ranking.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected factual answer is that Alphabet is the third-largest technology company by revenue, after Amazon and Apple. Instead of providing this, the agent claims it cannot answer due to lack of citable evidence. In this evaluation setting, we judge against the expected factual answer, not the agent\u2019s citation constraints, so the agent\u2019s response is considered incorrect.",

      "question": "When did Alphabet conduct a stock split?",
      "expected": "Mid-2022",
      "answer": "Direct Answer  \nBased on the available evidence, I cannot state when Alphabet conducted a stock split. The collected documents and graph relations identify where such information is likely recorded (e.g., SEC filings and finance portals), but they do not contain any explicit dates or descriptions of a stock split.\n\nSupporting Evidence  \n1. The evidence ties Alphabet Inc. to ticker symbols and finance sites that typically include stock-split history, but without surfacing the actual split data:\n\n- Alphabet Inc. is linked to the ticker symbol GOOG and a Yahoo Finance page (\u201cAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) Stock Major Holders\u201d), which is a type of source that often includes stock split history, but no split details are actually quoted in the evidence:  \n  \u201cAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) Stock Major Holders - Yahoo Finance\u201d is referenced as a source related to GOOG. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 7983f8b3-f524-435d-ba55-c3de17062df2]\n\n- There is a Yahoo Finance summary page \u201cGoogl : Summary For Alphabet Inc\u201d, associated with Alphabet Inc., but again, the content of that page (including any stock split section) is not provided:  \n  The graph notes this page is \u201cIS_SUMMARY_FOR \u2192 alphabet inc.\u201d, but no text from the page is included. [DOC: 2015-10-02, CHUNK: not explicitly numbered in summary; described under section 5]\n\n- Alphabet Inc. (Class A) is linked to quote/markets pages on Google Finance, Nasdaq, and Reuters, which typically record split history, but no actual split information is extracted in the chunks:  \n  The entity \u201cAlphabet Inc. (Class A)\u201d has edges such as \u201cHAS_QUOTE_PAGE \u2192 Google Finance\u201d, \u201cIS_REFERENCED_WITH \u2192 nasdaq\u201d, and \u201cHAS_MARKETS_PAGE \u2192 Reuters\u201d. [DOC: 2015-10-02, CHUNK: referenced in section 4 of the summary]\n\n2. The evidence confirms the existence of SEC filings that would normally disclose stock splits, but no split details from within those filings are included:\n\n- Alphabet Inc. 2021 Annual Form 10-K Report is identified as a report for Alphabet and is hosted on Alphabet\u2019s site and archived, but the content mentioning any stock split is not part of the provided chunks:  \n  Edges show \u201cIS_A_REPORT \u2192 alphabet inc.\u201d and that it is an Annual Form 10-K Report, but no \u201cMENTIONS_STOCK_SPLIT\u201d text is present. [DOC: Alphabet Inc. 2021 Form 10\u2011K, CHUNK: described under section 2]\n\n- Alphabet Inc. 2023 Annual Form 10-K Report is similarly identified and hosted by the SEC, but again without any extracted stock split discussion:  \n  \u201cIS_HOSTED_BY \u2192 u.s. securities and exchange commission\u201d with a primary SEC link, but no stock split language surfaced. [DOC: Alphabet Inc. 2023 Form 10\u2011K, CHUNK: described under section 3]\n\n3. Other related corporate filings and entities are surfaced, but they concern restructuring rather than confirmed splits:\n\n- The graph points to a Google Inc. Form 8\u2011K from August 10, 2015, associated with the reorganization into Alphabet Inc.; however, the evidence does not label this as describing a stock split or provide any detail on share split dates:  \n  Edges include \u201cCONCERNS \u2190 \u2018Google Inc. Filing With The Sec, Form 8-K\u2019 | August 10, 2015\u201d and relationships about becoming a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., but no explicit stock split mention. [DOC: 2015-10-02, CHUNK: described under section 9]\n\nCaveats  \n- The evidence clearly identifies authoritative sources (SEC 10\u2011K reports, Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, Nasdaq, Reuters) that typically list stock split dates, but the actual text from those sources regarding splits is not part of the provided chunks.  \n- No chunk in the evidence contains phrases like \u201cstock split\u201d, \u201ctwo\u2011for\u2011one split\u201d, \u201ceffective on\u201d, or specific split dates for Alphabet/GOOG/GOOGL.  \n- Because the instructions require relying only on the supplied evidence, I cannot use outside knowledge or infer specific dates from common market knowledge.\n\nConfidence  \nLow. The graph points to where stock split information almost certainly exists (e.g., SEC filings and financial websites), but without any explicit split-related text or dates in the provided evidence, I cannot answer when Alphabet conducted a stock split.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is that Alphabet conducted its stock split in mid-2022. The agent instead claimed it could not state when the stock split occurred and gave no timing at all. This directly contradicts the expected answer, so the response is incorrect.",
