    "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
    "expected": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
    "graphrag_answer": "Economic activity in the Twelfth District (San Francisco) has faced significant challenges, particularly for small businesses and community support organizations. Reports indicate that small businesses are experiencing reduced demand, leading to increased loan delinquencies, business closures, and a depletion of savings. Specifically, small businesses have seen a rise in loan delinquencies, reflecting their difficulties in meeting debt obligations as revenues decline, and many are reducing operating hours to cope with financial strain (Data: Entities 1219, 554; Relationships 1053, 1054).\n\nCommunity support organizations are also under severe stress, facing increased demand for services while experiencing funding cuts, which limit their ability to assist vulnerable populations (Data: Entities 1218, 1301, 1302; Relationships 1051, 1052). This situation creates a feedback loop where the struggles of small businesses increase the demand for social support, while the financial constraints on community organizations hinder their capacity to provide necessary assistance.\n\nOverall, the economic conditions in the Twelfth District are characterized by heightened vulnerability among small businesses and community support organizations, threatening both economic and social stability in the region (Data: Entities 1218, 1219; Relationships 1050).",

    "expected": "Economic activity changed little on balance since the previous report, with three Districts reporting slight to modest growth in activity, five reporting no change, and four noting a slight softening.",
    "graphrag_answer": "According to the October 2025 Beige Book, overall economic activity showed signs of a slight decline, particularly within the Twelfth District, where there were modest decreases in production, trade, and consumption. This decline is attributed to significant downside risks, including the potential impact of a government shutdown, which could disrupt federal operations and undermine consumer and business confidence. Additionally, while some regions reported stability or slight increases in employment, the overall sentiment indicated cautious optimism about future economic conditions, with expectations of modest growth in certain sectors despite current challenges.",

Additionally, there is softening demand for certain refined products and retail segments, contributing to the overall economic challenges in the region.\n\n2. **Twelfth District**: Small businesses are facing significant financial strain, characterized by increased loan delinquencies, business closures, and reduced operating hours.

    "question": "How did the Second District (New York) economy perform?",
    "expected": "Economic activity in the Second District continued to decline slightly. Employment held steady, and wage growth remained modest. The pace of price increases remained elevated but was little changed.",
    "graphrag_answer": "The Second District (New York) economy has shown resilience and modest growth, particularly in the retail sector. Department stores have experienced strengthening sales, especially in apparel, cosmetics, and fragrances, driven by robust spending patterns from mid- to upper-income consumers. This demographic has been crucial in sustaining retail growth, reflecting their financial stability and purchasing power.\n\nConsumer spending overall has increased modestly, with department stores benefiting from this trend, indicating a direct link between their sales and broader consumer behavior. The retail sector, particularly in Manhattan, has seen strong demand for retail space, declining vacancy rates, and stable or modestly increasing rents, especially in the luxury market.\n\nHowever, the construction sector faces challenges, with declining activity and heightened competition, while the industrial sector has experienced muted activity due to economic uncertainties.

    "question": "What happened to overall consumer spending in the October 2025 report?",
    "expected": "Overall consumer spending, particularly on retail goods, inched down in recent weeks.",
    "graphrag_answer": "In the October 2025 Beige Book report, overall consumer spending showed regional variations, with modest increases in the Second and Fifth Districts, while the Cleveland and Sixth Districts experienced slight declines. This indicates that while consumer spending remained robust in some areas, there were pockets of caution and economic uncertainty affecting overall trends. The report emphasized that consumer spending is a critical driver of economic activity, influenced by factors such as credit usage and income segmentation among households. Specifically, increased reliance on credit, particularly among middle-income consumers, was noted as a key factor in maintaining spending levels despite economic pressures (Data: Entities (9); Relationships (200, 241, 847, +more)).",
