Google\u2019s stock was then converted to Alphabet\u2019s stock\u2026 The restructuring process was completed on October 2, 2015. Alphabet retains Google Inc.'s stock price history and continues to trade under Google Inc.'s [listing].\u201d  \n  [DOC: 8ee89ac7-b6c5-4d88-8d6e-94739ec5f913, CHUNK: 8ee89ac7-b6c5-4d88-8d6e-94739ec5f913]\n\n5. **Scale, listings, and subsidiaries**\n\n- Alphabet is described as \u201cthe world\u2019s third-largest technology company by revenue, after Amazon and Apple, [and] the largest technology company by profit.\u201d It is \u201clisted on the large-cap section of the Nasdaq\u201d and is part of the \u201cS&P 500 and Nasdaq-100.\u201d  \n  [DOC: 0eaf9248-9d5a-4bd3-83e6-85afa7861569, CHUNK: 0eaf9248-9d5a-4bd3-83e6-85afa7861569]\n\n- Key financial and scale metrics given include: revenue of US$350.02 billion in 2024, operating income of US$112.39 billion in 2024, net income of US$100.12 billion in 2024, total assets of US$450.26 billion in 2024, total equity of US$325.08 billion in 2024, and 190,167 employees as of September 2025.  \n  [DOC: 0eaf9248-9d5a-4bd3-83e6-85afa7861569, CHUNK: 0eaf9248-9d5a-4bd3-83e6-85afa7861569]\n\n- Listed subsidiaries include: Calico, CapitalG, Google, Google Fiber, GV, Isomorphic Labs, Verily, Waymo, and Wing.  \n  [DOC: 0eaf9248-9d5a-4bd3-83e6-85afa7861569, CHUNK: 0eaf9248-9d5a-4bd3-83e6-85afa7861569]\n\n---\n\n### Caveats\n\n- The evidence does not provide a full, detailed business description for each subsidiary, only a list of several major ones.

      "question": "Who are the founders of Google (and later Alphabet)?",
      "expected": "Larry Page and Sergey Brin",
      "answer": "1. **Direct Answer**\n\nThe founders of Google, and later its parent company Alphabet, are **Larry Page** and **Sergey Brin**.  \n\nAlphabet\u2019s own company information lists its founders as \u201cLarry Page, Sergey Brin.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 98eacbc2-73b0-498e-9a02-446b4cd51c23]\n\n2. **Supporting Evidence**\n\n- The Alphabet company infobox explicitly states:\n\n  > \u201cFounded October 2, 2015  \n  > **Founders  \n  > Larry Page  \n  > Sergey Brin**\u201d  \n  [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 98eacbc2-73b0-498e-9a02-446b4cd51c23]\n\n- Relationship facts derived from the same Alphabet article confirm:\n\n  > \u201cFact: Sergey Brin is a founder of Alphabet.  \n  > Fact: Larry Page is a founder of Alphabet.\u201d  \n\n- Google is described as Alphabet\u2019s core business and original entity:\n\n  > \u201cSubsidiary: **Google**  \n  > Business: Internet services, **largest subsidiary and prior corporate entity name**\u201d  \n  [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 550c17e4-2255-48d0-83d8-78af555b42f1]\n\n  and:\n\n  > \u201cThe original motto was retained in the code of conduct of **Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet**.\u201d  \n  [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: c2f1f884-cf13-46ca-89c7-8953e8446c5c]\n\n- Additional relationship facts tie Page and Brin together as the founding duo controlling Alphabet:\n\n  > \u201cFact: Page transitioned to the role of running Alphabet, **along with co\u2011founder Sergey Brin**.  \n  > Fact: Founders **Larry Page and Sergey Brin** announced their resignation from their executive posts in December 2019.  \n  > Fact: Page and Brin jointly retained majority voting control on the Board of Directors.\u201d\n\nThese show that the same two individuals\u2014Larry Page and Sergey Brin\u2014are recognized as the founders at the Alphabet level, with Google as the \u201cprior corporate entity name,\u201d supporting that they are the founders of \u201cGoogle (and later Alphabet).\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 98eacbc2-73b0-498e-9a02-446b4cd51c23; DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 550c17e4-2255-48d0-83d8-78af555b42f1]\n\n3. **Caveats**\n\n- The evidence explicitly lists the founders of Alphabet (Larry Page and Sergey Brin) and describes Google as Alphabet\u2019s largest subsidiary and prior corporate entity name. It does **not** contain a separate, explicit \u201cFounders: \u2026\u201d field for Google itself. Instead, the linkage that Page and Brin also founded Google is inferred from:\n  - Alphabet\u2019s founders being Page and Brin, and  \n  - Google being the \u201cprior corporate entity name\u201d and core subsidiary of Alphabet.  \n  [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 98eacbc2-73b0-498e-9a02-446b4cd51c23; DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 550c17e4-2255-48d0-83d8-78af555b42f1]\n\n4. **Confidence**\n\nHigh confidence that **Larry Page and Sergey Brin** are the founders of Alphabet, and, via the \u201cprior corporate entity name\u201d and subsidiary relationship, that these are the same founders associated with Google.",

[DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 7f98ed2a-a6fd-4e80-8661-68b974c1305b].  \n- Under corporate identity, it states: \u201cAlphabet uses the domain abc.xyz (https://abc.xyz) with the .xyz top-level domain (TLD)\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: c2f1f884-cf13-46ca-89c7-8953e8446c5c].  \n- The same corporate identity section also notes that Alphabet does **not** own alphabet.com or abc.com, clarifying that those domains belong to other companies [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: c2f1f884-cf13-46ca-89c7-8953e8446c5c].  \n- A reference to Alphabet\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K is hosted at a URL on `abc.xyz` (https://abc.xyz/investor/\u2026), indicating that Alphabet uses this domain for investor materials [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 04ca5043-f40a-4e53-a2f3-bf7dafdce097].\n\n3. **Caveats**\n\n- The evidence confirms that `abc.xyz` is the official website and domain used by Alphabet Inc.; it does not list every possible domain Alphabet might control, only clarifies that `alphabet.com` and `abc.com` are not owned by Alphabet [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: c2f1f884-cf13-46ca-89c7-8953e8446c5c].\n\n4. **Confidence**\n\n- **High confidence**: multiple independent chunks explicitly identify `abc.xyz` as Alphabet\u2019s official website and domain.",

[DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 98eacbc2-73b0-498e-9a02-446b4cd51c23]  \n- The relationship graph explicitly encodes that Alphabet \u201cHOLDS_ROLE_OF_PRESIDENT_AND_CHIEF_INVESTMENT_OFFICER\u201d with Ruth Porat, and that Ruth Porat \u201cHOLDS_ROLE_OF_PRESIDENT_AND_CHIEF_INVESTMENT_OFFICER\u201d at Alphabet Inc.

The agent gives a more specific date, 'December 3, 2019,' which is consistent with and contained within December 2019, so the time frame is correct. However, because the evaluation rubric is keyed to the exact expected answer, the agent's added specificity may be seen as going beyond what was required, but it is not factually wrong.

[DOC: N/A, CHUNK: d2ccb3fd-dc8f-4acb-a8fd-2571627e735f]\n\n---\n\n**Supporting Evidence**\n\n- The Alphabet history section states:  \n  \u201cOn **December 3, 2019**, Page and Brin jointly announced that they would step down from their respective roles\u2026 **Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, assumed the CEO role at Alphabet** while retaining the same at Google.\u201d  \n  [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: d2ccb3fd-dc8f-4acb-a8fd-2571627e735f]\n\n- A referenced article notes:  \n  \u201cLauren Feiner (December 3, 2019). \u2018Larry Page steps down as CEO of Alphabet, **Sundar Pichai to take over**\u2019\u2026\u201d  \n  [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 614a676a-87bd-4a49-a9a9-31c698e1bfe2]\n\nThese together indicate that the transition to Pichai as CEO of Alphabet occurred on December 3, 2019.\n\n---\n\n**Caveats**\n\n- The evidence clearly gives the announcement date (December 3, 2019) and states that Pichai \u201cassumed the CEO role at Alphabet\u201d on that date; it does not separately discuss any later \u201ceffective\u201d date, so the answer is based on the documented assumption date.

It does not label one single phrase as \u201cthe\u201d primary reason, so identifying the overarching theme (\u201cmake the core Google business cleaner and more accountable, with better transparency/oversight\u201d) involves interpreting the most emphasized points.\n\n4. **Confidence**\n\nHigh confidence, because the cited chunks directly attribute these reasons to the establishment of Alphabet and to Larry Page\u2019s announcement.",

[Relationship 2 & 3 in the summary tied to DOC: 278e2c18-d19f-4910-b9ee-d1fab2fa61db]  \n- Neighbor information for Alphabet indicates it \u201cwas modeled on \u2192 Berkshire Hathaway,\u201d consistent with the above. (Neighbor hint noted in the search summary associated with DOC: 278e2c18-d19f-4910-b9ee-d1fab2fa61db)\n\n3. **Caveats**\n\n- The documents referenced in the summary do not show the full underlying articles or direct quotes naming \u201cBerkshire Hathaway,\u201d but the knowledge graph relationships explicitly map \u201cHathaway\u201d to Berkshire Hathaway as the inspiration.\n- Details on the exact date, venue, or full context of Eric Schmidt\u2019s remarks are not included in the provided chunks.\n\n4. **Confidence**\n\nI have **high confidence** in this answer, as multiple independent relationships in the evidence explicitly identify **Berkshire Hathaway** as the company whose management/holding\u2011company structure inspired Alphabet\u2019s organizational design.",

      "answer": "Based on the available evidence, I cannot answer this question because none of the collected chunks mention Berkshire Hathaway or identify who revealed that Berkshire Hathaway inspired Alphabet\u2019s structure.\n\nThe evidence only covers:\n\n- That Larry Page publicly \u201cexplained the new Alphabet\u201d in media coverage of the restructuring [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 7b59ffd4-9c52-401f-b9f3-d86c3d6a41ce].  \n- That Google would become part of a new holding company called Alphabet [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 184363b9-c4a6-4c93-b857-5cf6c47f3448].  \n- That Google Inc. was initially structured as the owner of Alphabet before becoming its subsidiary [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 8ee89ac7-b6c5-4d88-8d6e-94739ec5f913].  \n- That Alphabet was created to make the core Google business \u201ccleaner and more accountable\u201d and to give greater autonomy to other group companies [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 8fb8d0cf-58e4-49a4-97ef-bf4fb701f14a].  \n- That Alphabet was created to restructure Google by moving subsidiaries into Alphabet and narrowing Google\u2019s scope, with Page clarifying that companies \u201cpretty far afield\u201d of main internet products would sit in Alphabet [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: bf5f8090-606d-41e0-b19d-256f7c4812c1].  \n- Various media references noting the holding-company structure and the \u201cGoogle is now Alphabet\u201d change [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: c23fe7d1-f564-43d0-8721-520d9e3ba3bb; DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 7fdf6a17-6392-4eee-b518-67f53b560026; DOC: N/A, CHUNK: f9af2621-47e8-4df8-b338-1e0e015210f0].\n\nNone of these chunks state that Alphabet\u2019s structure was inspired by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, nor do they name any person (Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Eric Schmidt, or anyone else) as having revealed such an inspiration.\n\nCaveats:  \n- The graph metadata alludes to relationships involving Berkshire Hathaway and Alphabet at the structural level, but there are no textual chunks returned that document who revealed this or even that Berkshire Hathaway was an inspiration. Without text, I cannot make a sourced claim.\n\nConfidence:  \n- Low. The answer is \u201cunknown from this evidence\u201d because the necessary fact simply does not appear in any retrieved chunk.",

Since the user asked for ALL evidence that *could help* answer who revealed the inspiration, the relevant chunks are (1) the Larry Page \"explained\" reference and (2) all chunks about Alphabet's restructuring/holding-company design that might mention Berkshire or Buffett in full text (even though the summary facts shown don't). These chunks are: 7b59ffd4-9c52-401f-b9f3-d86c3d6a41ce, 184363b9-c4a6-4c93-b857-5cf6c47f3448, 8ee89ac7-b6c5-4d88-8d6e-94739ec5f913, 8fb8d0cf-58e4-49a4-97ef-bf4fb701f14a, bf5f8090-606d-41e0-b19d-256f7c4812c1, c23fe7d1-f564-43d0-8721-520d9e3ba3bb, 7fdf6a17-6392-4eee-b518-67f53b560026, f9af2621-47e8-4df8-b338-1e0e015210f0. I should list these chunks verbatim as the complete set of evidence the graph has that is even tangentially about Alphabet's structure and its announcement, and explicitly note that the graph has no chunk that directly states who revealed the Berkshire inspiration."

      "answer": "1. **Direct Answer**\n\nBased on the available evidence, the major subsidiaries of Alphabet mentioned in the article are:\n\n- **Google** (largest subsidiary)  \n- **Waymo**  \n- **Verily**  \n- **Google Fiber**  \n- **GV (Google Ventures)**\n\n2. **Supporting Evidence**\n\n- A table under \u201cAlphabet > Structure\u201d explicitly lists **Google** as a subsidiary of Alphabet and notes it is the \u201clargest subsidiary and prior corporate entity name\u201d with Sundar Pichai as executive leader. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 550c17e4-2255-48d0-83d8-78af555b42f1]\n\n- Relationship facts in the graph state that **Google is a subsidiary and the largest subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.** and that **subsidiaries were transferred from Google to Alphabet** as part of a restructuring. These facts also note that Alphabet is the parent of a diverse set of subsidiaries. (Graph relationship facts summarized in the search results)\n\n- Neighbor exploration for **Alphabet Inc.** lists edges marked `HAS_SUBSIDIARY` to:\n  - **Google**  \n  - **Waymo**  \n  - **Verily**  \n  - **Google Fiber**  \n  and an `IS_SUBSIDIARY_OF` edge from **GV** to Alphabet, indicating these entities are treated in the graph as Alphabet subsidiaries mentioned in the underlying article. (Neighbor listing for Alphabet Inc. in the search summary)\n\n3. **Caveats**\n\n- Only **Google** is supported by a concrete text chunk explicitly labeling it as an Alphabet subsidiary and the largest subsidiary. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 550c17e4-2255-48d0-83d8-78af555b42f1]\n\n- For **Waymo, Verily, Google Fiber, and GV**, the evidence comes from graph neighbor edges (`HAS_SUBSIDIARY` / `IS_SUBSIDIARY_OF`), not from full text chunks. The system reports no retrievable chunks for those specific edges, so we cannot quote article text directly for them.\n\n- The evidence does not provide a ranked list of \u201cmajor\u201d subsidiaries; identifying them as \u201cmajor\u201d is inferred from their appearance as named subsidiaries in the graph\u2019s corporate-structure relationships, not from explicit wording in the article.\n\n4. **Confidence**\n\n- **High confidence** that **Google** is a major subsidiary of Alphabet and its largest subsidiary, as this is directly stated in the evidence. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 550c17e4-2255-48d0-83d8-78af555b42f1]\n\n- **Moderate confidence** that **Waymo, Verily, Google Fiber, and GV** are subsidiaries mentioned in the article, since they appear as `HAS_SUBSIDIARY` / `IS_SUBSIDIARY_OF` neighbors of Alphabet in the knowledge graph, but without directly viewable supporting text chunks.",

That chunk is clearly relevant as evidence of the timing of the announcement. Separate chunks talk about the 2015 reorganization into Alphabet, completion on October 2, 2015, and holding company structures; these provide contextual evidence around corporate reorganization but not the LLC date itself. The references chunk (TechCrunch article and SEC filing) are also relevant because they discuss the corporate reorganization that included the LLC change. The user asked to \"collect every chunk that might be relevant\" and to be thorough. From search_relationships plus get_chunks, we currently have 6 chunks: 1 main structural description with the LLC sentence; 2 history chunks about 2015 holding company reorg; 2 reference chunks (TechCrunch article, AOL article/SEC filing). All are arguably relevant because they describe reorganizations and the same set of corporate changes. To be extra thorough, we might also explore neighbors of \"Google\" and \"Alphabet Inc.\" with a hint like \"limited liability company\", \"reorganization\", or \"LLC\" to see if there are any other related chunks (e.g., SEC documents, other descriptions). Then we should collect all chunks found that mention reorganization, LLC, or the 2017 structural changes. After collecting, we should present them all verbatim as evidence, not interpret the answer, since the user only asked for evidence collection."

      "answer": "1. **Direct Answer**\n\nBased on the available evidence, the only subsidiary described as being merged back into Google is an **unnamed \u201cplaceholder subsidiary\u201d** that was created to own Alphabet during the 2015 restructuring. After it was created, **this newly formed placeholder subsidiary was merged with Google Inc.** [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 8ee89ac7-b6c5-4d88-8d6e-94739ec5f913].\n\nThe evidence does **not** identify any other specific subsidiaries that were merged back into Google.\n\n---\n\n2. **Supporting Evidence**\n\nThe relevant evidence states:\n\n> \u201cBefore it became a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google Inc. was first structured as the owner of Alphabet. The roles were reversed after **a placeholder subsidiary was created for the ownership of Alphabet, at which point the newly formed subsidiary was merged with Google**. Google's stock was then converted to Alphabet's stock.\u201d  \n> [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 8ee89ac7-b6c5-4d88-8d6e-94739ec5f913]\n\nThis is the only chunk in the evidence that explicitly describes a subsidiary \u201cbeing merged with\u201d Google Inc., and it refers only to this **placeholder subsidiary**, without giving it a specific name [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 8ee89ac7-b6c5-4d88-8d6e-94739ec5f913].\n\nOther related evidence describes the broader restructuring in the opposite direction\u2014subsidiaries moving from Google to Alphabet and Google becoming a subsidiary of Alphabet\u2014but does not mention any other subsidiaries being merged back into Google [DOC: bf5f8090-606d-41e0-b19d-256f7c4812c1; DOC: 550c17e4-2255-48d0-83d8-78af555b42f1; DOC: c2f1f884-cf13-46ca-89c7-8953e8446c5c].\n\n---\n\n3. **Caveats**\n\n- The evidence refers to this entity only as a **\u201cplaceholder subsidiary\u201d** and does not provide its legal name or other identifying details [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 8ee89ac7-b6c5-4d88-8d6e-94739ec5f913].\n- The available evidence does **not** list any additional subsidiaries that were merged back into Google. It is possible that other such transactions occurred, but they are not described in the provided material.\n- Most other restructuring information in the evidence concerns subsidiaries being moved from Google to Alphabet, not into Google [DOC: bf5f8090-606d-41e0-b19d-256f7c4812c1].\n\n---\n\n4. **Confidence**\n\nConfidence is **medium**: the specific restructuring step involving the \u201cplaceholder subsidiary\u201d being merged with Google is clearly described, but the evidence set is limited and does not claim to be a complete list of all mergers involving Google.",

[DOC: 36c336d2-edcd-4cf3-bf04-c4f94d452602]\n\n3. **Caveats**\n\n- The evidence provides a single snapshot of institutional ownership with approximate percentages; it does not specify the date of this data or whether it is current. [DOC: 36c336d2-edcd-4cf3-bf04-c4f94d452602]  \n- External links to sources like SEC filings, Reuters, and LittleSis are mentioned, but their contents are not included in the evidence, so no additional verification or updates can be incorporated. [DOC: 7f98ed2a-a6fd-4e80-8661-68b974c1305b]\n\n4. **Confidence**\n\nConfidence is **moderate**: the evidence clearly lists major institutional shareholders and their stakes, but lack of a timestamp and inability to cross-check against the linked external sources limits certainty about how current this ownership breakdown is.",

[DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 7e49c347-cd14-47be-abc9-4f72c8822bc4]\n\n3. **Caveats**\n\n- The evidence provided only includes a reference that Alphabet replaced Google\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d with \u201cDo the right thing\u201d and treats this as Alphabet\u2019s guiding phrase; it does not explicitly label it as \u201cofficial motto\u201d or discuss any other motto or slogan Alphabet might use. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 7e49c347-cd14-47be-abc9-4f72c8822bc4]  \n- No additional chunks in the evidence discuss alternative or updated mottos for Alphabet.\n\n4. **Confidence**\n\n- **Moderate to high confidence** that \u201cDo the right thing\u201d functions as Alphabet\u2019s company motto, as it is explicitly described as replacing Google\u2019s prior slogan and is tied to Alphabet\u2019s code of conduct.

      "question": "What percentage of Alphabet's 2017 revenues came from performance and brand advertising?",
      "expected": "86%",
      "answer": "Based on the available evidence, I cannot answer this question because the evidence does not include any breakdown of Alphabet\u2019s 2017 revenues by category, including \u201cperformance and brand advertising.\u201d\n\n1. **What the evidence does contain**\n\n- There is a generic \u201cFinances\u201d section for Alphabet, but it does not include any revenue composition or advertising\u2011type breakdowns. It only notes that it summarizes key trends without providing details. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 7297f32f-1233-4596-aad5-72d89e80768d]\n\n- One chunk provides high\u2011level financial figures (revenue, net income, total assets, employees) for 2020\u20132024, but not for 2017, and it has no mention of performance vs. brand advertising or revenue percentages by line of business. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: a3742b6b-cca4-4a95-94d0-8bba12c819f2]\n\n- The references list includes:\n  - Alphabet\u2019s 2024 Form 10\u2011K (linked externally, but with no text from it in the evidence). [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 9fbcf0d8-2783-4801-b87a-8ed007519a3a]  \n  - An \u201cAnnual Report 2016\u201d PDF (again, only as an external link; its contents are not present). [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 1a0f36b0-17e1-45c4-b16d-601483c25e7c]\n\n- The search summary notes that there are semantic hints that:\n  - Alphabet reported total revenue of US$110,855 million in 2017,\n  - issued an \u201cAnnualReport 2017\u201d (10\u2011K PDF), and\n  - reported net income of US$12,662 million in 2017,  \n  but these items have no accessible text chunks, so no segment\u2011level revenue breakdowns or percentages are available.\n\n2. **What is missing**\n\n- There is no chunk that:\n  - defines or lists \u201cperformance advertising\u201d or \u201cbrand advertising\u201d as revenue categories for 2017, or\n  - states the share or percentage of 2017 total revenues attributable to these categories, either separately or combined.\n\n- Although the 2017 10\u2011K / Annual Report is referenced in the search summary, its text is not part of the evidence, so I cannot quote or derive any percentages from it.\n\n3. **Caveats**\n\n- To obtain the exact percentage of 2017 revenues from performance and brand advertising, one would need to consult the full 2017 Form 10\u2011K or Alphabet\u2019s 2017 annual report directly outside this evidence set (e.g., via the SEC or Alphabet\u2019s investor relations site). Those documents are only referenced, not included, in the current evidence.\n\n4. **Confidence**\n\n- Confidence is high that the answer cannot be derived from the provided evidence, because every accessible chunk has been checked and none contain a 2017 revenue breakdown by performance vs. brand advertising.",

      "answer": "1. **Direct Answer**\n\nThe Uber\u2013Waymo lawsuit was settled when Uber agreed to give Waymo (Alphabet\u2019s self\u2011driving car unit) an equity stake of **0.34% in Uber**, which was valued at about **$245 million** based on Uber\u2019s early\u20112018 valuation. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 15fae6fb-a5da-437d-ac19-0ffac8433a57]  \n\nThis settlement resolved Alphabet/Waymo\u2019s 2017 lawsuit accusing Uber of using self\u2011driving technology based on **14,000 proprietary Waymo documents** allegedly stolen by a former Waymo engineer.

The agent explicitly notes that non-monetary terms like technology restrictions are not described and does not mention any agreement by Uber not to use the technology.

Neighbor exploration and relationship search did not surface any additional distinct chunks about settlement terms beyond these. So the full set of relevant evidence for 'how was it settled' consists of those three chunks, plus potentially context about downloaded/stolen 14,000 documents and self-driving tech in dispute. However, the user only asked for evidence that could help answer how it was settled, so the settlement-term chunk and reference chunk are primary, with the lawsuit overview chunk as background. No further chunks are indicated by get_chunks_by_edge or search_relationships focused on settlement. Therefore, list all these chunks verbatim as the answer, clearly separated and labeled with their headers and edge descriptions."

[DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 36b9eb0e-8aaf-4080-8cca-9f55444509c5]\n\n- Another chunk under lawsuits and controversies confirms that the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet, though it does not itself give a date. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 185b45ce-540b-4a33-8dc7-ffd305bd8175]\n\n3. **Caveats**\n\n- The evidence only specifies the **year (2020)** when the DOJ filed the antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet.

[DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 11588e31-b7c8-41bc-b715-4b9cf840836c]\n\n---\n\n**Supporting Evidence**\n\n- The lawsuits and controversies section states:  \n  \u201cOn June 7, 2021, Alphabet Inc. announced it had settled an antitrust suit with the French Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence with a payment of **$27o million**. The settlement amounted to less than o.7% of Alphabet Inc.'s yearly earnings.\u201d  \n  [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 11588e31-b7c8-41bc-b715-4b9cf840836c]\n\n  The use of \u201c27o\u201d and \u201co.7%\u201d is clearly a scanning/character issue where \u201co\u201d is used instead of \u201c0\u201d, indicating the intended figures are **$270 million** and **0.7%**. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 11588e31-b7c8-41bc-b715-4b9cf840836c]\n\n- A related summary confirms this was one of multiple French antitrust actions:  \n  Alphabet has faced \u201cmultiple antitrust actions from the United States, France, and Japan\u2026\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 8fb8d0cf-58e4-49a4-97ef-bf4fb701f14a]\n\n---\n\n**Caveats**\n\n- The document is a secondary summary and not the original settlement or regulatory filing; the amount is taken from this summarized account. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 11588e31-b7c8-41bc-b715-4b9cf840836c]\n- The numeral \u201c27o\u201d relies on interpreting a likely OCR/typographical error as \u201c270,\u201d which is implied by the consistent substitution of \u201co\u201d for \u201c0\u201d in the same sentence. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 11588e31-b7c8-41bc-b715-4b9cf840836c]\n\n---\n\n**Confidence**\n\nGiven the explicit mention of the settlement payment (albeit with minor OCR artifacts) and its contextualization as less than 0.7% of yearly earnings, the answer is **highly supported** by the available evidence.",

      "question": "When did Alphabet announce its first-ever dividend payout?",
      "expected": "April 2024 (announced alongside the $2 trillion market cap milestone)",
      "answer": "1. **Direct Answer**\n\nBased on the available evidence, Alphabet\u2019s first-ever dividend payout was announced **sometime shortly before April 26, 2024**, but the exact announcement date is not specified in the evidence. The evidence only states that Alphabet\u2019s market valuation surge on April 26, 2024 \u201cfollows the announcement\u201d of this first dividend.\n\n2. **Supporting Evidence**\n\nThe relevant evidence says:\n\n- \u201cOn April 26, 2024, Alphabet surpassed a market valuation of $2 trillion for the first time. This surge follows the announcement of the company's first-ever dividend payout and a significant $70 billion stock buyback program.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 9f40a07b-f8c8-4b43-8f4d-a773ab206640]\n\nFrom this, we can conclude:\n- The dividend announcement happened **before** April 26, 2024, because the surge on that date \u201cfollows\u201d it. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 9f40a07b-f8c8-4b43-8f4d-a773ab206640]\n\n3. **Caveats**\n\n- The evidence does **not** provide the exact calendar date of the dividend announcement (e.g., \u201cApril X, 2024\u201d is not given).  \n- It only offers a relative time ordering (the announcement occurred before April 26, 2024) and links it causally to the market valuation surge. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 9f40a07b-f8c8-4b43-8f4d-a773ab206640]\n\n4. **Confidence**\n\n- Confidence is **medium**: the evidence clearly states the relationship between the dividend announcement and the April 26, 2024 valuation surge, but does not specify the precise announcement date, so the answer can only narrow it to \u201cshortly before April 26, 2024,\u201d not a specific day.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is that Alphabet announced its first-ever dividend payout in April 2024, alongside the $2 trillion market cap milestone. The agent instead claims the exact announcement date is not specified and only infers it was sometime shortly before April 26, 2024, without acknowledging that April 2024 is the answer and that it coincides with the $2 trillion milestone. This contradicts the expected answer and fails to provide the correct timeframe as given.",

[DOC: NO_ID, CHUNK: NO_CHUNK_ID]\n\n3. **Caveats**\n\n- The evidence only specifies \u201cmid\u20112022\u201d and does not provide an exact calendar date for the stock split.  \n- The Bloomberg item\u2019s date (2022\u201107\u201122) supports the general timing but does not itself state the effective split date. [DOC: NO_ID, CHUNK: NO_CHUNK_ID]\n\n4. **Confidence**\n\nConfidence is **moderate**: the timing as \u201cmid\u20112022\u201d is directly stated and independently corroborated by a July 2022 news reference, but the precise date of the split is not given in the available evidence.",
