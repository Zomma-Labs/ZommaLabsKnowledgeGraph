    "expected": "Several manufacturers noted that changing tariff policies were making it difficult to plan for the future.",
    "graphrag_answer": "Manufacturers faced several challenges regarding tariff policies, primarily related to increased costs and operational uncertainties. Key challenges included:\n\n1. **Rising Input Costs**: Tariffs significantly increased the costs of raw materials, imported components, and finished goods. This led to higher operating expenses for manufacturers across various sectors, including auto manufacturing and steel production (Community Reports, Tariffs and Supply Chain Cost Pressures).\n\n2. **Cost Pass-Through to Consumers**: Many manufacturers, particularly smaller ones, were compelled to pass these increased costs onto consumers, resulting in higher prices for consumer goods and manufacturing inputs. This contributed to inflationary pressures and reduced consumer purchasing power (Community Reports, Suppliers Respond to Tariff-Induced Pressures by Raising Prices; Cost Increases Passed Through to Customers by Smaller Manufacturers).\n\n3. **Uncertainty in Business Planning**: The unpredictability surrounding the timing and scope of tariffs complicated business planning and inventory management. Manufacturers had to adjust their strategies, including production and sourcing decisions, to navigate this uncertainty (Community Reports, Tariffs Introduce Strategic and Operational Uncertainty for Businesses).\n\n4. **Weakening Demand**: The increased costs and uncertainty led to weaker demand for manufactured goods, as businesses and consumers became more cautious. This was particularly evident in sectors like automotive, where manufacturers reported underperformance in shipments (Community Reports, Auto Manufacturers Face Rising Costs and Weakened Demand).\n\n5. **Dwindling Inventories of Pre-Tariff Goods**: As inventories of goods acquired before tariffs were depleted, manufacturers faced heightened exposure to the higher costs associated with new, tariff-affected goods. This transition added pressure to adjust pricing strategies (Community Reports, Dwindling Inventories of Pre-Tariff Goods Add to Uncertainty).\n\n6. **Strategic Adjustments**: Manufacturers had to make significant adjustments in their sourcing, production, and pricing strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs. This included reevaluating supply chains and seeking alternative sources for inputs (Community Reports, Tariffs Necessitate Strategic Adjustments in Sourcing, Production, and Pricing).\n\nOverall, the imposition of tariffs created a complex environment for manufacturers, characterized by increased costs, strategic challenges, and weakened demand.",

    "graphrag_answer": "Tariffs have significantly affected prices across various districts by increasing input and operating costs for a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, retail, and construction. The imposition of tariffs has led to higher prices for raw materials, imported components, and finished goods, compelling businesses to adjust their pricing strategies and often pass these costs onto consumers. For instance, tariffs have driven up costs for consumer goods such as vehicles, coffee, and chocolate, contributing to overall inflationary pressures in the retail sector (Tariffs Drive Up Costs Across a Wide Range of Consumer Goods).\n\nSuppliers have responded to these tariff-induced cost pressures by raising their prices, frequently citing tariffs as the primary reason (Suppliers Respond to Tariff-Induced Pressures by Raising Prices). Smaller manufacturers, in particular, have been noted to pass these increased expenses directly onto their customers, further amplifying the inflationary impact of tariffs across the economy (Cost Increases Passed Through to Customers by Smaller Manufacturers).\n\nAdditionally, the uncertainty surrounding tariffs has complicated business planning and inventory management, leading to further price adjustments as companies deplete their pre-tariff inventories and face higher costs for new goods (Dwindling Inventories of Pre-Tariff Goods Create Additional Pressure). This dynamic has resulted in a cascading effect throughout the supply chain, where higher costs are propagated from suppliers to manufacturers and ultimately to consumers (Tariff-Induced Cost Increases Passed Through to Customers).\n\nIn summary, tariffs have led to widespread price increases across districts by raising input costs, prompting businesses to pass these costs onto consumers, and creating uncertainty that complicates pricing strategies.",

Key indicators include:\n\n- **Home Sales**: Reported as flat or lower overall, with notable declines in regions like the Twelfth and Sixth Districts. This decline reflects reduced buyer demand and economic uncertainty.\n- **Housing Inventory**: There has been a **notable increase** in housing inventory, attributed to slower sales and reduced demand, leading to longer times on the market and potential downward pressure on prices.\n- **Market Dynamics**: The single-family market is shifting from a seller's market to a more balanced one, indicating reduced seller leverage due to increased inventory and subdued demand. Condominium sales have shown slight increases in some areas, but prices have fallen modestly in others.\n- **Interest Rate Sensitivity**: The market is highly sensitive to interest rates, with rising rates dampening demand and slowing transaction volumes.\n\n### Commercial Real Estate Conditions\nThe commercial real estate (CRE) sector is characterized by **moderate to slightly increasing activity**, but it faces several challenges:\n\n- **Leasing Activity**: There has been a seasonal uptick in leasing activity, particularly in office spaces, but this is uneven across property types. Office vacancy rates are increasing, particularly in regions like Southern California, which has led to downward pressure on rents.\n- **Operating Costs**: Rising operating costs are impacting profitability, with property owners facing challenges in managing expenses. This trend is compounded by limited investment sales and subdued new construction activity.\n- **Market Stability**: While office rents remain flat in some regions (e.g., Boston), the overall market is cautious, with many firms opting for short-term leases due to uncertainty.\n- **Investment Activity**: Limited investment sales reflect investor caution amid rising costs and uncertain returns, which may affect future development and transaction volumes.\n\nIn summary, the residential real estate market is facing significant challenges with declining sales and increased inventory, while the commercial real estate sector shows mixed activity with rising costs and increasing vacancies, particularly in office spaces.",

    "graphrag_answer": "Lower interest rates have generally spurred increased loan demand, particularly for business lending, as they reduce borrowing costs. This trend is evident in regions like Memphis, where lower rates have led to improved business lending activity, indicating that businesses are taking advantage of favorable borrowing conditions to finance expansion and operations (Financial Services, Loan Demand, and Interest Rate Dynamics Community).\n\nHowever, despite the potential for increased borrowing due to lower interest rates, a cautious \"sideline mentality\" among borrowers has emerged, driven by ongoing economic uncertainty. This has resulted in a notable impact on overall loan demand, as businesses and individuals are delaying new loans or financial commitments (Borrowers and Loan Demand Dynamics Community). Consequently, while lower interest rates typically encourage borrowing, the prevailing uncertainty has led to a decrease in actual loan demand, reflecting a complex interplay between interest rates and borrower sentiment.\n\nAdditionally, the tightening of loan terms by lenders in response to reduced demand further complicates the situation. Tighter terms can dampen demand even more, creating a feedback loop that constrains business growth and economic expansion (Business Loan Demand, Acquisition Activity, and Terms Community). Overall, while lower interest rates have the potential to stimulate business activity, the current economic climate has led to a cautious approach among borrowers, limiting the effectiveness of these lower rates in driving increased business activity.",

    "question": "In districts where financial conditions loosened, how did real estate activity perform?",
    "expected": "In the Chicago (Seventh) District, financial conditions loosened slightly in late August and September. Bond and equity values rose a bit. In the same district, nonresidential construction increased slightly and commercial real estate activity also increased slightly. The Cleveland (Fourth) District noted that commercial construction and financial services contacts saw an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates.",
    "graphrag_answer": "In districts where financial conditions loosened, real estate activity generally experienced subdued performance. Reports indicate a general decrease in residential real estate activity, characterized by declining home sales and increased housing inventory. For instance, the residential real estate sector is noted to have \"flat or lower\" home sales overall, with some areas experiencing slow markets and declining house prices. The shift from a seller's market to a more balanced market in single-family homes reflects this trend, as increased inventory and subdued demand reduce sellers' leverage (Data: Entities 26, 104, 735).\n\nMoreover, while the luxury new home market showed some resilience, the entry-level segment faced persistently muted demand, which significantly impacted overall sales figures (Data: Entities 650, 651). The overall decline in home sales, particularly in the starter home segment, suggests that even in districts with looser financial conditions, real estate activity did not see a corresponding increase, highlighting the complex interplay between financial conditions and market dynamics.",

    "expected": "Higher-income individuals maintained strong spending on luxury travel and accommodation. Lower- and middle-income households sought discounts and promotions due to rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. This bifurcation was driven by rising prices eroding purchasing power for lower/middle-income groups while higher-income groups remained insulated.",
    "graphrag_answer": "Consumer spending patterns varied significantly between income groups, primarily driven by economic pressures and credit reliance. \n\n1. **Middle-Income Consumers**: This group is increasingly cautious and has been described as experiencing a \"middle-class recession.\" They are heavily reliant on credit to maintain their spending levels amid rising prices and economic uncertainty. Their cautious behavior is reflected in their search for discounts and promotions, indicating a heightened price sensitivity (Community Reports).\n\n2. **Lower-Income Households**: Similar to middle-income consumers, lower-income households are also price-sensitive and actively seek markdowns and promotions to stimulate purchasing activity. This behavior is driven by economic uncertainty and the need to manage limited financial resources (Community Reports).\n\n3. **Upper-Income Households**: In contrast, mid- to upper-income consumers have demonstrated resilience, maintaining or even increasing their expenditures. This group continues to spend on discretionary items such as travel and luxury services, which supports specific sectors of the economy (Community Reports). Their financial stability allows them to be less affected by economic fluctuations compared to lower-income groups.\n\nOverall, the differences in consumer spending patterns are largely driven by economic pressures, credit reliance, and varying levels of financial stability across income groups. Middle- and lower-income consumers are more affected by economic uncertainties, leading to cautious spending and a reliance on credit, while upper-income households continue to drive growth in consumer spending due to their financial resilience.",

    "expected": "Some employers cited increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies as one of the reasons for lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. This occurred alongside other factors like weaker demand and elevated economic uncertainty. Overall employment levels were largely stable, but demand for labor was generally muted, with more employers reporting layoffs and attrition.",
    "graphrag_answer": "The Beige Book reports indicate a clear relationship between AI investment and employment trends, characterized by significant workforce reductions and a hiring chill. Increased investment in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, is directly linked to head count reductions as firms automate tasks previously performed by human workers. This trend has led to layoffs and a decrease in the need for certain job roles, contributing to a broader contraction in employment levels across various sectors (e.g., professional services and restaurants) [Data: Entities (548, 584); Relationships (577)].\n\nMoreover, the adoption of AI technologies is not only resulting in job losses but is also causing firms to adopt more cautious hiring practices, leading to fewer head count additions and a stagnation in workforce numbers. This \"hiring chill\" reflects a strategic shift where companies prioritize automation over expanding their human workforce, further exacerbating the impact on overall employment levels [Data: Entities (547, 584); Relationships (545)].\n\nIn summary, the relationship between AI investment and employment trends is marked by a dual effect: while AI enhances operational efficiency, it simultaneously drives layoffs and reduces hiring, leading to a more flexible but less stable labor market.",

Districts with decline (New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco) had varied outlooks: New York businesses did not expect activity to increase much; Kansas City was broadly optimistic for 2026 despite recent declines; Minneapolis saw contraction across most sectors.",
    "graphrag_answer": "The economic outlook between districts that experienced growth and those that saw decline presents a stark contrast in sentiment and performance.\n\n**Districts with Growth:**\n1. **Energy Sector Resilience**: In the Sixth District, energy activity has shown moderate expansion, particularly in crude oil production and liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, which are bolstering the regional economy. This growth is critical for maintaining economic health and supporting employment in related industries (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta).\n2. **Cautious Optimism**: The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland reports a general expectation of modest growth in business activity over the next six months, indicating a resilient economic environment despite current flatness (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland).\n3. **Strong Demand in Specific Sectors**: The luxury new home market remains robust, contrasting with the overall decline in home sales, suggesting that higher-end buyers are still active (District Home Sales and Market Segments).\n\n**Districts with Decline:**\n1. **Transportation and Retail Challenges**: The Sixth District has experienced a modest decline in transportation activity and retail sales, particularly in sectors like building materials and electronics, indicating reduced consumer demand and broader economic headwinds (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta).\n2. **Pessimism in Outlooks**: The Eleventh District reflects a prevailing pessimism regarding future economic performance, with businesses expressing increased uncertainty and negative outlooks (Economic Outlooks and Projections for 2025-2026).\n3. **Labor Market Strain**: In the Cleveland district, there are reports of skilled worker shortages in construction due to the demand from data center construction, while retail sectors are exhibiting caution, leading to reduced hiring and operational activity (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland).\n\nIn summary, districts experiencing growth are characterized by sector-specific resilience, particularly in energy and luxury markets, alongside cautious optimism for future activity.

In the St. Louis District, agriculture conditions were strained and further deteriorated, with the overall pessimistic outlook. Across reporting districts, activity in agriculture was generally down, with trade uncertainty adding to sector challenges.",
    "graphrag_answer": "Trade-related concerns have significantly impacted the agriculture sector across different districts, primarily through fluctuations in commodity prices and changes in export dynamics. \n\n1. **Mixed Commodity Price Trends**: The agriculture sector has experienced a divergence in commodity prices, with some products like cattle and corn reaching record highs, while others, such as wheat, milk, and poultry, have faced declines. For instance, cattle prices have reached record levels, providing strong support for farmers, while wheat and milk prices have decreased, negatively affecting profitability for those producers (Community Reports).\n\n2. **Export Activity Influence**: Export dynamics, particularly for corn, have been highlighted as a critical factor in the agricultural economy. The connection of corn to export markets indicates that broader economic and policy factors can influence local commodity prices and production levels. The decline in overseas sales of U.S. rice, as buyers shift to other countries, exemplifies how international trade dynamics can adversely affect domestic producers (Community Reports).\n\n3. **Regional Disparities**: The impact of trade-related concerns is not uniform across districts. Some areas, like the Sixth District, report relatively healthy agricultural conditions, while others, such as Arkansas, face acute financial distress due to low prices and high costs, leading to a risk of widespread bankruptcies among farmers (U.S. Agriculture Sector).\n\n4. **Financial Strain and Sentiment**: Farmers' sentiment and financial well-being are highly sensitive to market conditions, particularly the prices they receive for their products. The mixed trends in commodity prices create both opportunities and risks, with rising prices in some segments helping to offset declines in others, thereby influencing overall profitability and outlook for farmers (Community Reports).\n\nIn summary, trade-related concerns have led to significant price volatility and shifts in export dynamics, which have varied impacts on the agricultural sector's profitability and stability across different districts.",

In the Cleveland District, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to uncertainty around federal grants. In the Boston District, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health-care sectors.",
    "graphrag_answer": "Federal policy changes, particularly reductions in federal funding and benefits, have significantly impacted nonprofits across multiple districts, particularly in the New York and Eleventh Districts. These changes have led to:\n\n1. **Funding Instability**: Nonprofits are facing acute funding declines due to cuts and unpredictability in federal grants and benefit programs. This has resulted in operational challenges, including staffing shortages and the inability to meet community needs (Community Reports, New York District Nonprofits).\n\n2. **Increased Demand for Services**: Despite the funding cuts, there has been a surge in demand for social services, which has strained the already limited resources of nonprofits. This mismatch between rising community needs and reduced capacity has raised concerns about unmet needs among vulnerable populations (Community Reports, Nonprofits face acute funding instability).\n\n3. **Staffing Challenges**: Many nonprofits have been forced to reduce their workforce due to financial pressures, making it difficult to fill open positions. This staffing shortage undermines their ability to respond effectively to the increased demand for services (Community Reports, Staffing shortages are undermining the capacity of nonprofits).\n\n4. **Financial Distress Among Service Users**: The reductions in federal benefits have also led to heightened financial distress among populations served by nonprofits, such as Medicaid patients, limiting their access to necessary health-care services (Community Reports, Medicaid patients are experiencing heightened financial distress).\n\n5. **Exploration of Alternative Revenue Streams**: In response to these challenges, nonprofits are actively seeking alternative revenue sources to sustain their operations. This shift, while necessary, introduces new complexities and risks (Community Reports, Nonprofits are actively seeking alternative revenue streams).\n\nOverall, the interconnectedness of funding cuts, staffing shortages, and increased demand for services creates a systemic risk for nonprofits, threatening their sustainability and the well-being of the communities they serve (Community Reports, The interconnectedness of funding, staffing, and service demand creates systemic risk).",

    "expected": "Responses to tariff-induced costs varied by sector: In manufacturing and retail trades, some firms fully passed higher import costs along to customers. Other firms facing tariff-induced cost pressures kept selling prices largely unchanged to preserve market share and due to pushback from price-sensitive clients. In Chicago, a retail industry analyst expected peak tariff impact in the first half of 2026.",
    "graphrag_answer": "Firms across various sectors have responded to tariff-induced cost increases primarily through price pass-through strategies, where they transfer the increased costs to consumers by raising prices. This practice has been widely adopted as a mechanism to cope with the financial pressures imposed by tariffs, which have significantly increased operating costs.\n\n1. **General Response**: Many firms, regardless of industry, have engaged in negotiations with suppliers to manage rising costs and have often passed these costs onto customers. This is evident in the reports indicating that \"price pass-through is a common response to tariff-induced cost increases\" (Tariff Impacts Community).\n\n2. **Manufacturing and Retail**: In the manufacturing and retail sectors, suppliers have raised their prices due to tariff pressures, which has led manufacturers and retailers to adjust their pricing strategies accordingly. Smaller manufacturers, in particular, have been noted for directly passing on these increased costs to their customers, contributing to higher prices for consumer goods (Tariffs and Supply Chain Cost Pressures in Manufacturing and Retail).\n\n3. **Auto Industry**: Auto manufacturers have faced increased costs for imported components and raw materials due to tariffs. They have had to absorb some of these costs to maintain demand while also passing some onto consumers, resulting in weaker-than-expected auto shipments (Tariffs and Supply Chain Cost Pressures in Manufacturing and Retail).\n\n4. **Steel Producers**: In contrast, steel producers have opted to hold their prices steady despite rising costs and slower demand, indicating a more cautious approach to pricing in an effort to preserve margins (Tariffs and Supply Chain Cost Pressures in Manufacturing and Retail).\n\n5. **Foreign Producers**: In response to U.S. tariffs, foreign producers have cut prices to retain market share, which reflects a competitive adjustment to the cost pressures faced by U.S. firms (Tariffs and Supply Chain Cost Dynamics Community).\n\nOverall, the trend indicates that while many firms are passing costs onto consumers, the strategies vary by sector, with some opting to absorb costs or hold prices steady to maintain competitiveness.

    "expected": "Auto sales were boosted in some districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September. However, in the Chicago District, light vehicle sales declined overall, especially for EVs following the end of federal tax credits. This shows the federal tax credit created a pre-expiration demand surge followed by a post-expiration decline.",
    "graphrag_answer": "The relationship between federal policy and electric vehicle (EV) sales is primarily driven by the federal tax credits, which have significantly influenced consumer behavior in New Hampshire. The impending expiration of these tax credits has led to a notable increase in electric vehicle purchases as consumers rushed to take advantage of the incentives before they lapsed. This surge in EV sales has modestly boosted overall auto sales in the state, indicating that government policy can have a direct impact on market trends and consumer decisions (New Hampshire Electric Vehicle Auto Sales and Tax Credit Community).\n\nSpecifically, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston reported that the expiration of federal tax credits acted as a catalyst for increased EV purchases, which in turn contributed to a modest uptick in overall auto sales (New Hampshire Electric Vehicle Auto Sales and Tax Credit Community). This relationship underscores the significant influence of federal policy on consumer behavior, particularly in the electric vehicle segment, which is characterized by evolving preferences and responsiveness to financial incentives (Auto Dealers and Market Dynamics: Margins, Inventory, and EV Incentives).\n\nIn summary, the expiration of federal tax credits has driven up electric vehicle sales, leading to a modest increase in overall auto sales, highlighting the critical role of federal policy in shaping market dynamics.",

Additionally, some contacts in the Chicago District reported moderate increases in nonlabor costs including energy and higher prices for raw materials. This meant total compensation costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.",
    "graphrag_answer": "Labor costs are influenced by several interrelated factors, primarily wage growth, employer-sponsored health insurance expenses, and labor shortages. \n\n1. **Wage Growth**: Wages have seen modest to moderate growth across various sectors, contributing directly to increased labor cost pressures for employers. Even slight wage increases can significantly impact overall labor costs, especially when combined with other rising expenses (Data: Entities (39, 40); Relationships (84)).\n\n2. **Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance Expenses**: There have been outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance costs, which represent a significant component of labor costs. These rising expenses intensify labor cost pressures, as employers strive to maintain competitive benefits while managing escalating healthcare costs (Data: Entities (41, 40, 105); Relationships (54, 87, 88)).\n\n3. **Labor Shortages**: Labor shortages, particularly in sectors like construction and manufacturing, exacerbate wage pressures as employers compete for a limited pool of workers. This competition drives up wages, which in turn increases labor cost pressures, creating a feedback loop where rising costs and shortages reinforce each other (Data: Entities (80, 39, 40); Relationships (84)).\n\n4. **Immigration Policies**: Changes in immigration policies have contributed to labor shortages, further complicating the labor market dynamics. Restrictions on the supply of skilled and unskilled workers can lead to increased costs and reduced industry growth, impacting wage dynamics (Data: Relationships (83); Entities (80)).\n\n5. **Sector-Specific Variations**: The degree of wage growth and labor cost pressures varies significantly across sectors. Industries like construction and manufacturing are particularly sensitive to labor shortages and wage competition, leading to higher operational costs (Data: Entities (39, 80)).\n\nIn summary, the interaction of these factors creates a complex environment where rising labor costs are driven by modest wage growth, significant increases in health insurance expenses, and acute labor shortages, all of which are influenced by sector-specific dynamics and immigration policies.

Demand from restaurant groups remained solid, as indicated by commercial real estate leasing activity.",
    "graphrag_answer": "In the Chicago District, consumer spending patterns have significantly influenced different restaurant segments within the food and hospitality sector. Key observations include:\n\n1. **Value Awareness**: Customers are becoming more value-conscious, which has affected spending behaviors across various restaurant segments. This trend indicates that consumers are prioritizing cost-effectiveness in their dining choices, leading to a shift in demand towards more affordable dining options.\n\n2. **Impact of Economic Uncertainty**: Economic pressures, such as rising prices and concerns about tariffs, have led to a cautious approach among consumers, particularly affecting discretionary spending in restaurants. This has resulted in a decline in demand from international travelers, while domestic consumer demand has remained stable.\n\n3. **Luxury Spending Resilience**: Despite broader economic challenges, higher-income individuals continue to spend robustly on luxury dining experiences. This segment's sustained demand provides a buffer for upscale restaurants, allowing them to maintain profitability even as other segments face declines.\n\n4. **Price Sensitivity Among Lower-Income Consumers**: Lower- and middle-income households are increasingly seeking discounts and promotions, which has led to a greater reliance on markdowns to stimulate purchasing activity. This behavior is particularly pronounced in casual dining and fast-food segments, where price sensitivity is higher.\n\n5. **Labor Cost Management**: Restaurateurs are focusing on controlling labor costs, often hiring at minimum wage to manage expenses amid fluctuating demand. This reflects the challenges faced by the hospitality sector in maintaining profitability while adapting to changing consumer preferences.\n\nOverall, the interplay between consumer spending patterns, economic conditions, and income segmentation has created a complex landscape for restaurants in the Chicago District, with varying impacts across different segments of the industry.",

This indicates a resilient sector that is effectively supporting economic growth (Financial Services, Loan Demand, and Interest Rate Dynamics Community).\n\n2. **Business Lending**: In certain districts, lower interest rates have improved business lending, suggesting that businesses are taking advantage of favorable borrowing conditions to finance expansion and operations. For instance, commercial loan demand has been particularly strong in Memphis, despite some tightening of lending standards (Financial Services Sector as a Central Economic Pillar; Banking Sector Credit Conditions and Lending Standards - Memphis Focus).\n\n3. **Household Borrowing**: Households have also responded positively to lower interest rates, with increased demand for loans reflecting their willingness to borrow. This trend is crucial for economic activity, as it indicates confidence among consumers (Households as Key Economic Actors).\n\n4. **Regional Variations**: However, the impact of lower interest rates has not been uniform across all regions. For example, while the Kansas City District reported stable loan demand, the Second District experienced declines. This highlights the sensitivity of loan demand to local economic conditions and the need for regionally tailored financial strategies (Regional and Sectoral Variations in Loan Demand).\n\n5. **Residential Real Estate**: In the residential real estate market, lower mortgage rates are expected to shift demand from rentals to home purchases, potentially reducing rental demand and improving home affordability.

Tariff-induced input cost increases affected manufacturing across many districts, with firms reporting difficulty planning due to changing tariff policies. Labor shortages due to immigration policy changes also constrained production in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture sectors.",
    "graphrag_answer": "Manufacturing has been significantly affected by supply chain disruptions primarily due to tariffs and underperforming shipments. Key disruptions include:\n\n1. **Increased Costs from Tariffs**: Tariffs have raised production costs for auto manufacturers, compelling them to absorb these increases to maintain demand. This strategy, while preserving short-term market share, threatens long-term profitability and financial stability (Community Reports, Auto Manufacturers and Tariff-Impacted Shipments).\n\n2. **Underperformance in Port Shipments**: Shipments of automobiles through ports have been reported as below expectations, indicating logistical challenges that may stem from supply chain disruptions, decreased demand, or operational inefficiencies. This underperformance creates bottlenecks that exacerbate financial and operational challenges for manufacturers (Community Reports, Auto Manufacturers and Tariff-Impacted Shipments).\n\n3. **Cascading Effects on the Supply Chain**: The imposition of tariffs has not only impacted manufacturers but also affected suppliers and logistics providers, leading to reduced orders for parts and materials. This cascading effect disrupts delivery schedules and inventory management throughout the supply chain (Community Reports, Tariffs have a cascading effect on the entire automotive supply chain).\n\n4. **Rising Input Costs**: Tariffs have led to increased costs for raw materials and imported components across various manufacturing sectors, including automotive and steel.

    "graphrag_answer": "Rising health-care costs have significantly contributed to increased input costs across various sectors, particularly affecting the Nonfinancial Services and Health Care sectors. Specifically, the health care industry is facing challenges due to escalating expenses related to labor market conditions and ongoing wage negotiations, which have directly impacted the cost structure of health care providers. This increase in health-care costs has led to higher input costs for businesses, influencing their pricing, hiring, and investment decisions (Community Reports, \"Rising Health-Care Costs Drive Up Input Costs for Businesses\").\n\nAdditionally, labor market pressures, including difficulties in finding workers and strong wage growth, have also contributed to rising costs in the Leisure and Hospitality sectors, further exacerbating input cost challenges (Community Reports, \"Labor Market Pressures Are a Common Challenge Across Multiple Sectors\"). The interconnectedness of these sectors means that rising health-care costs not only impact the health care industry but also increase input costs for businesses across the broader Nonfinancial Services sector (Community Reports, \"Sectoral Interconnections Amplify Community-Wide Impacts\"). \n\nOverall, the rising costs in health care and labor are creating financial pressures that affect operational stability and growth prospects across multiple sectors, highlighting the need for ongoing monitoring and adaptive strategies (Community Reports, \"Uncertainty About Future Growth Persists Across the Community\").",

    "question": "Which retail categories saw gains versus declines, and how does this reflect consumer behavior patterns?",
    "expected": "In Chicago, leisure and hospitality sales were mixed. Categories seeing gains included restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments, as well as new light vehicle sales which were brisk due to strong underlying demand and the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases. Categories seeing softness included travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels. Used vehicle sales remained steady though dealerships in low-to-moderate income communities reported softer demand. This pattern reflects consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.",
    "graphrag_answer": "In the recent Beige Book economic reports, retail categories exhibited mixed performance, with notable gains in essential goods sectors and declines in durable goods sectors. \n\n**Gains:**\n1. **Health Care Retailers**: Reported stable to slight increases in sales, indicating resilience in the essential goods sector. This suggests that consumer demand for health-related products remains consistent, even amid broader retail declines (Data: Entities 1111).\n2. **Food and Beverage Retailers**: Also saw flat to slight increases in sales, reflecting steady demand for essential consumables, which consumers prioritize regardless of economic fluctuations (Data: Entities 1112).\n3. **Apparel**: A department store in the Second District reported strengthening sales in apparel, attributed to increased consumer spending, indicating a positive trend in this category (Data: Entities 255).\n\n**Declines:**\n1. **Building Materials and Garden Equipment Stores**: Experienced reduced sales, likely due to decreased consumer demand influenced by economic uncertainty and higher interest rates (Data: Entities 1108).\n2. **Furniture Stores**: Reported lower sales, reflecting a trend of consumers postponing large purchases amid economic uncertainty (Data: Entities 1109).\n3. **Electronic and Appliance Stores**: Saw a decline in sales, suggesting reduced discretionary spending as consumers become more cautious (Data: Entities 1110).\n\n**Consumer Behavior Patterns**: The overall decline in retail sales, particularly in durable goods sectors, indicates a shift in consumer behavior towards prioritizing essential goods over discretionary purchases. This trend is likely driven by economic uncertainty, inflation, and changing household budgets, as consumers exhibit increased price sensitivity and adaptability in their spending habits (Data: Entities 239). The mixed performance across retail subsectors underscores divergent consumer priorities, with essential goods maintaining stability while discretionary categories face challenges.",

    "question": "How did energy sector performance vary across districts, and what specific activities were mentioned?",
    "expected": "Energy sector performance varied significantly: In Atlanta (Sixth District), energy grew moderately - a positive outlier. In Dallas (Eleventh District), drilling and well completion activity was flat. Nationally, energy activity was generally down among reporting districts. The Chicago District noted higher energy prices as part of nonlabor cost increases affecting manufacturers.",
    "graphrag_answer": "Energy sector performance varied significantly across districts, with notable activities highlighted in the reports:\n\n1. **Sixth District (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta)**:\n   - **Crude Oil Production**: The Gulf of Mexico reported strong crude oil production, contributing positively to the regional economy. This robust output contrasts with stagnation in drilling and well completion activities due to low oil prices and rising breakeven costs.\n   - **Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Exports**: There was moderate expansion in energy activity, particularly in LNG exports, which remained robust and supported global demand. This sector is crucial for the region's economic resilience.\n   - **Refined Products**: There was a noted softening demand for refined products, indicating challenges within this segment of the energy market.\n\n2. **Cleveland District**:\n   - **Data Center Construction**: The construction of data centers has significantly driven demand for energy, particularly fossil fuels and electricity generation. This sector is absorbing skilled workers and stimulating related industries.\n   - **Energy Demand**: The expansion of data centers is influencing energy and infrastructure sectors, leading to increased orders for energy-related services.\n\n3. **General Trends**:\n   - Across various districts, there is a trend of softening demand for refined products and labor in certain sectors, reflecting broader economic headwinds.\n   - The energy industry is diversifying, with segments like solar development and carbon capture gaining attention, although solar projects have recently slowed.\n\nIn summary, while the Gulf of Mexico's crude oil production and LNG exports are performing strongly, other areas like refined products are facing challenges, and the energy sector is adapting to new demands from emerging industries like data centers.",

    "question": "How did banking conditions differ for consumer versus business lending across districts?",
    "expected": "In Kansas City, while expectations for 2026 were optimistic, consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately, signaling stress among households. In Chicago, business loan demand decreased slightly on net with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity, while consumer loan demand increased slightly with a pickup in mortgage refinancing. In Dallas, loan demand grew overall. St. Louis reported banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions. Consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.",
    "graphrag_answer": "Banking conditions for consumer versus business lending across districts show notable differences. \n\nIn the New York District, consumer lending is characterized by steady demand, particularly for consumer loans and residential mortgages, despite a deterioration in the quality of the consumer loan portfolio. This suggests that while more individuals are borrowing, their ability to repay is declining, raising concerns about future credit quality (e.g., \"Consumer loan portfolio quality is deteriorating despite ongoing demand\"). \n\nConversely, business lending is facing challenges, with a decline in demand for business loans and worsening delinquency rates. This indicates that businesses are either less willing or able to take on new debt, reflecting broader economic uncertainty (e.g., \"Demand for business loans has been declining, and delinquency rates for these loans have worsened slightly\"). The combination of reduced demand and rising delinquencies suggests emerging financial stress among business borrowers.\n\nIn the Memphis focus, while there is moderate loan demand overall, banks are tightening lending standards, particularly affecting smaller investors, which may limit access to credit for businesses (e.g., \"Limited Access to Credit for Smaller Investors\"). However, commercial loan demand remains strong, indicating some resilience in that sector despite stricter lending criteria.\n\nOverall, consumer lending shows steady demand but deteriorating quality, while business lending is marked by declining demand and rising delinquencies, highlighting a more cautious environment for businesses compared to consumers.",

    "question": "How did price pressures differ between manufacturing and services sectors?",
    "expected": "In Dallas, price pressures were subdued in services but remained elevated in the manufacturing sector. In Richmond, price growth remained moderate overall despite some pickup in price growth in the manufacturing sector. In Chicago, producer prices grew moderately with contacts reporting moderate nonlabor cost increases including energy and raw materials. Manufacturing contacts attributed some raw materials price increases to tariffs, suggesting tariffs disproportionately affected goods-producing sectors.",
    "graphrag_answer": "Price pressures in the manufacturing and services sectors exhibited notable differences. \n\nIn the manufacturing sector, there were strong pressures from rising input and raw material costs, which significantly influenced overall price increases. Manufacturing firms reported that input prices grew at a strong pace, with raw material costs previously described as being at a 'boil' but now shifting to a 'simmer,' indicating some moderation yet still elevated costs (Data: Entities (993, 1051)). The overall price increases in manufacturing were characterized as modest to moderate, driven by these input cost pressures (Data: Entities (42, 950)).\n\nConversely, in the services sector, particularly within professional and business services, wage growth remained modest to moderate, with easing wage pressures contributing to this moderation (Data: Entities (195, 386)). While there were still localized wage increases due to labor market competition, the overall intensity of wage pressures was diminishing, leading to a more stable wage environment (Data: Relationships (613)). Additionally, the nonfinancial services sector faced rising costs, particularly in health care, which contributed to increased input costs but did not exhibit the same level of price pressure as manufacturing (Data: Entities (46, 331)).\n\nIn summary, manufacturing faced stronger and more direct input cost pressures leading to price increases, while the services sector experienced more moderate wage growth and easing pressures, resulting in less pronounced price pressures overall.",

    "question": "How did hiring patterns change, and what does this indicate about employer confidence?",
    "expected": "Employers showed cautious hiring behavior: More employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. Those still hiring favored temporary and part-time workers over full-time employment. In Boston, both hiring and layoffs increased modestly, indicating churn rather than net growth. Employment in IT services increased modestly with hiring in sales and technical positions - a relative bright spot. Jobseekers in Cleveland reported offers were more likely to be part-time with little or no benefits. This pattern indicates employer uncertainty and reluctance to commit to permanent workforce expansion.",
    "graphrag_answer": "Hiring patterns have shifted towards cautiousness, with employers increasingly selective and focused on maintaining stable head counts rather than expanding their workforce. This is evidenced by reports of stabilizing or declining head counts, where most employers are hiring only to replace departing workers rather than adding new positions. The trend of increased use of temporary and part-time work arrangements further indicates a preference for flexibility in staffing, allowing firms to manage costs amid economic uncertainty.\n\nThese cautious hiring practices reflect a broader lack of employer confidence, as firms are responding to mixed labor demand and uncertainties in consumer demand and labor supply. The overall waning of labor demand, coupled with selective hiring and a focus on cost containment, suggests that employers are hesitant to commit to long-term staffing increases. This is further supported by the rise in temporary employment and the reduction of staffing hours in response to softer sales, indicating a labor market under pressure and a reluctance to expand in the face of economic challenges. \n\nIn summary, the changes in hiring patterns\u2014characterized by selective hiring, increased temporary arrangements, and a focus on cost management\u2014indicate a significant level of caution and reduced confidence among employers regarding future economic conditions.",

    "expected": "Chicago District indicators: Economic activity was little changed (matching national 'little change on balance'). Consumer spending increased modestly (better than national 'inched down'). Manufacturing demand declined modestly (consistent with national challenging conditions). Employment was flat (matching national stable levels). Wages and benefits costs were up modestly (matching national modest-to-moderate). Prices rose moderately (matching national rising trend). Financial conditions loosened slightly (better than mixed national picture). Construction/real estate increased slightly (better than mixed national). Farm income prospects unchanged. Compared to national trends, Chicago showed relative strength in financial conditions, construction, and consumer spending while manufacturing weakness aligned with broader trends.",
    "graphrag_answer": "The key economic indicators for the Chicago (Seventh) District, as reported in the Beige Book, include:\n\n1. **Labor Markets**: The labor market is being closely monitored, with ongoing challenges reported by nonprofit organizations due to increased demand for services and funding constraints.\n\n2. **Prices**: There is a focus on price stability and inflationary pressures, although specific data on price changes was not detailed in the reports.\n\n3. **Consumer and Business Spending**: The reports indicate varying levels of consumer and business spending, with nonprofits highlighting increased demand for their services, suggesting a strain on resources.\n\n4. **Construction and Manufacturing**: The economic activity in construction and manufacturing sectors is part of the monitoring, but specific trends were not detailed in the provided reports.\n\n5. **Banking and Agriculture**: The banking sector's health and agricultural conditions are also monitored, reflecting the diverse economic landscape of the district.\n\nIn comparison to national trends, the Seventh District's economic conditions reflect a nuanced understanding of local realities, with nonprofit organizations facing unique challenges that may not be as pronounced at the national level. The interconnectedness of various sectors within the district emphasizes the need for tailored policy responses, which may differ from broader national economic trends. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's role in integrating these insights into national monetary policy highlights the importance of local economic conditions in shaping overall economic strategies.",
