      "system_answer": "From mid‑August to the time of the Beige Book report released on October 15, 2025, economic activity in the Twelfth District (San Francisco) moved from relative steadiness to a slight overall contraction, with increasing signs of softening by late September.\n\n**Mid‑August 2025 (start of reporting period)**  \n- At the beginning of the mid‑August–to‑September window, conditions were coming off a prior period that had been more stable or slightly stronger; the outlook reported in the new Beige Book was described as “somewhat weaker than in the prior report,” implying that earlier in the summer activity had been steadier or modestly stronger.\n- Employment levels were already near flat, with firms not aggressively expanding headcount.\n\n**Mid‑August to late September 2025: gradual softening and slight contraction**  \nOver the course of the mid‑August through September reporting period, contacts in the Twelfth District reported that:\n\n- **Overall activity**: Economic activity **“edged down slightly”**, signaling a **modest contraction** rather than expansion or full stability. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Outlook**: The outlook **weakened somewhat** compared with the previous Beige Book, suggesting rising caution as the period progressed.\n- **Labor market**: \n  - Employment remained **largely flat**; firms generally **held headcounts steady** rather than hiring or laying off in large numbers.  \n  - This indicates that while activity softened, it had not yet translated into broad labor market cuts by late September.\n- **Wages and prices**:  \n  - **Wages increased slightly**, showing continued, but modest, upward pressure on labor costs.  \n  - **Prices rose modestly**, indicating continued but subdued inflationary pressures despite weaker activity.\n\n**Sector‑specific changes over the period (mid‑August–September 2025)**  \nAs the period progressed, the pattern was one of slight broad weakening with notable sector differences:\n\n- **Retail trade**: Activity **declined somewhat**, contributing to the overall slight downturn.\n- **Residential real estate**: **Softened/declined**, indicating reduced sales or construction relative to earlier in the year.\n- **Agriculture**: Also **declined somewhat**, adding to the district’s overall modest contraction.\n- **Small businesses**: Reported **modest weakening**, particularly in activity and demand, over the reporting window.\n- **Community support organizations**: Experienced **modest weakening**, suggesting rising strain on these organizations as the period went on.\n- **Commercial real estate**: Conditions were **unchanged** over the mid‑August–September period, neither clearly improving nor deteriorating.\n- **Manufacturing and lending**: Remained **largely stable**, not contributing significantly to the downturn but also not offsetting declines elsewhere.\n- **Consumer and business services**: Conditions were **mixed**, with some service providers seeing stable or decent demand and others experiencing weakening as the period advanced.\n\n**By late September 2025 (end of reporting period)**  \n- The Twelfth District’s economy was characterized by a **slight overall weakening** compared with earlier in the summer.  \n- The district had shifted from a previously steadier environment to one where:  \n  - Overall activity had **edged down slightly**;  \n  - The **outlook was more cautious**;  \n  - Key cyclical sectors—**retail, residential real estate, agriculture, and small businesses**—were weaker, while **employment, commercial real estate, manufacturing, and lending** were generally stable.\n\nIn temporal terms, then, the trajectory from mid‑August through late September 2025 in the Twelfth District was one of **transition from relative stability to a modest, broad‑based but mild contraction**, with growing caution about future conditions by the time of the October 15, 2025 Beige Book.

      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Overall economic activity in the Twelfth District edged down slightly.\n2) Activity in retail trade either decreased or remained stable.\n3) Activity in agriculture either decreased or remained stable.\n4) Activity in residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.\n\nThe system answer states:\n- Overall activity \"edged down slightly\" and describes this as a modest contraction → matches (1).\n- Retail trade: activity \"declined somewhat\" → consistent with (2).\n- Residential real estate: \"softened/declined\" → consistent with (3).\n- Agriculture: \"declined somewhat\" → consistent with (4).\n\nAll key elements of the ground‑truth summary are present and correctly characterized. The system adds extra sectoral and temporal detail (labor market, wages, prices, manufacturing, lending, etc.), but none of this contradicts the expected answer. There are no factual conflicts with the ground truth as stated. Therefore the answer fully covers and elaborates on the expected content without introducing errors.\n\nVerdict: correct.",

      "expected_answer": "Three districts reported slight to modest growth: Boston (First District), Philadelphia (Third District), and Richmond (Fifth District).",
      "system_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, the following Districts are explicitly reported as having **slight to modest economic growth**:\n\n- **Boston (First District)**\n  - Described as having “economic activity expanded slightly, with modest growth in consumer spending.”  \n  - This characterizes overall activity as **slight** with elements of **modest** growth.\n\n- **Philadelphia (Third District)**\n  - Reported that “economic activity in the Third District increased slightly after rising modestly in the prior period.”  \n  - This is an explicit characterization of **slight** current growth following **modest** prior growth.\n\n- **Richmond (Fifth District)**\n  - Noted that “the Fifth District economy continued to grow modestly this cycle.”  \n  - This directly labels overall economic growth as **modest**.\n\nIn addition, the National Summary states that **three Districts** reported “slight to modest” overall economic growth, but it does **not** name them. From the excerpts, Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond all fit that description, and Philadelphia is explicitly linked to slight overall growth. However, the document does not definitively confirm that these three are exactly the same three referenced in the National Summary.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the expected answer: exactly three districts reported slight to modest economic growth, and they are Boston (First), Philadelphia (Third), and Richmond (Fifth).\n\nSystem answer:\n- Lists Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond as the districts with slight to modest economic growth, matching the ground truth set.\n- Provides additional descriptive quotes consistent with that characterization.\n- Adds a cautious note that the National Summary mentions three districts but does not name them, so the match is inferred from excerpts. This is not a contradiction of the ground truth, just a caveat about explicitness.\n\nThere are no factual errors relative to the expected answer, and all key facts are present: the correct three districts are identified. Extra commentary about explicit confirmation does not negate the correctness of the identified districts.\n\nTherefore the answer aligns fully with the expected answer.",

It was not flat and did not increase; the change was modest but clearly negative.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\nSo, over the reporting window leading into mid‑October 2025, overall consumer spending **transitioned from a somewhat higher level to a slightly lower one, with a small but noticeable decline in recent weeks** as documented in the October 15, 2025 report.",

This directly matches the key fact about the direction (down), magnitude (slight/inched down), and timeframe (recent weeks). The mention of earlier being higher is consistent and not contradictory. There are no factual errors relative to the ground truth and the core information is captured.\n\nThus the answer is correct and even uses the same phrasing \"inched down.\"",

[BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Middle-income households**: in addition to cutting discretionary spending, **leaned more on credit (BNPL and credit cards)** in the St. Louis District, where this behavior coincided with **elevated credit card delinquency rates** and was characterized by some contacts as a **“middle-class recession.”** [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nWhere earlier claims mentioned broad national patterns such as widespread savings drawdowns or difficulties paying rent and utilities for lower-income households, those specific mechanisms are **not directly documented** in the cited Beige Book excerpts and thus are not included as evidenced facts here.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "The expected answer is short and specific: lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in response to rising prices and uncertainty. The system answer is much longer and adds many behaviors: tightening spending, cutting discretionary spending, turning to food pantries, leaning more on credit, BNPL, elevated delinquencies, travel reductions, etc. While it does include one overlapping idea—that lower-income households became more price-sensitive and relied on discounts/value-oriented shopping—this goes beyond the expected answer and introduces many details that are not in the ground truth. Under the rubric, introducing substantial extra mechanisms and characterizations that are not in the expected answer counts as making up facts not supported by the context being evaluated against. Therefore, even though there is one partially matching idea (seeking discounts), the answer is not just incomplete; it overreaches with additional, unsupported specifics. This falls under \"hallucinated information\" and \"makes up facts not supported by the context,\" which maps to INCORRECT rather than merely partial.",

These groups were described as **continuing to spend on travel, events, and luxury services**, even as broader tourism and consumer outlays lost some momentum.\n\n• **Through the middle of the period**  \n  While several districts noted **slower travel demand** and **lower travel‑related retail spending** in certain areas, there was **no indication of a pullback** among upper‑income customers or corporate clients in the evidence reviewed. Instead, their spending on travel and luxury services remained **comparatively resilient**, helping to support the higher‑end segment of the market despite the softening in overall demand.\n\n• **By the end of the most recent Beige Book period (latest observations)**  \n  Conditions in tourism and consumer spending overall were still characterized as **slightly weaker or mixed**, with no quantified rates of decline. Within that context, upper‑income households and corporate clients were still reported as **actively spending on travel, events, and luxury services**, indicating that their luxury‑oriented travel spending **held up over the period** rather than following the broader slowdown.\n\nTemporal caveats:\n- The Beige Book passages do **not** provide precise dates, numerical growth rates, or explicit month‑over‑month / year‑over‑year comparisons for luxury travel spending. The references apply to the **latest reporting period covered by the most recent Beige Book**, and they describe conditions **qualitatively over that span**, not at exact calendar dates.\n- The evidence does **not** break out “luxury leisure travel” as a separate category; instead, it refers more generally to **travel, events, and luxury services** purchased by **upper‑income households and corporate clients** over the course of the period.",

There are no contradictions with the expected answer, and no factual errors relative to it. The extra temporal detail and caveats are consistent and do not undermine the core message.\n\nThus all key facts from the expected answer are present and correctly reflected: spending was strong/held up for higher‑income individuals in luxury travel and related accommodations/services.",

[BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]  \n  - This language indicates a **continued, sequential weakening** compared with immediately preceding reports, rather than a one‑time drop.  \n  - At the same time, **domestic consumer demand** for leisure and hospitality services was reported as **largely unchanged**, highlighting that the decline was **specific to international travelers** rather than to all travelers.\n\nIn temporal terms, the pattern is: earlier softness among international travelers, followed by a **further decline in demand in the period leading up to mid‑October 2025**, while domestic demand remained stable.",

There are no factual contradictions with the expected answer. The central fact is correctly captured and clearly expressed.\n\nTherefore the answer is fully correct, not merely partial, and it is not an abstention or incorrect.\n",

      "expected_answer": "Demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged.",
      "system_answer": "Over the period covered by the October 15, 2025 Beige Book (based on information collected on or before October 6, 2025), demand from domestic consumers for leisure and hospitality evolved as follows:\n\n**Up to October 6, 2025 (reporting period for the October 15, 2025 Beige Book)**\n\n- **Overall national picture (change since the prior Beige Book)**  \n  - At a high level, domestic consumer demand for leisure and hospitality was described as **largely unchanged**, implying **no clear nationwide increase or decrease** in aggregate demand over this reporting interval. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - This “largely unchanged” national characterization masks **meaningful regional and sectoral variation**, with some areas weakening and others holding steady or improving.\n\n- **New York District (through October 6, 2025)**  \n  - In New York, service‑sector activity continued to **decline moderately**, and firms in **retail, leisure, and hospitality** reported **moderate declines** in activity.  \n  - This indicates that, compared with the prior reporting period, **domestic leisure and hospitality demand in this district moved down**, contributing to softness in the sector. [BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Services]\n\n- **Dallas District (through October 6, 2025)**  \n  - Overall **nonfinancial services activity contracted slightly** in Dallas, with **leisure and hospitality exhibiting weakness** relative to the previous report. [BeigeBook_20251015, Dallas > Nonfinancial Services]\n  - At the same time, **airlines in the district reported broad‑based increases in passenger demand**, noting **domestic travel as a key source of strength**. This suggests that, within the broader leisure and hospitality category, **domestic air‑travel demand was rising even as other leisure/hospitality segments weakened.** [BeigeBook_20251015, Dallas > Nonfinancial Services]\n\n- **Chicago District (through October 6, 2025)**  \n  - Leisure and hospitality sales were reported as **mixed** over the period. [BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago > Consumer Spending]\n    - There was **softness in travel‑related categories**, including **airlines and hotels**, indicating a **decline or weakening** in those segments compared with the prior period.  \n    - In contrast, **spending increased at restaurants**, particularly in **fast food, fast casual, and family dining**, signaling **rising demand for lower‑ to mid‑priced dining options** within the leisure and hospitality sector.\n  - Net effect: within this reporting window, **some leisure/hospitality components in Chicago weakened (travel, hotels, some airlines) while others strengthened (certain restaurant categories).**\n\n**Synthesis over the reporting window (relative to the prior Beige Book)**\n\n- **Nationwide**, the Beige Book’s summary characterization is that **domestic leisure and hospitality demand was largely unchanged overall**, meaning that on balance the sector did not show a clear aggregate increase or decrease between the prior report and the October 15, 2025 report. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Over the same time span**, however, district‑level details show that:\n  - Some regions (e.g., **New York**, parts of **Dallas**) experienced **moderate declines or weakness** in leisure and hospitality demand.\n  - Some segments (e.g., **domestic air travel in Dallas**, **fast food/fast casual/family dining in Chicago**) saw **increases in demand**.\n  - Other segments (e.g., **hotels and certain airline categories in Chicago**) experienced **softening demand**.\n\nIn temporal terms, therefore, **between the previous Beige Book and October 6, 2025**, domestic consumer demand for leisure and hospitality **did not shift dramatically at the national level (largely unchanged)**, but **within that stable aggregate picture the composition changed**, with **travel‑related categories softening in several areas and some restaurant and domestic‑travel niches strengthening.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact from the expected answer: demand from domestic consumers for leisure and hospitality was largely unchanged. \n\nThe system answer explicitly states multiple times that “domestic consumer demand for leisure and hospitality was described as largely unchanged” at the national level and reiterates in the synthesis that nationwide demand “was largely unchanged overall.” This matches the ground truth. \n\nThe rest of the answer adds regional and sectoral detail (New York, Dallas, Chicago) but does not contradict the key national characterization; it frames those as variations within an overall unchanged aggregate. There are no factual contradictions with the expected answer, just additional, consistent elaboration. Thus it is fully correct relative to the expected answer.",

      "question": "What were the conditions in manufacturing according to the October 2025 Beige Book?",
      "expected_answer": "Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand.",
      "system_answer": "According to the October 15, 2025 Beige Book, U.S. manufacturing conditions were generally weak and uneven across Federal Reserve Districts, with significant headwinds from tariffs, softer demand, and elevated costs.\n\n• **Overall national picture** – The National Summary reported that manufacturing activity **“varied by District”**, and that **most District reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand**. [BeigeBook_20251015, Nat. Summary; Sub-Query 1, 2]\n\n• **Level of activity by District (where specified)**  \n  - **Boston (First District):** Manufacturing sales **rose modestly on average** since the prior report, but contacts cited outlook headwinds from **tariffs, inflation, and uncertainty**. [Chunk 2; Sub-Query 2]  \n  - **New York (Second District):** Manufacturing activity was **“little changed”** after a summer uptick; **new orders were down** and some firms reported weaker overseas demand. Manufacturers faced **elevated input prices**, some difficulty procuring equipment and materials, and persistent **tariff-related uncertainty**. [Chunk 8; Sub-Query 2]  \n  - **Philadelphia (Third District):** In the national “Highlights by District,” **manufacturing activity was reported to have increased moderately**. Locally, 46% of surveyed firms said third-quarter production rose versus the prior quarter—**the highest share in over a year**—and there were reports of **tariff‑related onshoring**. [Chunks 1, 5; Sub-Query 2]\n  - **Atlanta (Sixth District):** **District manufacturing rose slightly, on net**, with mixed outcomes by subsector. Producers of packaged snack products reported **considerably lower sales volumes amid softer consumer demand**, and tire-component orders were “lackluster.” Contacts remained concerned about **tariffs and rising costs**. [Chunk 7; Sub-Query 2]\n  - **Kansas City (Tenth District):** **Manufacturing activity increased slightly** over the reporting period, helped in part by **clearer market expectations from tariffs**. Even so, **high input costs** remained a major burden, though one contact said raw material costs had cooled from a “boil to a simmer.” [Chunk 6; Sub-Query 2]\n\n  For other Districts (Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, San Francisco), the supplied excerpts do not give a full quantitative classification (increase/flat/decline) for manufacturing activity, though some qualitative detail is available for Richmond and Dallas subsectors (see below). [Sub-Query 2, 3]\n\n• **Demand and tariff conditions**  \n  - Nationally, the Beige Book linked manufacturing challenges to **“higher tariffs and waning overall demand.”** [Chunk 4; Sub-Query 2]  \n  - **Tariff headwinds** were explicitly mentioned in Boston, New York, Atlanta, and Kansas City; Philadelphia reported **tariff‑related onshoring**. [Chunks 2, 5–8; Sub-Query 2]  \n  - **Demand softness** showed up in weaker overseas demand for some New York manufacturers and **softer consumer demand** for certain Atlanta products (e.g., packaged snacks), consistent with the national description of “waning overall demand.” [Chunks 7–8; Sub-Query 2]\n\n• **Costs, inputs, and supply availability**  \n  - Multiple Districts reported **elevated input costs** for manufacturers: New York cited **high steel prices** (including a keg maker that temporarily ceased production) and generally elevated input prices; Kansas City and Atlanta reported **high or rising input costs** as a key burden. [Chunks 6–8; Sub-Query 2]  \n  - **Supply availability** was not universally described as adequate: New York noted “some difficulty procuring equipment and materials” and that **supply availability worsened**, even though delivery times were little changed. [Chunk 8; Sub-Query 2]  \n  - The provided evidence does **not** clearly document a broad increase in excess capacity; Philadelphia instead reported that uncertainty was constraining capacity utilization for over half of surveyed firms, without explicitly stating that excess capacity had risen. [Chunk 5; Sub-Query 2]\n\n• **Subsector details and regional nuances**  \n  - **Richmond District:** Weakness was concentrated in **construction‑ and furniture‑related manufacturing**, reflecting the **depressed housing market, heightened customer price sensitivity, and tariffs that raised furniture prices** and compounded operational challenges. [Sub-Query 3]\n  - **Dallas District:** Conditions were mixed across subsectors as factory output growth slowed overall:  \n    • Among **durables**, **machinery and transportation equipment manufacturing** were relative bright spots.  \n    • Among **nondurables**, **food manufacturing posted strong gains**; **chemical production was flat** under pressure from trade policy and global oversupply; **Gulf Coast refineries** reported **lower output due to seasonality and unplanned outages**, despite strong margins for diesel and jet fuel. [Sub-Query 3]\n\nIn sum, the October 2025 Beige Book depicted manufacturing as **patchy and generally soft**, with modest gains in some Districts (e.g., Philadelphia, Boston, Atlanta, Kansas City), flat activity in at least one (New York), and notable subsectoral weakness (e.g., Richmond construction/furniture, some Dallas energy‑related output). Across regions, manufacturers commonly reported **tariff‑related uncertainty, elevated input costs, and softening demand** as key constraints. [BeigeBook_20251015; Sub-Query 1–3]",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The expected answer is short and contains two key points: (1) manufacturing activity \"varied by District\" and (2) most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. The system answer includes these exact elements in its overall national picture section: it explicitly quotes that manufacturing activity \"varied by District\" and that \"most District reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand.\" It then elaborates with additional district-level details and context that are consistent with, and do not contradict, the ground truth. There are no factual contradictions relative to the expected answer; the extra detail is just expansion, not error. Therefore all key facts are present and correct.",

      "question": "What drove manufacturing demand in the Chicago District?",
      "expected_answer": "Manufacturing demand declined modestly in late August and September. Steel orders were flat overall. Fabricated metals demand was unchanged on balance, as higher sales to a range of sectors was offset by lower sales to the construction and automotive industries. Machinery orders decreased moderately, driven by a decline in demand from the auto sector. Auto production was down modestly, while heavy truck production was flat.",
      "system_answer": "The available evidence does **not** provide information on what drove manufacturing demand in the **Chicago District** for the period in question. Instead, the cited Beige Book excerpts clearly pertain to the **Boston District**, and any identified demand drivers apply only to Boston, not Chicago.\n\nCause–effect relationships that **can** be described from the evidence are:\n\n1. **District mismatch (cause) → No valid Chicago-specific drivers (effect)**  \n   - The manufacturing passage we have is explicitly from the **Federal Reserve Bank of Boston – “Manufacturing and Related Services”** in the October 15, 2025 Beige Book.  \n   - This was caused by the fact that the excerpt is labeled and organized under Boston’s section, not Chicago’s.  \n   - **As a result**, any demand drivers cited there (e.g., particular customer segments) **cannot be attributed to the Chicago District**. We therefore cannot state, from this evidence, what drove manufacturing demand in Chicago.\n\n2. **Boston’s specific customer segments (cause) → Increased manufacturing demand in Boston (effect)**  \n   - In the Boston District, the Beige Book reports that “manufacturing sales rose modestly” and that **“various contacts reported increased demand coming from medical, retail, wholesale, and/or restaurant market segments.”**  \n   - This was caused by stronger orders or activity in these four market segments:  \n     • medical  \n     • retail  \n     • wholesale  \n     • restaurant  \n   - **As a result**, Boston-area manufacturers experienced modestly higher sales and reported these sectors as the main sources of increased demand.\n\n3. **Evidence gap for Chicago (cause) → Inability to identify Chicago manufacturing demand drivers (effect)**  \n   - The provided Beige Book excerpts do not include the **Chicago District’s manufacturing section** or any Chicago-specific commentary on manufacturing.  \n   - This lack of Chicago text is what causes the information gap.  \n   - **As a result**, we cannot specify which customer industries, markets, or groups drove manufacturing demand in the Chicago District using the evidence at hand.\n\nIn summary, the factors driving manufacturing demand that we can see (medical, retail, wholesale, restaurant sectors) are clearly documented only for the **Boston District**. Because no Chicago District manufacturing text is provided, the specific causes of manufacturing demand in the Chicago District **cannot be determined from this evidence.**",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth specifies concrete information about Chicago manufacturing: demand declined modestly; steel orders flat; fabricated metals unchanged with sectoral offsets; machinery orders decreased due to auto sector; auto production down modestly; heavy truck production flat. The system answer instead claims that the available evidence does not provide information on Chicago and that the excerpts only pertain to Boston, concluding it cannot state what drove manufacturing demand in Chicago. This directly contradicts the expected answer, which clearly provides Chicago-specific manufacturing details. The system is not merely abstaining; it asserts a (false) meta-claim about the absence of Chicago information and discusses Boston instead. Therefore it is factually wrong relative to the expected answer, not just incomplete or abstaining.",

      "question": "What challenges did manufacturers face regarding tariff policies?",
      "expected_answer": "Several manufacturers noted that changing tariff policies were making it difficult to plan for the future.",
      "system_answer": "Manufacturers faced several concrete challenges from tariff policies, centered on higher costs, weaker demand, and planning difficulties:\n\n1. **Sharp increases and volatility in input costs**  \n   - Tariffs raised prices on key nonlabor inputs, especially **steel, aluminum, metals, chemicals, semiconductor chips, imported components, and other raw materials**. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - Some firms experienced such large steel cost increases that they **temporarily shut down production**—for example, a keg manufacturer in upstate New York halted operations because steel prices became prohibitively high. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. **Squeezed margins and difficult pricing decisions**  \n   - Many manufacturers responded to tariff‑driven cost increases by adding **surcharges or raising output prices** to cover higher input costs. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - Others—especially **auto producers and firms already facing weak demand**—absorbed part of the higher costs or kept prices steady to avoid losing customers, which **compressed profit margins** and weakened competitiveness. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - Smaller firms or those with stronger pricing power passed through most or all of the cost increases, protecting margins but **eroding price competitiveness** as customers became more price sensitive and some foreign producers cut prices to maintain market share. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n3. **Weaker demand and lost sales**  \n   - Tariffs and related uncertainty contributed to **flat or declining orders**, both in the U.S. and abroad. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - Manufacturers reported **reduced overseas orders**, including industrial and agricultural equipment makers who saw orders **about 25% below expectations**. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - Auto manufacturers were described as **“feeling the pinch”** on new car sales. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - With customers more price sensitive, some firms could not fully pass on higher costs without **losing market share**. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n4. **Operational and planning challenges**  \n   - Tariff‑driven cost swings forced firms to repeatedly **reconfigure products, adjust pricing strategies, or absorb costs**, making production planning more complex. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - A specialty appliance maker, for example, had to **raise prices multiple times in a single year** because of tariff‑related cost increases. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - Firms tightened **investment criteria** and in some cases **delayed or reconsidered capital spending**, citing tariff uncertainty and higher input costs. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - Companies also warned that as **inventories of pre‑tariff goods dwindled**, it would become harder to shield customers from further price increases. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n5. **Policy uncertainty and administrative problems**  \n   - Uncertainty about the **scope, duration, and future direction** of tariffs complicated long‑term planning and pricing. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - Some firms reported **misapplication or opacity** in tariff rules—for instance, a computer manufacturer said **steel and aluminum tariffs were applied to products that did not contain those metals**. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - Other manufacturers observed that certain suppliers used tariffs as a **pretext to raise prices** even when their goods were not directly subject to higher duties, further inflating costs. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nOverall, tariff policies increased and destabilized manufacturers’ input costs, pressured margins and competitiveness, reduced or flattened demand (with some sectors like industrial/agricultural equipment seeing orders roughly **25% below expectations**), and created planning and administrative difficulties that led to production disruptions and more cautious investment. [BeigeBook_20251015]",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The expected answer is narrow: manufacturers noted that changing tariff policies made it difficult to plan for the future. The key element is “difficulty planning for the future” due to “changing tariff policies.”\n\nThe system answer includes that point under section 4 and 5: it talks about “operational and planning challenges,” “production planning more complex,” “tightened investment criteria,” “delayed or reconsidered capital spending,” and “uncertainty about the scope, duration, and future direction of tariffs complicated long-term planning and pricing.” That captures the core idea from the ground truth: planning for the future was difficult due to changing/uncertain tariff policies.\n\nThe rest of the system answer adds many additional challenges (higher costs, weaker demand, margins, etc.) that are not in the ground truth. However, those additions are not stated to be false relative to the context; we are not told they contradict anything. The question is specifically “What challenges did manufacturers face regarding tariff policies?” so elaborating on other tariff-related challenges is not inherently wrong. There is no factual contradiction with the expected answer, and the key idea about planning difficulty from changing/uncertain tariffs is clearly present.\n\nTherefore the answer is complete with respect to the ground truth and not misleading; it is just more detailed.\n",

      "expected_answer": "Employment levels were largely stable in recent weeks, and demand for labor was generally muted across Districts and sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Over the period covered in the October 15, 2025 Beige Book report, employment levels were described as largely *stable* rather than moving in a clear upward or downward trajectory.\n\nChronologically, the pattern over the latest reporting period (the weeks immediately preceding October 15, 2025) can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **Early in the reporting period (late summer 2025):**\n  - Across most Federal Reserve Districts, firms reported employment as **“flat,” “unchanged,” or “little changed”** compared with the prior period, indicating no broad-based surge or collapse in hiring.\n  - Any changes that did occur were modest and localized—some sectors or regions added a small number of workers, while others trimmed staff slightly. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Mid-period developments (as the reporting window progressed):**\n  - The overall national picture remained one of **stable headcounts with limited net hiring**. Employers in many districts appeared cautious: they were not engaging in large expansions, but they were also generally not making large layoffs.\n  - The tone in district narratives continued to emphasize **“stable,” “unchanged,” or “flat”** employment rather than any sharp move up or down. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Late in the reporting period (just before October 15, 2025):**\n  - As conditions were summarized in the national section and across districts, the overall assessment was that employment was **largely flat with a slightly softening bias**—that is, some districts noted **slight declines** in employment, while others reported **slight increases**, but there was no strong directional shift.\n  - Examples of this localized variation include **slightly falling employment in the Kansas City District** and a **slight increase in employment in the Philadelphia District**, set against a backdrop of generally unchanged employment elsewhere. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\nOverall, over the full reporting window leading up to October 15, 2025, the temporal pattern in employment levels was one of **stability with mild softening at the margin**, not a pronounced trend of steady growth or sharp decline, and with no indication of strong volatility.\n",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Employment levels were largely stable in recent weeks.\n2) Demand for labor was generally muted across Districts and sectors.\n\nSystem answer:\n- Clearly states that employment levels were “largely stable,” “flat,” “unchanged,” with only modest, localized changes, no strong upward or downward trajectory, and “stability with mild softening at the margin.” This fully aligns with key fact (1).\n- It does not explicitly mention that demand for labor was generally muted across Districts and sectors. It focuses on employment levels and hiring/layoff behavior, but never characterizes labor demand as muted or generally weak in a way that clearly covers Districts and sectors. So key fact (2) is missing.\n- There are no factual contradictions with the ground truth and no evident hallucinations that conflict with it; the extra details are consistent with the idea of stability.\n\nBecause the answer accurately captures the stability of employment levels but omits the point about generally muted labor demand, it is incomplete but not incorrect or misleading with respect to what it does say.",

[BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Maintaining profitability under softer demand**\n  - Some firms said they implemented **modest layoffs and headcount reductions** specifically to preserve or improve profitability when demand eased slightly. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Increased investment in AI technologies**\n  - In several Districts, employers tied current or anticipated staff reductions to **increased investment in AI and generative AI**, which reduced labor needs or was expected to do so if demand weakened further.

      "expected_answer": "Employers that reported hiring generally noted improved labor availability, and some favored hiring temporary and part-time workers over offering full-time employment opportunities.",
      "system_answer": "From earlier, more expansionary conditions to the most recent report, employers’ hiring preferences moved along a clear timeline from growth and straightforward full‑time hiring toward caution, selectivity, and flexible staffing.\n\n**Before the recent shift (earlier Beige Book rounds, pre‑mid‑2025)**  \n(The Beige Book compares each report to the immediately preceding one and is issued eight times per year, but the specific prior month/round is not named in the Oct. 15, 2025 issue.) [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Employers were generally focused on **maintaining or expanding staff levels** rather than cutting headcount.\n- Hiring was more commonly for **direct, permanent full‑time roles**, including entry‑level positions, and vacancies were more likely to be filled relatively promptly.\n- With tighter labor markets and more job switching, firms tended to be **less selective** and more willing to hire a range of candidates to meet staffing needs.  \n  *(These patterns describe conditions before the shift; the Oct. 15, 2025 Beige Book itself mainly documents the new, more cautious stance rather than the earlier one.)*\n\n**Leading into 2025: gradual move away from expansionary hiring**  \nAs demand softened and uncertainty increased in the run‑up to the Oct. 15, 2025 report, hiring preferences began to adjust:\n- Employers in many Districts started to **slow or pause expansionary hiring**, becoming more deliberate about backfilling roles.\n- Reports pointed to **weaker demand and elevated uncertainty**, which set the stage for more conservative staffing plans.\n- Some employers began experimenting more with **temporary and part‑time arrangements**, laying groundwork for the stronger shift documented later. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**By October 15, 2025 (current preferences documented in the Beige Book dated 2025‑10‑15)**  \nIn the period covered by the October 15, 2025 Beige Book, hiring preferences had clearly pivoted away from growth and toward restraint and flexibility:\n\n- **Shift from expansion to replacement‑only hiring (2025)**  \n  - Across Federal Reserve Districts, many employers moved to **replacement‑only or minimal hiring**, often filling positions only when someone left, and even then more selectively. \n  - Some organizations—especially nonprofits and certain other sectors—**left vacancies open** rather than filling them, further signaling caution. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Headcount reduction and cautious staffing (2025)**  \n  - Instead of expanding, numerous firms **held headcount flat or reduced it** through layoffs and attrition.\n  - Weaker demand and uncertainty were cited as reasons for this pullback in hiring appetite. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Preference for flexible arrangements over full‑time hires (2025)**  \n  - Employers increasingly favored **temporary, part‑time, temp‑to‑hire, or short‑term project roles** rather than immediately committing to permanent full‑time positions. \n  - Jobseekers more often encountered **part‑time offers with limited benefits**, indicating a clear preference on the employer side for flexibility and lower fixed labor costs. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Impact of AI and reduced need for entry‑level roles (2025)**  \n  - Some firms paired **workforce reductions with investments in AI**, specifically reducing their dependence on **entry‑level and less‑experienced workers**.\n  - This led to **diminished appetite for entry‑level hiring** and reinforced the focus on retaining and hiring more experienced staff. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Greater selectivity and emphasis on retention (2025)**  \n  - With **more applicants per opening** and lower turnover, employers became **more selective** about whom they hire.\n  - Many prioritized **retention of experienced workers**, preferring to keep existing talent rather than expand aggressively or take chances on less‑experienced candidates. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Overall evolution of hiring preferences over time**  \n- **Earlier period (pre‑shift):** More straightforward, expansion‑oriented hiring; preference for direct full‑time roles, including entry‑level, and relatively less selectivity.\n- **Transition period into 2025:** Growing uncertainty and softer demand pushed employers to slow expansion, become more deliberate about backfilling, and test more flexible staffing models.\n- **By Oct. 15, 2025:** Hiring preferences had clearly shifted toward **restraint**, **replacement‑only or minimal hiring**, **greater selectivity**, and a strong tilt toward **temporary/part‑time or temp‑to‑hire arrangements**, combined with **reduced entry‑level hiring** and **greater reliance on AI** and experienced staff. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nThis chronology shows a movement from growth‑oriented, full‑time hiring toward a more cautious, flexible, and selective approach, culminating in the patterns observed in the October 15, 2025 Beige Book.\n",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Among employers that were hiring, labor availability had improved.\n2) Some employers preferred temporary and part‑time workers instead of offering full‑time employment opportunities.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer does state a preference \"for flexible arrangements over full‑time hires\" and details \"temporary, part‑time, temp‑to‑hire\" roles and a \"strong tilt toward temporary/part‑time or temp‑to‑hire arrangements.\" This aligns with key fact (2).\n- However, it never mentions that employers who were hiring \"generally noted improved labor availability,\" nor does it refer to labor availability improving at all. That key idea is missing.\n- The bulk of the system answer adds many dynamics (AI, reduced entry‑level roles, replacement‑only hiring, etc.) that are not in the ground truth; while these are not obviously contradictory, they go well beyond the simple expected answer. The important point is that the system answer omits the improvement in labor availability, one of only two main points in the ground truth.\n\nThus, the answer captures only part of what was expected, without clear factual errors relative to the ground truth, making it incomplete but not misleading on the overlapping point about increased use of temporary/part‑time hiring.\n",

[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**District-by-district comparison**  \n- **Atlanta (Sixth District)** vs **New York (Second District)**  \n  - In Atlanta, wages grew **modestly**, indicating steady but not strong upward pressure on pay. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]  \n  - In New York, wage growth also remained **modest**, essentially matching Atlanta’s pace and character. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Atlanta & New York** vs **Dallas (Eleventh District)**  \n  - Atlanta and New York both reported **modest** wage growth.  \n  - In Dallas, wage growth was likewise described as **modest**, putting all three districts in the same wage-growth category with very similar conditions. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **San Francisco (Twelfth District)** vs other “modest” districts (Atlanta, New York, Dallas)  \n  - In San Francisco, wages grew **slightly**, which is consistent with **modest** gains and suggests a similar, subdued pace of wage increases. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]  \n  - Compared with Atlanta, New York, and Dallas, San Francisco’s description implies no stronger or weaker trend—just small, incremental wage increases.\n\n- **Richmond (Fifth District)** vs Minneapolis (Ninth District)**  \n  - In Richmond, wage growth remained **moderate**, pointing to a somewhat firmer pace than strictly “modest” districts, though still not rapid. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]  \n  - In Minneapolis, wage growth was also **moderate**, aligning closely with Richmond’s experience.

[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]  \n  - In comparison, Richmond and Minneapolis appear to be experiencing **somewhat faster wage gains** than the modest-growth districts, but still within the overall national band of modest to moderate.\n\n**Summary comparison**  \n- No district stands out with either **declining** wages or **rapid** wage acceleration.  \n- Most districts (Atlanta, New York, Dallas, San Francisco) are in the **modest/slight** category.  \n- A smaller group (Richmond, Minneapolis) sits at the **moderate** end, implying marginally stronger wage growth but still consistent with the national description of modest-to-moderate increases.

      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the expected answer: (1) Wages grew across all reporting districts; (2) The pace was generally modest to moderate. \n\nThe system answer states: \"Nationally, wages grew across all reporting districts at a generally modest to moderate pace\" and reiterates that wage growth was in a \"modest to moderate\" range, with no declines or rapid acceleration. These match both key elements of the ground truth precisely. The additional district-by-district elaboration is consistent with and does not contradict the expected answer. There are no factual errors relative to the brief ground truth; the system just adds more (still aligned) detail. Thus it fully satisfies the expected answer.\n",

      "expected_answer": "Labor cost pressures intensified in recent weeks due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses.",
      "system_answer": "Labor cost pressures intensified through several linked cause-and-effect channels:\n\n1. **Rising non-wage benefit costs → Higher per‑employee labor costs**  \n   - This was caused by **“outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses” at the national level**. Firms reported that what they pay for employees’ health insurance rose sharply, even where base wages were increasing only modestly.  \n   - As a result, **overall compensation per worker increased**, raising labor cost pressures even in sectors that were not seeing strong wage growth. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. **Tighter labor supply (especially due to immigration-related factors) → Need to pay more to attract workers**  \n   - This was caused by **reduced labor availability linked to immigration-policy-related fears of deportation and immigration enforcement**. These fears discouraged some workers—particularly in sectors that rely heavily on immigrant labor—from participating in the labor market.  \n   - As a result, the **effective labor pool shrank** in sectors such as **construction and agriculture**, and in specific regions (e.g., a construction firm in Memphis). Employers in these sectors had to **raise wages and improve compensation** to attract and retain workers.  \n   - This, in turn, **pushed labor costs higher** and contributed to **project delays**, since firms sometimes could not find enough workers even at higher pay levels. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n3. **Sector-specific wage pressures (competition and union negotiations) → Localized increases in labor costs**  \n   - In some industries, **persistent competition for certain roles** and the outcomes of **union contract negotiations** (for example, in **health care**) led to **wage increases for those positions**.  \n   - As a result, even where broader wage pressures were softening, these **targeted pay increases** added to overall labor cost pressures in the affected sectors and occupations. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nPutting these together:  \n- **Higher benefit costs** directly raised compensation per worker;  \n- **Reduced labor supply**, partly driven by **immigration-policy-related fears**, forced firms to bid up wages; and  \n- **Sector-specific competition and union settlements** added localized wage increases.  \n\nCollectively, these mechanisms **intensified labor cost pressures**, as employers faced rising total compensation costs from both non-wage benefits and wage increases necessitated by tighter labor markets and sector-specific dynamics.

      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the expected answer:\n- Labor cost pressures intensified **due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses**.\n\nCheck system answer:\n- It explicitly states in point 1: “This was caused by ‘outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses’ at the national level.”\n- It correctly links this to rising non-wage benefit costs and higher per‑employee labor costs, which is consistent with the expected answer.\n\nHowever, the system answer goes far beyond this and adds multiple other asserted drivers: tighter labor supply due to immigration-related factors, sector-specific wage pressures, union negotiations, etc. The question is specifically “What drove labor cost pressures to intensify?” and the ground truth gives a single driver: health insurance expenses. The added mechanisms are not in the expected answer and are presented as factual causes. Since we must judge against the provided ground truth, these extra causes are unsupported and change the causal explanation.\n\nThus, while the key fact is present, the answer introduces additional causal factors not in the ground truth, making the overall explanation inconsistent with the expected one.

      "question": "What happened to prices during the October 2025 reporting period?",
      "expected_answer": "Prices rose further during the reporting period.",
      "system_answer": "During the October 2025 reporting period, prices followed a generally upward path, with modest to moderate increases rather than declines or flat readings. Chronologically, the evolution over the period can be summarized as follows:\n\n**Early in the reporting period (late summer into early fall 2025, leading into October 15, 2025)**  \n- Across the Federal Reserve Districts, prices **continued the rising trend seen earlier in 2025**, rather than starting a new acceleration or a reversal.  \n- The national summary described prices as having **“rose further”** during this period, indicating a continuation of prior inflation rather than a new downturn.  \n- Price pressures at this stage were already being shaped by **higher import and tariff‑related input costs**, particularly for **raw materials, metals, food, and services** (including insurance and utilities). Firms were beginning or continuing to pass some of these higher costs through to customers. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Throughout the October 2025 reporting window (up to the October 15, 2025 Beige Book release)**  \n- **Overall direction:** Prices **increased further nationwide**. Multiple Federal Reserve Districts (San Francisco, Cleveland, Kansas City, St. Louis, Philadelphia, New York, Richmond) reported **modest to moderate price growth**, not declines or flat prices. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Character of the change:**  \n  - The pace of increases was generally described as **modest to moderate**, similar to earlier in the year, rather than sharp or rapid.  \n  - In some regions and sectors, the **pace of price increases remained elevated** even as underlying demand softened, indicating that cost pressures, not just demand, were keeping prices up. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Sector detail and firm behavior:**  \n  - Input costs rose notably for **raw materials, metals, food, insurance, and utilities**, reflecting both **import costs and tariff effects**.  \n  - Many businesses **partially passed these higher costs on** through higher selling prices, contributing to continued inflation at the producer and consumer levels.  \n  - At the same time, some firms, facing **weaker demand and customer resistance**, **kept list prices steady or used discounts and promotions**, which tempered how much of the input-cost increase reached final consumer prices. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**By the end of the reporting period (around mid‑October 2025)**  \n- **Producer and consumer prices were higher than at the start of the period**, with the national summary emphasizing that they had **“increased further”** over the reporting window.  \n- The **broad pattern** by mid‑October was:  \n  - Persistent but **not accelerating** inflation in most regions (still modest to moderate).  \n  - Some localized pockets of **stable prices or discounting**, where businesses chose margin compression rather than additional price hikes.  \n  - Ongoing **cost‑push pressures** from imports, tariffs, and services keeping overall price levels on an upward trajectory. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nIn short, over the October 2025 reporting period (culminating in the October 15, 2025 Beige Book), prices moved **steadily higher over time**, with modest to moderate inflation continuing across most areas and sectors, driven mainly by elevated input and service costs, even as some firms attempted to restrain final selling prices in response to softer demand and customer pushback.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the expected answer: Prices rose further during the reporting period.\n\nSystem answer: States multiple times that prices followed an upward path, \"continued the rising trend,\" \"rose further,\" \"increased further nationwide,\" and that producer and consumer prices were higher by the end of the period. This clearly matches the core fact that prices rose further during the reporting period. There are many additional details (modest to moderate, sector specifics, cost pressures) but none contradict the ground truth. No factual errors relative to the simple expected statement.\n\nTherefore, all key information is present and consistent, with extra but compatible elaboration.",

As a result, businesses that rely on imported materials and components faced higher bills, pushing up their total input costs even when some domestic material prices (such as certain steels and lumber) were declining in specific regions. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Rising prices for key services → Additional input cost pressure**  \n  Input costs also accelerated because the **prices of essential services**—including **insurance, health care, and technology solutions**—increased at a faster rate. This was caused by broad-based price hikes in these service categories, which are critical operating inputs for many firms. As a result, even firms not heavily exposed to imported goods still saw their overall input costs rise more quickly.\n\n- **Combined effect → Accelerating input cost inflation**  \n  The combination of tariff‑driven import cost increases and faster growth in service prices **added to overall input cost inflation**, causing input costs to rise at an accelerating pace across many Districts, despite some localized declines in certain raw material prices.

      "question": "How did tariffs affect prices across districts?",
      "expected_answer": "Tariff-induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts, but the extent of those higher costs passing through to final prices varied. Some firms kept selling prices unchanged to preserve market share, while others fully passed higher import costs to customers.",
      "system_answer": "Across districts, tariffs affected prices mainly by raising firms’ input costs, and those higher costs were then passed through to final prices in uneven, context‑dependent ways.\n\n1. Tariffs raised input costs in many districts\n- **Cause:** New and higher tariffs (or import duties) increased the cost of imported raw materials, components, and some finished goods.  \n- **Effect:** This pushed **input prices up across many Districts**, especially in sectors reliant on imported inputs such as manufacturing and parts of retail and food.  \n  - Nationally, districts reported “tariff‑induced input cost increases” driven by higher import costs. [National Summary > Prices]\n  - **San Francisco (Twelfth):** Higher import duties raised costs for imported supplies, including raw materials, electrical/electronic components, and food. [San Francisco > Prices]\n  - **Cleveland (Fourth), Philadelphia (Third), Chicago (Seventh), New York (Second), Richmond (Fifth):** All reported tariff‑related cost pressures on inputs such as metals, chemicals, vehicles, beef, coffee, chocolate, and other imported goods. [BeigeBook_20251015, cited district sections]\n\n2. Firms decided how much of these higher costs to pass on\nOnce tariffs raised input costs, firms chose among several strategies; these choices caused different price outcomes by district and sector.\n\nA. Cases where tariffs clearly raised selling prices\n- **Cause:** Firms faced higher tariff‑driven input costs and chose to pass them through.  \n- **Effect:** **Final prices increased**, sometimes fully and sometimes partially.\n  - **Nationally:** Some manufacturers and retailers “fully passed higher import costs along to their customers.” [National Summary > Prices]\n  - **New York (Second):**  \n    • A specialty appliance manufacturer twice raised prices “to account for the impact of tariffs on their costs.”  \n    • An upstate brewery passed higher ingredient and packaging costs on to consumers. [New York > Prices]  \n  - **San Francisco (Twelfth):** Retailers “passed a sizable portion” of tariff‑related cost increases to consumers, “mostly in the mid‑ to high‑end markets.” [San Francisco > Prices]  \n  - **Chicago (Seventh):** Some smaller retailers had already raised prices because of tariffs. [Chicago > Prices]\n  - **Richmond (Fifth):** “Price growth picked up somewhat in manufacturing, with firms citing tariffs,” so tariffs **caused faster manufacturing price increases**, even though overall year‑over‑year price growth remained moderate. [Richmond > Summary]\n\nAs a result, in these sectors and districts, tariffs directly contributed to **higher consumer or producer prices**, often characterized as modest or moderate overall but clearly upward.\n\nB. Cases of partial or delayed pass‑through\n- **Cause:** Tariffs raised costs, but firms either could not or chose not to pass them through immediately or fully (due to demand conditions, inventory, or strategy).  \n- **Effect:** **Price increases were smaller, delayed, or showed up in specific segments only.**\n  - **San Francisco (Twelfth):**  \n    • Many suppliers **absorbed some** of the tariff‑driven increases; retailers passed through a “sizable portion,” not all.  \n    • Restaurants facing higher ingredient costs plus falling traffic and strong resistance to higher menu prices **changed recipes or cut portion sizes** instead of fully raising list prices. [San Francisco > Prices]\n  - **Richmond (Fifth):** Some firms reported that tariffs were adding to input costs, but “some of which have yet to be passed along to customers”; a couple of firms planned to raise prices once they used up pre‑tariff inventory. This was caused by the buffer of cheaper inventory and the desire to smooth price increases. [Richmond > Prices]\n  - **Boston (First):** Smaller manufacturers “passed through a larger share” of tariff‑induced cost increases, implying only **partial** pass‑through; restaurants, by contrast, saw profitability decline while “menu prices were mostly unchanged,” meaning they absorbed costs. [Boston > Prices]\n  - **Atlanta (Sixth):** Firms reported a mix of “absorbing cost increases, negotiating with suppliers, and passing through to customers.” Contacts said tariff‑related price pass‑through “has just begun” and they **expect more prices to rise into 2026**, so current price effects are incomplete and will build over time. [Atlanta > Prices]\n\nAs a result, tariffs produced **moderate but not proportional** price increases in many places: input costs rose strongly, but final prices rose only modestly because firms split the burden with customers or postponed increases.\n\nC. Cases where tariffs raised costs but firms largely held prices steady\n- **Cause:** Firms feared losing market share, faced price‑sensitive customers, or were in highly competitive markets; this made them reluctant to raise prices despite higher costs.  \n- **Effect:** **Selling prices stayed mostly unchanged**, margins compressed, and firms used non‑price adjustments.\n  - **Nationally:** Some firms with tariff‑induced cost pressures “kept their selling prices largely unchanged to preserve market share and in response to pushback from price‑sensitive clients.” [National Summary > Prices]\n  - **Boston (First):** Restaurants did not significantly raise menu prices despite rising costs; this was caused by demand sensitivity, so the adjustment occurred through lower profitability instead of higher prices. [Boston > Prices]\n  - **Atlanta (Sixth):** Some auto manufacturers “were absorbing these [tariff] increases to prevent further declines in demand,” so tariffs raised their costs but **did not yet raise auto prices**. [Atlanta > Prices]\n  - **San Francisco (Twelfth):** Some restauranteurs refused to raise prices in the face of customer resistance, opting for smaller portions or different ingredients instead. [San Francisco > Prices]\n\nThus, in these districts and sectors, tariffs still put **upward pressure** on prices, but firms’ strategic choice to protect demand caused that pressure to show up more in squeezed margins than in posted prices.\n\n3. District differences in overall price outcomes\nBecause each district had a different mix of sectors, competitive conditions, and demand, the same tariff shock produced different price patterns:\n- **New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco, Richmond:** Reported **modest to moderate price increases overall**, even where input costs from tariffs rose “strongly” (e.g., New York). This was caused by partial pass‑through and cost absorption. [New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco, Richmond sections]\n- **Cleveland:** Nonlabor input costs rose at a “robust pace,” with tariffs “frequently cited” as drivers, causing strong cost pressure that likely pushed prices up, though the exact pass‑through is not quantified. [Cleveland > Prices]\n- **Atlanta and San Francisco (key materials):**  \n  • In the **Sixth District**, waning demand pushed **steel prices down**, even as tariffs affected other items.  \n  • In the **Twelfth District**, waning demand pushed **lumber prices down**.  \n  These declines were caused by weaker demand, not tariffs, and they **partly offset** tariff‑related upward pressure on other inputs. [National Summary > Prices]\n- **Other districts:** Some prices for construction inputs in Chicago were “unchanged” because sector‑specific demand and supply conditions muted tariff pass‑through in those categories. [Chicago > Prices]\n\n4. Net effect across districts\nPutting these cause‑and‑effect channels together:\n- Tariffs **caused input costs to rise across many districts**, especially for imported goods and materials.  \n- This **resulted in upward pressure on final prices**, but the actual price changes differed by district and sector because:\n  - Some firms (often in manufacturing and retail) chose or were able to **fully pass costs on**, raising prices more.  \n  - Many others **partially passed through** costs or delayed increases, leading to **moderate** price gains instead of sharp jumps.  \n  - A nontrivial share **held prices nearly flat**, causing tariffs to show up as reduced margins rather than higher prices, especially where customers were highly price‑sensitive.  \n  - In a few markets (e.g., Sixth‑District steel, Twelfth‑District lumber), **weak demand caused prices to flatten or fall**, offsetting some tariff‑related cost pressure.\n\nAs a result, the Beige Book portrays tariffs as exerting **moderate but uneven upward pressure on prices across districts**, operating primarily through higher input costs and shaped by local demand conditions and firms’ pass‑through decisions, rather than producing uniform or across‑the‑board price spikes.\n",

      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth states two key points: (1) tariffs raised input costs across many districts, and (2) the degree of pass‑through to final prices varied, with some firms keeping selling prices unchanged to preserve market share while others fully passed higher import costs to customers. The system answer captures both points clearly: it says tariffs mainly raised input costs and that pass‑through to final prices was “uneven, context‑dependent.” It then explicitly notes that some firms fully passed costs on and others absorbed them or held prices steady, preserving market share or margins. The answer adds more district‑specific detail, but this is consistent with and elaborates on the expected answer without contradiction.

The question asks: “Which materials saw price decreases and in which districts?” The system answer correctly includes those two (steel in Sixth; domestic lumber in Twelfth), but then adds multiple additional districts and materials/categories (Tenth construction materials; Seventh and Ninth agricultural commodities; Ninth retail fuel). These extra items are not in the expected answer and thus contradict what is considered correct for this question. That makes the system answer factually misaligned with the ground truth, not merely incomplete. Therefore it is incorrect rather than partially correct.",

      "question": "What were the conditions in residential and commercial real estate?",
      "expected_answer": "Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity.",
      "system_answer": "Residential real estate conditions were generally soft or flat across most Federal Reserve Districts, while commercial real estate was mixed but often flat to slightly improving, with important regional and sectoral differences.\n\n**Residential real estate**\n- Across many districts, residential markets were **softening or flat**, with weaker activity and more signs of cooling:\n  - Several districts reported **decreased or unchanged sales activity**, **longer time on market**, **rising inventories**, and/or **easing prices**, including San Francisco, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago (which shifted to being only “barely a seller’s market”). [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - New residential construction was **limited or slowing** in multiple areas as builders pulled back on new starts amid weaker demand and uncertainty; Chicago was an exception, with **a slight edge up in construction** and some builders still seeing strong new‑home demand. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Some regions remained relatively strong:\n  - In the **New York District**, the housing market **remained solid**, with **low inventory, strong demand, and continued upward pressure on prices**; desirable properties sold **quickly and often above asking price**. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - In **Boston (First District)**, single‑family closed sales were **flat or down slightly overall**, condo sales **increased slightly**, house prices **rose moderately year‑over‑year** (but more slowly than earlier), condo prices **fell modestly** in some areas, and inventories **increased sharply** from a year earlier. Contacts were hopeful that lower mortgage rates would help affordability and sales. [Boston Residential Real Estate]\n\n**Commercial real estate (CRE)**\n- Overall, CRE conditions were **mixed but often flat to slightly improving**, with notable differences by district and property type:\n  - **Boston (First District)**: Overall CRE activity was **up slightly net of seasonal factors**. Office leasing picked up after Labor Day, supported by several large deals; **office rents were flat**, but **operating costs continued to rise**. Retail leasing was **stable** with **modest rent growth** and **low vacancies**; industrial leasing and sales were **stable**. Multifamily rents **rose only slightly**, slower than earlier in the year, and new multifamily construction remained limited due to higher costs. [Boston CRE]\n  - **New York (Second District)**: CRE markets **continued to improve**. New York City’s office market was **stronger than many other large cities**, helped by a few large transactions. Industrial activity was **muted** amid uncertainty over interest rates and tariffs. Retail demand was **bifurcated**, with **luxury retail in Manhattan resilient** while other retail segments were weak. Construction activity, however, **continued to decline**. [New York Real Estate and Construction]\n  - **Dallas (Eleventh District)**: CRE activity **improved**. Office **leasing improved** with more signs of stability, though many tenants favored short‑term leases. Industrial and retail activity **remained solid**. Apartment demand was **steady**, but elevated new supply put **downward pressure on rents**. Investment sales activity **remained limited**. [Dallas Construction and Real Estate]\n- For other districts (such as Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco), the provided evidence does not give detailed CRE descriptions, so specific claims about their CRE trends (flat, improving, or declining) cannot be documented here.\n\nIn sum, residential real estate was generally cooling—more inventory, slower sales, and some price easing in many districts, with New York and parts of New England as notable exceptions—while commercial real estate showed modest improvement or stability in key districts like Boston, New York, and Dallas, with stronger conditions in selected office, industrial, and retail segments but continuing cost pressures and weak construction in some areas.

      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth states: conditions in residential and commercial real estate (as interest rate–sensitive sectors) were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while others highlighted muted activity. The key ideas: (1) overall “mixed” conditions, (2) link to interest‑rate sensitivity, (3) some improvement in lending due to lower rates, but (4) other reports still show muted activity.\n\nThe system answer instead gives a long, very specific description of residential and commercial real estate conditions: residential generally soft/flat, some regions strong; CRE mixed but flat to slightly improving, with regional variation. It does not mention interest‑rate sensitivity, does not mention business lending, and does not mention the contrast between “improved business lending due to lower interest rates” versus “continued muted activity.” It describes a different qualitative pattern (residential broadly cooling, CRE modestly improving) rather than simply saying “mixed” in the sense used in the ground truth, and introduces many details that are not in the expected answer. While some high‑level notion of “mixed” is implicitly present (strength in some regions, weakness in others), the specific key points about lending conditions and lower interest rates are entirely missing, and the answer is not aligned with the concise ground‑truth characterization. There are no explicit contradictions to the ground truth, but the answer does not capture most of the key facts that define the expected answer.\n\nBecause: (a) the main required elements (improved business lending tied to lower rates, yet still muted activity overall) are absent, and (b) the answer goes off with a different, unsupported narrative rather than being a partial subset of the ground truth, this is best classified as incorrect rather than merely incomplete.\n",

Positive effects of lower rates ↔ offset by tariffs, weak demand, and uncertainty\n- The incomplete translation of easier credit into broad‑based growth was **caused by countervailing headwinds**: higher tariffs, waning demand, and elevated economic uncertainty.\n- As a result, **manufacturing activity** in many Districts stayed weak even as rates fell: nationally, “most reports noted challenging conditions due to **higher tariffs and waning overall demand**.” [National Summary]\n- In **Cleveland manufacturing**, “several manufacturers continued to attribute flat or weaker orders to **import tariffs and persistent uncertainty about trade policy**.” [Cleveland > Manufacturing]\n- In **Cleveland financial services**, some bankers said that **persistent inflation and small upticks in unemployment created economic uncertainty that kept loan demand weak**, even with lower rates. [Cleveland > Financial Services]\n- As a result, when all sectors and regions are combined, overall economic activity “**changed little on balance**,” with only slight growth in some Districts and slight softening in others. [National Summary]\n\n5. Net causal picture\n- **Cause:** The Federal Reserve’s lower interest rates reduced borrowing costs.\n  - **Direct effects:**\n    - Encouraged households and businesses to take more loans (Cleveland, St. Louis).  \n    - Supported more capital spending by firms, including new commercial construction and capacity expansions (Cleveland, Arizona semiconductor projects).  \n    - Improved demand in interest‑rate‑sensitive industries like commercial and residential real estate and financial services.\n  \n- **Offsetting causes:** High tariffs, weak product demand, and elevated uncertainty about trade policy and the broader economy.\n  - **Offsetting effects:**\n    - Weaker or flat manufacturing orders despite cheaper credit.  \n    - Cautious business behavior (e.g., short‑term leases, limited investment sales, and only gradual rebuilding of small‑business loan pipelines).  \n\nAs a result, lower interest rates **did stimulate business activity through higher loan demand and more investment in certain sectors and regions**, but **the overall level of business activity remained roughly flat**, because tariffs and uncertainty significantly damped demand and tempered the full potential impact of the rate cuts.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the expected answer:\n1) Lower interest rates led to an uptick in demand in commercial construction.\n2) Lower interest rates led to an uptick in demand in financial services.\n3) Some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates.\n\nThe system answer states that lower interest rates lowered borrowing costs, encouraged more lending and investment, and explicitly mentions that interest‑rate‑sensitive sectors such as residential and commercial real estate and financial services saw “improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates.” It also notes that commercial construction and financial services contacts “noted an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates.” These directly match the core points of the expected answer. \n\nThe system answer adds extra causal context (tariffs and uncertainty partly offsetting effects), but this does not contradict the expected answer, and is supported in the longer ground truth explanation. There are no factual errors relative to the expected answer; all key points are present and consistent.\n\nTherefore the answer is fully correct, not just partial.\n",

      "system_answer": "Over the most recent Beige Book reporting period, financial conditions in the Chicago (Seventh) District evolved as follows, with the key changes occurring in **late August and September 2025**.\n\n**Late August–September 2025 (reporting period for the 2025-10-15 Beige Book)**  \n- **Overall financial conditions:**  \n  - The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago reported that **“financial conditions loosened slightly in late August and September”**. [BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago > Banking and Finance; Chicago > Summary of Economic Activity]\n  - This characterization covers the Chicago District over **late August and through September 2025**.\n\n- **Asset prices and market conditions:**  \n  - **Bond and equity values**: “**Bond and equity values rose a bit, while volatility remained unchanged.**” [BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago > Banking and Finance]\n    - This indicates **modest price increases** in both bond and equity markets during this period, contributing to an overall loosening in financial conditions.\n    - The report does **not** specify which bond types or equity indices, nor the size of the moves.\n\n- **Business lending conditions:**  \n  - **Business loan demand**: “**Business loan demand decreased slightly on net, with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity.**” [BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago > Banking and Finance]\n    - Over late August–September 2025, firms sought **slightly fewer loans overall**, partly because there was less borrowing related to acquisitions.\n  - **Borrowing costs (rates)**: “**Business loan rates moved down, but terms tightened.**” [BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago > Banking and Finance]\n    - **Interest rates on business loans fell** during this period, a price-based easing.\n  - **Nonprice terms / credit availability**:  \n    - At the same time, **loan terms tightened**, meaning lenders applied more stringent conditions (though the Beige Book does **not** detail which specific terms—e.g., collateral, covenants, or LTVs—changed).\n  - **Loan quality**: One summary of the period notes **loan quality declined modestly** on the business side, consistent with some weakening in business credit conditions, even as borrowing costs fell. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Consumer lending conditions:**  \n  - **Consumer loan demand**: “**In the consumer sector, loan demand increased slightly, with a few contacts noting a pickup in mortgage refinancing.**” [BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago > Banking and Finance]\n    - Through late August–September 2025, households’ **loan demand rose a bit**, supported in part by **more mortgage refinancing**.\n  - **Borrowing costs (rates)**: “**Loan quality remained flat and rates edged down, but terms tightened slightly.**” [BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago > Banking and Finance]\n    - **Consumer loan rates edged down**, another sign of price-based easing.\n  - **Nonprice terms / credit availability**:  \n    - **Terms tightened slightly** for consumer loans, indicating mildly stricter nonprice conditions even as rates fell.\n  - **Loan quality**: For consumer credit, **loan quality remained flat** over the period. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Net temporal pattern over the late‑August to September 2025 period**  \n- Over **late August and September 2025**, the Chicago District saw:\n  - **Slight loosening in overall financial conditions**, as reflected in:\n    - Modest **rises in bond and equity prices**.\n    - **Lower business and consumer loan rates**.\n  - **Simultaneous marginal tightening in credit terms**, as lenders:\n    - **Tightened terms for both business and consumer loans**, even while cutting rates.\n  - **Shifts in loan demand and quality**:\n    - **Business loan demand**: down slightly; **business loan quality**: modestly weaker.\n    - **Consumer loan demand**: up slightly (including more mortgage refinancing); **consumer loan quality**: flat.\n\nIn temporal terms, the Beige Book for **October 15, 2025** thus describes a **late‑August to September 2025** period in which financial conditions in the Chicago District **loosened slightly overall**, driven by higher asset prices and lower borrowing costs, while nonprice lending standards tightened somewhat and loan demand moved in opposite directions for businesses (down slightly) and consumers (up slightly).

The system adds extra details (loan rates, terms, consumer side, timing as 2025-10-15 Beige Book), but these do not conflict with the expected content.

In Chicago, crops were in good shape across most of the District, though soybean prices were lower due to absence of new-crop exports to China. In Atlanta, overall demand for agricultural products was healthy. Minneapolis agricultural contacts were concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases.",
      "system_answer": "Conditions in the agriculture sector were generally weak and had further deteriorated over the period covered.\n\n- Overall performance: Federal Reserve District reports described agricultural conditions as “weakened or strained,” with agriculture acting as a drag on many rural economies rather than a source of growth. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- Farm finances and risk of exit:\n  - Producers were under “severe financial stress” due to a combination of cost and price pressures.\n  - In the St. Louis District, contacts estimated that **up to one‑third of Arkansas farmers** could go bankrupt or leave farming without timely government support. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- Costs, prices, and margins:\n  - Farmers faced **high input costs** (e.g., fuel, fertilizer, chemicals) and **high financing costs** (more expensive credit), which squeezed profit margins.\n  - At the same time, **commodity prices were low**, worsening the margin squeeze and contributing to weakened farm incomes. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- Weather and production conditions:\n  - Several regions reported **adverse weather** that reduced crop quality.\n  - In **non‑irrigated fields**, overall conditions were poorer, with weather further undermining yields and quality. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- Labor availability:\n  - Many producers experienced **labor shortages**, which were linked in part to changes in immigration policy.\n  - These shortages **reduced harvests**, as some crops could not be fully or timely harvested. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- Demand conditions:\n  - While **demand for some protein products remained strong**, this did not offset broader weakness across crop sectors, so the overall agricultural sector remained under strain. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- Spillovers to rural economies:\n  - Weak agricultural conditions contributed to stress in **related rural sectors**, including **rural housing markets**, as farm income pressures fed through to broader local economic activity. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nIn sum, the agriculture sector was characterized by high costs, low prices, weather‑related production issues, labor shortages, and significant financial stress for farmers, with notable risk of widespread farm exits in some areas, particularly Arkansas.

It even references a specific estimate that one‑third of Arkansas farmers could go bankrupt. None of these details appear in the expected answer. It also misses all of the specific district distinctions and the key point that conditions were “mixed,” with Chicago and Atlanta having relatively positive aspects and Minneapolis’ China‑soybean concern. The system answer therefore contradicts the “mixed” characterization by portraying broad, generalized weakness and adds many unsupported, fabricated details.

      "expected_answer": "Agricultural contacts were concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases.",
      "system_answer": "Minneapolis District agricultural contacts were concerned that China had **stopped purchasing U.S. soybeans**, which had been an important export outlet for the District. They reported that **“agricultural conditions weakened”** in the Ninth District and specifically linked this weakening to **China’s elimination of soybean purchases**, i.e., a collapse in demand from a key foreign buyer for that particular crop. [BeigeBook_20251015, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis > Summary of Economic Activity; National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Minneapolis]\n\nHowever, in the available Beige Book excerpts:\n- Contacts **did not** explicitly attribute China’s halt in soybean buying to any specific **trade policies, tariffs, or negotiations**. The text only notes the outcome (China stopping soybean purchases), not the policy cause. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- The report notes that **agricultural conditions weakened**, but it **does not provide quantified financial details** such as explicit references to margins, bankruptcies, or loan delinquencies. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- There are **no direct statements** from Minneapolis District contacts about cutting or limiting **next-season investment** (e.g., equipment purchases or input use) due to China’s actions in the excerpts provided. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nAll other detailed China-related agricultural concerns in the same Beige Book—such as falling foreign demand “particularly from China” tied to trade policy adjustments and negotiations, and anticipated sales declines limiting next-season investment—come from the **San Francisco (Twelfth District)** section, not from Minneapolis. [BeigeBook_20251015, San Francisco, Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries]\n\nSo, based on the evidence provided, the specific, documented concern of **Minneapolis District agricultural contacts about China** was that **China’s elimination of soybean purchases weakened agricultural conditions in the District**, with no further details in the excerpts on the policy causes or on quantified financial impacts.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the expected answer: Minneapolis District agricultural contacts were concerned that China eliminated/stopped soybean purchases.\n\nSystem answer: States that contacts were concerned that China had “stopped purchasing U.S. soybeans,” explicitly describing it as “China’s elimination of soybean purchases” and linking this to weakened agricultural conditions. This directly matches and elaborates on the ground truth concern, without contradicting it. The additional clarifications (no explicit mention of causes like tariffs, no quantified financial details, distinction from San Francisco District content) are consistent and not incorrect. There are no factual errors relative to the expected answer, just more context and caveats.\n\nTherefore, all key facts from the expected answer are present and accurate, with no contradictions or hallucinated claims that conflict with the ground truth.",

[BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\nIn sum, the Beige Book reported that businesses generally anticipated **continued but modest economic growth**, with **pockets of near‑term improvement in demand** but **elevated uncertainty and policy‑related headwinds** leading many districts to describe their outlook as **neutral to cautiously optimistic, with notable downside risks.**",

This matches.\n2) It notes that some firms anticipated a mild pickup in demand and describes certain districts (e.g., Kansas City, New York, Cleveland) with improving or optimistic expectations. That is consistent with “sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts.”\n3) It explicitly mentions “over the next 6–12 months” and gives near‑term modest pickup examples. This matches.\n4) It repeatedly emphasizes elevated uncertainty, downside risks, and policy/tariff/inflation headwinds restraining activity, aligning with “elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity.”\n\nNo contradictions with the ground truth; the answer is more detailed but consistent and captures all key elements of the expected answer.\n\nVerdict: correct.",

      "system_answer": "In the Kansas City District, businesses expected 2026 to be stronger than 2025 along several dimensions:\n\n- **Overall outlook:** Contacts across most sectors reported a *broadly optimistic* outlook for 2026, even though recent economic activity had shown a slight decline and current conditions were mixed. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Sales expectations:** A **majority of firms** anticipated **higher sales by the end of 2026 compared with 2025**. This was true especially for **consumer‑facing sectors**, where most firms expected their 2026 sales to outperform 2025 despite current softness in demand. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Employment expectations:** Most business contacts also expected **higher employment levels in 2026 relative to 2025**, indicating plans for some degree of workforce expansion. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Price expectations:** Firms anticipated **raising selling prices in 2026 at a slightly faster pace than in 2025**, suggesting expectations of stronger demand and continued—though not sharply accelerating—price growth. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nOverall, the business expectations for 2026 in the Kansas City District were characterized by optimism for **stronger sales, more employment, and somewhat faster price increases** than in 2025, despite recent modest weakness in activity.

      "system_answer": "The Beige Book does not report any clear change in the *level* of nonprofit employment in the Cleveland District (it does not say whether nonprofit employment there rose, fell, or stayed the same), and it provides no numbers or job counts for that sector.\n\nHowever, it does describe employment conditions for Cleveland‑area nonprofits:\n- Many nonprofits in the Cleveland District are experiencing tighter finances, with decreased funding and in some cases drawing on reserve funds to cover operating expenses.\n- Because of uncertainty around federal grants, these nonprofits are **choosing not to fill open positions**, which is effectively restraining hiring in the sector.\n- In the broader local labor market, jobseekers served by nonprofits are more often receiving only part‑time offers with little or no benefits, and formerly incarcerated individuals are finding it harder to secure work. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland District]\n\nSo, based on the available evidence, what “happened” to nonprofit employment in the Cleveland District is best characterized as **constrained or restrained hiring due to funding uncertainty**, rather than documented increases or decreases in total employment levels. The Beige Book does not quantify the effect. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the expected answer: a respondent reported that the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants. \n\nIn the system answer:\n- It explicitly states: “Because of uncertainty around federal grants, these nonprofits are choosing not to fill open positions, which is effectively restraining hiring in the sector.” This matches the core ground‑truth fact.\n- The rest of the answer elaborates (tighter finances, reserve funds, broader labor‑market context, characterization as constrained hiring) but does not contradict the expected answer.\n- There are no factual errors relative to the expected answer, and the key point is clearly captured.\n\nTherefore, the answer includes all key information from the expected answer, with additional consistent context.",

      "question": "How did artificial intelligence affect employment decisions?",
      "expected_answer": "In some cases, employers cited increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies as a reason for lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition.",
      "system_answer": "Artificial intelligence affected employment decisions by changing both **how many people firms employed** and **what kinds of roles they hired for**, with clear cause‑and‑effect patterns in the Beige Book evidence.\n\n1. **AI investment → direct layoffs and lower headcount**  \n- Employers across **most Federal Reserve Districts** reported *lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition*.\n- This was caused by a mix of factors: **weaker demand, economic uncertainty, and—in some cases—increased investment in AI technologies** (National Summary, Labor Markets).\n- As a result, AI adoption became one explicit reason companies gave for reducing staff, not just an indirect or background factor.\n\n2. **Adoption of AI tools → automation of tasks → reduced labor needs**  \n- In the **Kansas City District**, “some professional service companies” said **larger recent layoffs were associated with the adoption and implementation of AI capabilities that reduced overall labor needs.**  \n  - This was caused by AI systems being able to perform work that previously required human employees.  \n  - As a result, these firms felt they could operate with fewer workers and explicitly tied that decision to AI.\n- In the **San Francisco District**, **employment reductions were coupled with investment in AI**, “particularly for positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees.”  \n  - This was caused by AI automating or speeding up junior‑level tasks.  \n  - As a result, companies cut staff in roles where AI could now do the work.\n\n3. **AI tools handling junior tasks → reduced demand for entry‑level and less-experienced workers**  \n- A **Minnesota advertising firm** reported there “will be a **smaller need for entry‑level folks** because AI tools **get this work done faster**” (Minneapolis, Labor Markets).  \n  - The reduced need was caused by AI’s ability to complete basic, routine tasks quickly.  \n  - As a result, the firm anticipated hiring fewer entry-level employees.\n- Similarly, in **San Francisco**, AI investments were tied to cuts in work “usually reserved for less experienced employees.”  \n  - This was caused by AI substituting for lower-skill, repetitive, or support work.  \n  - As a result, less-experienced positions were more likely to be reduced or not backfilled.\n\n4. **AI-enabled productivity gains + cost pressures → hiring chills and reliance on attrition**  \n- Nationally, more employers reported **lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition**, and some explicitly cited AI as part of why they could do so (National Summary, Labor Markets).  \n  - This was caused by AI increasing productivity, combined with **weaker demand** and **rising labor costs** (including “outsized increases” in health-insurance expenses).  \n  - As a result, firms could meet output targets with fewer people and chose to shrink headcount rather than grow it.\n- In the **Atlanta District**, firms described a **“hiring chill,” with welcomed attrition and fewer head count additions** even in growth areas.  \n  - This chill was caused partly by economic uncertainty and partly by improved efficiency (including early generative AI results) that reduced the perceived need to expand staff.  \n  - As a result, employers let natural turnover reduce staff levels instead of aggressively hiring.\n- In both **Minneapolis** and **San Francisco**, many contacts said **most hiring was to replace vacancies rather than support business expansion**, and employers were “holding head counts steady.”  \n  - This was caused by an environment where AI and other efficiency measures allowed firms to maintain output without expanding staff, alongside cautious demand expectations.  \n  - As a result, HR shifted to replacement-only hiring instead of adding net new positions.\n\n5. **Uncertainty + AI options → more temp and temp-to-hire instead of direct permanent hiring**  \n- A staffing contact in **Minneapolis** said that **uncertainty in the market has spurred more temp and temp-to-hire work rather than direct hiring.**  \n  - This was caused by employers wanting flexibility as they tested AI tools and reassessed long-term labor needs.  \n  - As a result, companies favored contingent labor arrangements over committing to permanent expansion of headcount.\n\n6. **Early generative AI results → expectations of further staff cuts**  \n- In **Atlanta**, “some firms expect further cuts based on early Generative AI implementation results, particularly if demand slows further.”  \n  - These expectations were caused by initial deployments of generative AI showing that the same volume of work could be done with fewer people.  \n  - As a result, managers are planning future reductions that will be triggered if business conditions weaken, using AI as a lever to shrink staff without sacrificing output.\n\n7. **Profitability and cost control goals → using AI to ‘right-size’ staffing**  \n- In **Kansas City**, contacts said impending layoffs were meant to **“right-size staffing levels with slightly softer demand conditions to maintain profitability.”**  \n  - This was caused by pressure to sustain margins in the face of softer demand and higher labor costs, while AI allowed more work per employee.  \n  - As a result, companies concluded they could cut staff without undermining performance, and they did so.\n\n8. **Crucial gap: No evidence on algorithmic hiring or bias from this source**  \n- The Beige Book passages **do not discuss** AI tools used directly in hiring (e.g., resume screeners, automated interviews) or their effect on **bias, discrimination, or fairness** in employment decisions.  \n  - Because the source is silent on this, any claim that AI hiring algorithms increased or reduced bias would not be supported by this evidence.  \n  - As a result, from this specific dataset we can only say how AI affected quantities and types of employment, not how it affected fairness or discrimination in hiring.\n\nOverall cause–effect pattern:\n- **Investments in AI and generative AI tools** → automate and speed up tasks, especially routine and junior-level work.  \n- **Automation and higher productivity** → firms need fewer workers to produce the same output.  \n- **Combined with weak or uncertain demand and rising labor costs** → employers choose layoffs, hiring freezes, welcomed attrition, replacement-only hiring, and more temporary work.  \n- **As a result**, AI is exerting a **dampening effect on labor demand**, particularly for entry-level and less-experienced roles, and is a specific, cited cause of some recent and planned headcount reductions. The available evidence does not show how AI affected hiring bias or fairness.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth is very short: AI affected employment decisions because in some cases employers cited increased investment in AI as a reason for lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. \n\nThe system answer contains that core point clearly and repeatedly:\n- It explicitly says \"AI investment → direct layoffs and lower headcount\" and that employers reported \"lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition\".\n- It attributes this \"in some cases\" to increased investment in AI technologies, matching the ground truth causality.\n\nThe rest of the answer elaborates with additional district-level examples and mechanisms. These are consistent with, and expansions on, the core idea rather than contradictions. There are no factual statements that conflict with the expected answer, and the key relationship (AI investment/implementation being cited as a reason for layoffs and lower headcount) is preserved.\n\nTherefore, the answer is correct and more detailed than required, not partially correct or incorrect, and it is not an abstention.",

This matches the ground truth.\n- The system correctly describes Minneapolis: economic activity contracted slightly while manufacturing was “flat.” This matches the ground truth.\n- The system correctly describes San Francisco: economic activity edged down slightly while manufacturing “remained stable / largely stable.” This matches the ground truth.\n- The system omits Kansas City entirely; there is no mention of the district or its manufacturing output growth moderating.\n- The system’s overall summary – that in districts where economic activity declined, manufacturing did not show a corresponding decline but was little changed, flat, or stable – is directionally consistent with “flat to slightly moderating,” but it misses the specific nuance about Kansas City’s moderating growth and the fact that Kansas City is part of the set of declining districts.\n\nThere are no clear factual errors in the districts it does mention, but the answer is incomplete because one of the four key districts (Kansas City) and its described behavior are missing.

      "expected_answer": "Six districts mentioned both tariff impacts on manufacturing AND labor shortages from immigration policies: (1) New York - tariff uncertainty weighed on manufacturers with one temporarily ceasing production due to high steel prices, while businesses in construction and hospitality reported difficulty finding workers due to immigration policy shifts. (2) Philadelphia - manufacturers reported increased cost pressures from tariffs and some tariff-related onshoring, while contacts noted disruptions from immigration policies including vacated positions due to visa status changes and decline in foreign-born workers in construction. (3) Atlanta - concerns over tariffs remained prevalent among manufacturers, while immigration policy impacts were more material than previously reported in agriculture and hospitality sectors. (4) Chicago - manufacturing contacts attributed metals price increases to tariffs, while contacts noted fear of immigration enforcement was reducing labor availability and revoked visas created rehiring needs. (5) St. Louis - contacts reported managing tariffs as a cost factor, while immigration policies resulted in labor shortages with workers in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture not reporting to work due to fears of deportation. (6) San Francisco - higher import duties led to cost increases for raw materials and electronic components used in manufacturing, while contacts in construction and manufacturing noted difficulty finding entry-level workers attributed to reduced immigration.",

      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth clearly states that six districts (New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, San Francisco) mentioned both tariff impacts on manufacturing and labor shortages from immigration policies, and describes those combined effects for each. The system answer instead asserts the opposite: that no Federal Reserve District is documented as mentioning both together, and concludes that none are identified. It only lists Richmond and Dallas for tariffs and St. Louis for immigration-related shortages, and explicitly denies that any single district has both. This directly contradicts the expected answer and misses all six required districts. The response is not an abstention; it gives a definitive but wrong claim. Thus it is factually incorrect relative to the ground truth.",

      "question": "What materials saw price decreases, and what caused those decreases in each district?",
      "expected_answer": "Steel prices decreased in the Atlanta (Sixth) District and lumber prices decreased in the San Francisco (Twelfth) District. In both cases, waning demand in those markets pushed prices down. This occurred even as overall prices rose during the reporting period.",
      "system_answer": "By district, the materials that saw price decreases and the causes can be summarized as follows, with explicit cause‑effect links:\n\n---\n### Seventh District (Chicago)\n**Materials with price decreases:**\n- Soybeans  \n- Corn  \n- Milk  \n- Eggs  \n\n**Cause–effect relationships:**\n- **Soybeans:**  \n  Soybean prices were lower. **This was caused by** the *absence of new‑crop exports to China*—a key export customer. As a result, demand from a major buyer fell, putting downward pressure on local soybean prices.\n\n- **Corn:**  \n  Corn prices were down **despite strong export volumes**. This was caused by other, unspecified market forces that outweighed the support from exports—most plausibly ample overall supply or broader market softness. As a result, producers faced lower corn prices even though they were selling strong volumes abroad.\n\n- **Milk and eggs:**  \n  Milk and egg prices declined. The Beige Book excerpt does not specify a direct cause. As a result, dairy and egg producers in the district were earning less per unit, but the exact drivers (e.g., oversupply, demand shifts, input‑cost dynamics) are not detailed in the provided text.\n\n---\n### Ninth District (Minneapolis)\n**Materials with price decreases (or low prices):**\n- Major crops, including corn and soybeans (described as having **low crop prices**)\n\n**Cause–effect relationships:**\n- **Row crops (including corn and soybeans):**  \n  Crop prices were low across the district. **This was caused by**:\n  - **Very strong production:** Corn production was expected to set new records, and soybean harvests were very strong.  \n  - **Elevated expenses:** Producers were also facing higher input costs.\n\n  As a result, abundant supply (record or near‑record harvests) combined with high costs pushed market prices down and **weighed on producer incomes**, even though volumes were high. The text does not list price declines for specific other commodities (such as wheat, hay, chickens, eggs, or milk), so those cannot be claimed here.\n\n*(Related energy note for context, not a price decline)*\n- In the same district, higher metals costs **raised** breakeven prices for crude oil; this is a cost increase, not a materials price decrease.\n\n---\n### Twelfth District (San Francisco)\n**Materials with price decreases:**\n- Lumber (domestic lumber used in construction)\n\n**Cause–effect relationships:**\n- **Lumber:**  \n  Lumber prices decreased. **This was caused by** *slowing construction activity*, which reduced builders’ urgency and increased their bargaining power. As a result, builders were able to **negotiate lower prices for domestic lumber**, putting downward pressure on lumber prices in the district.\n\n  The evidence supports slowing construction and stronger buyer negotiating leverage as the drivers; the text does not document “shorter contractor backlogs” as a cause.\n\n---\n### Sixth District (Atlanta)\n**Materials with price decreases / depressed prices:**\n- Soybeans  \n- Wheat  \n- Corn  \n\n(Described collectively as crops whose markets “remained depressed.”)\n\n**Cause–effect relationships:**\n- **Soybeans, wheat, and corn:**  \n  Prices and/or market conditions for these crops remained depressed. **This was caused by**:\n  - **Trade diversion to Brazil:** Chinese markets turned to Brazil for these commodities, reducing U.S. export demand from this key buyer.  \n  - **Trade‑policy volatility:** Ongoing uncertainty around trade policy weighed on export prospects more broadly.\n\n  As a result, weaker export demand—especially from China—left more supply in U.S. and regional markets and reduced pricing power for producers in the Sixth District, keeping soybean, wheat, and corn prices under pressure.\n\n  The supplied evidence here does not discuss specific material price moves for **steel** in this district, so no steel price decline can be reliably attributed or explained from this text set.\n\n---\n### First District (Boston)\n**Materials with price decreases:**\n- None explicitly identified in the provided text.\n\n**Cause–effect relationships:**\n- The Boston manufacturing excerpt mentions uncertainty about pricing and demand, but **does not report any specific material price decreases**. As a result, we cannot attribute any concrete price declines for particular materials in this district based on the evidence given.\n\n---\n### Districts and materials not confirmed in the provided evidence\n- Earlier references to **New York District** declines for milk, eggs, or soybeans, and to **retail fuel** price declines or **lower breakeven oil prices** in other districts, are **not supported by the supplied text excerpts**. As a result, they cannot be included as evidence‑backed price decreases or tied to specific causes here.\n\n---\n### Overall cause‑effect patterns across districts\nAcross the districts that did show material price decreases, the main causal mechanisms were:\n- **Weak export demand / trade shifts**  \n  - Seventh District soybeans: prices fell as **new‑crop exports to China were absent**.  \n  - Sixth District soybeans, wheat, and corn: markets remained depressed as **Chinese buyers turned to Brazil** and trade‑policy volatility weighed on exports.  \n  As a result, reduced foreign demand directly lowered prices or kept them depressed.\n\n- **High or record production with elevated costs**  \n  - Ninth District row crops (including corn and soybeans): **record or near‑record harvests** and **elevated expenses** produced **low crop prices** that squeezed producer incomes.  \n  As a result, abundant supply relative to demand pushed prices down, even while producers’ costs remained high.\n\n- **Sectoral demand slowdown**  \n  - Twelfth District lumber: **slowing construction activity** weakened demand and enhanced buyers’ negotiating leverage, causing lower lumber prices.  \n  As a result, construction‑related materials saw price declines tied to reduced building activity.\n\n- **Unspecified or not detailed causes**  \n  - Seventh District milk and eggs: prices declined, but the excerpt does not specify why, so the direct causal chain is not provided in the evidence.\n\nThese mechanisms together explain which materials saw price decreases in each district and how shifts in exports, production levels, construction activity, and cost conditions led to those outcomes.\n",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth is very specific: only two materials and districts matter—steel in the Atlanta (Sixth) District and lumber in the San Francisco (Twelfth) District—both falling due to waning demand, even as overall prices rose. \n\nThe system answer:\n- Correctly identifies lumber price decreases in the Twelfth District, with a demand‑side cause (slowing construction, weaker demand), which aligns with the ground truth in spirit for that part.\n- Explicitly denies that there is evidence for a steel price decline in the Sixth District: “The supplied evidence here does not discuss specific material price moves for steel in this district, so no steel price decline can be reliably attributed or explained from this text set.” This contradicts the expected answer, which clearly says steel prices decreased in the Atlanta District due to waning demand.\n- Introduces a large amount of additional material (soybeans, corn, milk, eggs, etc. in other districts) that is not part of the expected answer. Even if some of that might be plausible given other context, it diverges from what is asked and from the ground truth focus.\n\nKey facts check:\n- Steel in Atlanta: missing and explicitly rejected → contradiction with expected answer.\n- Lumber in San Francisco: partially aligned (price decrease with demand slowdown), but the answer does not mention that this occurred even as overall prices rose; however, that omission alone would just make it incomplete.\n- Common cause (waning demand in both cases, with the contrast to overall rising prices): only partially captured for lumber; entirely missing for steel.\n\nBecause an essential required fact (Atlanta steel prices declining due to waning demand) is denied, the answer is not just incomplete; it is factually at odds with the expected answer. That warrants an INCORRECT verdict rather than partially correct.\n",

Lower‑income households: acute financial strain → cutbacks and reliance on assistance\n\n• What they did:\n- Spent very cautiously and were **highly price sensitive**, often cutting back wherever possible.\n- Showed **rising use of food pantries** and other assistance to meet basic needs like food.\n- Had **difficulty paying rent, utilities, and other recurring bills**, and increasingly **drew down savings** just to cover basics. [Boston – Community Perspectives]\n- In the St. Louis District, low‑income households, along with some middle‑income households, increasingly used **“buy now, pay later” services** and had **elevated credit card delinquencies**, indicating stress even around routine consumption. [St. Louis – Consumer Spending]\n\n• What caused this behavior:\n- **Decreasing disposable income**: Kansas City contacts expected consumer lending portfolios to face challenges as **disposable income levels decrease**, especially for customers with **lower personal incomes**. This shrinking disposable income forced low‑income households to prioritize essentials and cut back on anything discretionary. [Kansas City – Community and Regional Banking]\n- **Rising cost and bill‑payment pressure**: Boston community contacts reported **increased difficulty paying rent, utilities, and other bills**, which directly crowded out nonessential spending. [Boston – Community Perspectives]\n- **Liquidity shortfalls**: Low‑ and moderate‑income consumers “increasingly used savings to cover basic needs,” signaling that regular income was no longer sufficient. As a result, they had to **slash discretionary outlays** and lean on food assistance to fill gaps. [Boston – Community Perspectives]\n- **Expected policy and price shocks**: Anticipated **cuts to SNAP and Medicaid** and **further price increases tied to tariffs** were cited as additional risks for low‑ and moderate‑income households. This looming loss of support and higher prices caused households to become even more defensive in their spending, reinforcing cutbacks and greater reliance on assistance. [Boston – Community Perspectives]\n\nAs a result of these combined pressures, lower‑income households concentrated spending on necessities, sharply reduced discretionary purchases, and increasingly depended on credit-like tools (BNPL) and food pantries to maintain even basic consumption.\n\n---\n\n2. Middle‑income (moderate‑income) households: rising stress → credit use and selective cutbacks\n\n• What they did:\n- Became **“increasingly cautious”** in their spending. [St. Louis – Consumer Spending]\n- **Used credit to maintain spending levels**, including heavier reliance on consumer credit broadly (e.g., credit cards, installment credit), and in St. Louis specifically, greater use of **BNPL** products. [St. Louis – Consumer Spending]\n- **Pulled back on discretionary categories**, especially **travel** and select‑service hotels; a St. Louis contact described conditions as a **“middle‑class recession.”** [St. Louis – Consumer Spending]\n- Like low‑income groups, many moderate‑income households showed **greater food pantry use** and difficulty paying bills, implying they were starting to experience similar precarity. [Boston – Community Perspectives]\n\n• What caused this behavior:\n- **Squeezed but not destitute budgets**: Middle‑income consumers had more income than low‑income households, but they were still hit by **decreasing disposable income** and **modest wage growth**, which left less room for nonessentials. This pushed them to **preserve their lifestyles by borrowing** rather than immediately slashing all discretionary spending. [Kansas City – Community and Regional Banking; Boston – Summary of Economic Activity]\n- **Emerging credit stress**: Kansas City banking contacts reported **moderate deterioration in consumer lending portfolios** and expected more challenges as disposable income falls, especially among customers with **lower personal incomes or employed in discretionary‑spending‑driven industries**. Many middle‑income workers fall into these categories. This deterioration reflects that middle‑income households were stretching with credit and beginning to struggle to service it. [Kansas City – Community and Regional Banking]\n- **Higher prices and tariff‑linked cost pressures**: With **prices rising at a moderate pace** due to tariffs and other costs, middle‑income households felt more pressure on day‑to‑day budgets than upper‑income households. As a result, they trimmed **nonessential travel and services** while trying to keep core consumption stable by borrowing. [Boston – Summary of Economic Activity]\n\nAs a result, middle‑income households occupied a “squeezed middle” position: they had too little slack to absorb higher costs comfortably, but enough access to credit to **delay deeper lifestyle cuts**, leading to higher credit use, early signs of financial stress, and specific cutbacks in discretionary categories like travel.\n\n---\n\n3. Upper‑income households: financial cushion → sustained discretionary and luxury spending\n\n• What they did:\n- **Maintained or increased spending** on **travel, events, and luxury services**, even while overall consumer spending was reported as slightly declining in some regions. In the St. Louis District, upper‑income households and corporate clients continued to support these categories. [St. Louis – Consumer Spending]\n- Continued to patronize **mid‑ to high‑end markets**, including higher‑end retail (e.g., apparel, cosmetics, fragrances) in the broader Beige Book synthesis, helping sustain overall demand in those segments.\n\n• What caused this behavior:\n- **Greater ability to absorb higher prices**: Upper‑income households had more robust incomes, higher savings, and more financial buffers. As **tariff‑related and other cost pressures** pushed prices up modestly, these households could accept those increases without major changes in behavior. This allowed firms serving higher‑end segments to pass through price increases with relatively limited demand loss. [Boston – Summary of Economic Activity]\n- **Lower exposure to immediate income shocks**: The evidence emphasizes falling disposable income and benefit cuts for low‑ and moderate‑income households; it does not cite equivalent acute pressures for upper‑income groups. With fewer constraints from rent, utilities, and essential bills relative to income, upper‑income households did not need to cut back on discretionary items.\n- **Concentration of demand in service and travel sectors**: Contacts in places like St. Louis reported that **travel, events, and luxury services** remained supported by upper‑income customers. Because these consumers kept spending, sectors catering to them experienced less of the pullback that affected more budget‑oriented travel and select‑service hotels serving the middle class. [St. Louis – Consumer Spending]\n\nAs a result, upper‑income households provided a stabilizing force for overall consumer spending, particularly in travel, luxury services, and high‑end retail, even as lower‑ and middle‑income households retrenched.\n\n---\n\n4. How the drivers map into different outcomes, side by side\n\n- **Income and benefit shocks**\n  - Lower‑income: Most exposed to **falling disposable income**, benefit cuts (SNAP, Medicaid), and difficulty paying essentials → **forced to cut discretionary spending sharply**, use savings, and rely on food pantries and alternative finance. [Boston – Community Perspectives; Kansas City – Community and Regional Banking]\n  - Middle‑income: Experiencing **squeezed disposable income** and modest wage growth but with more credit access → **maintain spending via borrowing**, then selectively cut higher‑ticket discretionary items (travel, hotels) as stress mounts. [St. Louis – Consumer Spending; Kansas City – Community and Regional Banking]\n  - Upper‑income: Least affected by these shocks → **little need to cut back**, so discretionary and luxury spending continues.\n\n- **Price and tariff pressures**\n  - Lower‑income: Higher prices on essentials consume a large share of income → **heightened price sensitivity**, purchase timing around deals, and substitution toward assistance and lower‑cost options.\n  - Middle‑income: Can absorb some increases but not all → **use credit to smooth consumption**, then trim more discretionary categories as sustained price increases erode budgets.\n  - Upper‑income: Can largely absorb moderate price increases → **keep buying higher‑end goods and services**, supporting sectors with more pricing power. [Boston – Summary of Economic Activity]\n\n- **Access to and condition of credit**\n  - Lower‑income: Limited and often high‑cost credit; in St. Louis, growing use of **BNPL** and elevated card delinquencies → **financial fragility**, with borrowing often tied to essentials rather than discretionary upgrades. [St. Louis – Consumer Spending]\n  - Middle‑income: Wider credit access → **increasing reliance on consumer credit** to maintain lifestyle, contributing to **moderate deterioration in lending portfolios** as stresses accumulate. [Kansas City – Community and Regional Banking]\n  - Upper‑income: Less need to rely on credit to meet routine expenses → **credit stress is less central** to their spending decisions.\n\n- **Resulting spending patterns**\n  - Lower‑income: Necessity‑driven, assistance‑supported, volatile in the sense of sudden cutbacks and shifts as income or benefits change. Food assistance and payment delays become part of the consumption strategy.\n  - Middle‑income: Cautious, credit‑supported, with **disproportionate pullbacks in mid‑price discretionary categories**, such as select‑service travel and some retail segments that target the middle class.\n  - Upper‑income: Relatively stable or robust spending, especially in **travel, events, luxury services, and high‑end retail**, helping sustain aggregate consumer spending despite weakness lower down the income distribution. [St. Louis – Consumer Spending]\n\n---\n\n5. Scope and limitations\n\n- Many of the clearest income‑specific behaviors (upper‑ vs middle‑ vs lower‑income) are documented in the **St. Louis District** and, for low‑/moderate‑income stress, in **Boston and Kansas City**. Not all 12 Federal Reserve Districts provide identical detail by income group in the excerpts available.\n- The Beige Book evidence is **qualitative**; it does not quantify changes in spending, volatility, or delinquency by income bracket.\n- Specific product types like “buy now, pay later” are explicitly cited in St. Louis; in other districts, increased credit use is described more generally without naming instruments.\n\nWithin those limits, the causal picture is clear: heavier exposure to falling disposable income, benefit cuts, and higher essential costs caused lower‑ and middle‑income households to cut back and rely more on assistance and credit, while upper‑income households’ stronger financial positions allowed them to continue spending on travel, luxury, and high‑end retail, creating distinct spending patterns across income groups.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements of the expected answer:\n1) Higher‑income individuals maintained strong spending on luxury travel and accommodation.\n2) Lower‑ and middle‑income households sought discounts and promotions / became more price sensitive due to rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty.\n3) The bifurcation was driven by rising prices eroding purchasing power for lower/middle‑income groups, while higher‑income groups remained relatively insulated.\n\nComparison:\n- The system clearly states that upper‑income households \"maintained or increased spending on travel, events, and luxury services\" and acted as a stabilizing force in travel and luxury services. This matches point (1) about strong spending on luxury travel and accommodation.\n- For lower‑ and middle‑income households, the system answer gives a very detailed description of acute financial strain, high price sensitivity, cautious spending, pullbacks on discretionary categories, and reliance on assistance and credit. This is consistent with the idea that they looked for ways to cope (which aligns conceptually with seeking discounts and promotions), though it does not explicitly mention “discounts and promotions.” Still, the described behavior—high price sensitivity, cutbacks, and substitution to cheaper options—captures the core of the ground truth.\n- As for drivers, the system answer repeatedly emphasizes decreasing disposable income, rising prices and cost pressures (including tariffs), difficulty paying bills, benefit cuts (SNAP, Medicaid), and the fact that upper‑income households had greater buffers and were less exposed to these shocks. This matches point (3): rising prices and income/benefit shocks eroding purchasing power for lower/middle groups, while higher‑income groups are more insulated.\n- There are no factual contradictions with the ground truth, and the system answer provides a more detailed, but consistent, causal explanation.\n\nAll key facts are present in substance: bifurcation by income, lower/middle groups constrained and defensive due to erosion of purchasing power and higher prices, higher‑income maintaining luxury/travel spending due to insulation. The extra detail is supportive, not contradictory.\n\nTherefore, the system answer is fully correct relative to the expected answer.",

      "question": "What is the relationship between AI investment and employment trends reported in the Beige Book?",
      "expected_answer": "Some employers cited increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies as one of the reasons for lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. This occurred alongside other factors like weaker demand and elevated economic uncertainty. Overall employment levels were largely stable, but demand for labor was generally muted, with more employers reporting layoffs and attrition.",
      "system_answer": "The Beige Book describes a clear cause‑and‑effect relationship in which increased AI investment is contributing to softer labor demand and targeted employment reductions, within a broader environment of a cooling but not collapsing labor market. The causal chain looks roughly like this:\n\n1. **Firms invest more in AI and automation technologies**  \n   - Many firms have recently increased investment in artificial intelligence and related technologies, including early implementation of generative AI tools and other automation capabilities. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. **AI adoption raises efficiency and reduces the need for certain labor**  \n   - This was caused by AI tools being able to perform tasks faster or with fewer people, particularly routine or entry‑level work:  \n     - Minneapolis contacts said AI is expected to have “a slight dampening effect on future labor demand,” with one firm noting there will be “a smaller need for entry-level folks” because AI completes that work more quickly. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n     - Kansas City reported that larger layoffs at some professional services firms were directly “associated with the adoption and implementation of AI capabilities that reduced overall labor needs.” [BeigeBook_20251015]\n     - San Francisco noted staff reductions via layoffs and attrition that were “coupled with investment in artificial intelligence,” especially for roles typically held by less-experienced workers. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - As a result, AI adoption allows firms to maintain or increase output with fewer workers in specific functions.\n\n3. **Direct employment effects: headcount reductions and dampened labor demand**  \n   - Nationally, some employers explicitly reported that **increased investment in AI technologies caused them to lower headcounts**. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - This was caused by AI-driven efficiency gains that made some positions redundant or reduced the number of people needed per unit of output.  \n   - As a result:\n     - Some districts (e.g., Kansas City, San Francisco, Atlanta) reported **layoffs or reductions in staff** tied to AI implementation. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n     - Minneapolis and other contacts expect AI to **slightly dampen future hiring needs**, especially at the entry level. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n     - Atlanta firms indicated that **if demand weakens**, early generative AI results give them scope to cut headcount further; AI thus amplifies the employment impact of any slowdown in demand. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n4. **Broader labor‑market trend: from very tight to cooler, more cautious**  \n   - At the same time, the Beige Book shows that overall employment is **mostly flat or slightly rising**, with more muted labor demand and low turnover. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - This was caused by a mix of factors, including weaker overall demand, uncertainty, and efficiency gains (of which AI is one driver).  \n   - As a result:\n     - Many firms are hiring **only for replacements or modest growth**, rather than aggressive expansion. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n     - There is a growing **“hiring chill”** and easier recruiting; in some areas labor supply now exceeds demand. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n     - Some sectors still add workers (e.g., parts of finance, insurance, IT), while others (manufacturing, parts of education and health care, and some firms in Atlanta and San Francisco) are **reducing headcounts via layoffs, attrition, and early retirements**. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n     - Major, broad-based layoffs are **not** yet evident, but **more firms report downsizing or planning cuts**, and AI-related efficiency gains are one of the reasons cited. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n5. **Sectoral and role-specific effects**  \n   - The Beige Book indicates that AI investment is **not** the main driver of employment trends in all sectors; instead, it **targets specific types of work**:  \n     - This was caused by AI being especially effective for routine, cognitive, or entry-level tasks, so:  \n       - **Professional services and some financial/IT roles** show layoffs directly tied to AI adoption. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n       - **Less-experienced/entry-level positions** are more exposed, as reported in San Francisco and Minneapolis. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n     - As a result, even while some occupations feel AI‑related pressure, the Beige Book still notes **ongoing shortages** in hospitality, agriculture, construction, and some manufacturing roles—areas where current AI tools are less substitutable for human labor and where immigration/policy factors play a larger role. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n6. **Combined effect: AI as a contributing, not sole, cause of cooling employment**  \n   - Overall, the relationship runs from **greater AI investment → higher efficiency and automation of specific tasks → reduced need for some workers → softer labor demand in affected occupations and sectors**.  \n   - This was caused by firms using AI to control costs and manage uncertainty rather than expand aggressively.  \n   - As a result, the Beige Book portrays AI as a **meaningful but mostly incremental** driver: it contributes to a broader pattern of cautious hiring and selective downsizing, rather than triggering a sharp, economy‑wide employment decline.\n\nIn summary, the Beige Book links AI investment causally to: (1) direct headcount reductions and layoffs in certain sectors and roles, especially entry-level and professional services; and (2) a slight dampening of future labor demand more generally. These AI-driven effects operate alongside weaker demand and broader uncertainty to produce the current pattern of flat-to-slightly-rising employment with cautious hiring and localized job cuts.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the expected answer:\n1) Some employers cited increased investment in AI as a reason for lowering head counts via layoffs and attrition.\n2) This occurred alongside other factors such as weaker demand and elevated uncertainty.\n3) Overall employment levels were largely stable/flat, but labor demand was muted.\n4) More employers reported layoffs and attrition, within a cooling but not collapsing labor market.\n\nThe system answer:\n- Clearly states that increased AI investment is contributing to softer labor demand and targeted employment reductions, including layoffs and headcount reductions. This matches point (1).\n- Explicitly notes that AI is one of several factors, alongside weaker demand and uncertainty, contributing to cautious hiring and downsizing, matching point (2).\n- Describes the broader environment as a cooling but not collapsing labor market, with overall employment mostly flat or slightly rising and muted labor demand; this aligns with points (3) and (4).\n- It adds more detail (district examples, sectoral nuances) but these are consistent elaborations, not contradictions.\n- There are no factual contradictions with the expected answer; all core relationships are captured: AI investment linked to layoffs/attrition and muted labor demand, in a generally stable but cooler labor market with more reports of downsizing.\n\nTherefore the answer is complete and accurate relative to the expected answer.",

Districts with decline (New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco) had varied outlooks: New York businesses did not expect activity to increase much; Kansas City was broadly optimistic for 2026 despite recent declines; Minneapolis saw contraction across most sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Below is a side‑by‑side comparison of the economic outlook in districts that saw growth versus those that saw decline, organized by key aspects.\n\n---\n### Overall Economic Activity\n- **Growth Districts**\n  - **Boston**: Economic activity “expanded slightly,” indicating a mild but positive trajectory. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Philadelphia (Third District)**: Activity “increased slightly,” with some sectors—like manufacturing—showing moderate gains. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Richmond (Fifth District)**: Economy “continued to grow modestly,” with overall conditions edging up rather than down. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Decline Districts**\n  - **New York (Second District)**: Economic activity “continued to decline slightly,” showing a persistent, if modest, downtrend. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Minneapolis (Ninth District)**: Activity was “slightly down,” pointing to broad, though not sharp, weakening. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Kansas City (Tenth District)**: Activity “fell slightly,” reflecting softening across several sectors. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **San Francisco (Twelfth District)**: Activity “edged down slightly,” signaling a gentle but clear decline. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Contrast**: Growth districts report slight-to-modest expansion; decline districts report slight contraction. The magnitudes are small on both sides, but the direction of change is consistently opposite.\n\n---\n### Consumer Spending and Demand\n- **Growth Districts**\n  - **Boston**: Modest growth in consumer spending supports the slight expansion. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Philadelphia**: Consumer demand is sufficient to sustain a “slight” increase in overall activity. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Richmond**: Modest gains in consumer spending are one of the main drivers of the district’s modest growth. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Decline Districts**\n  - **New York**: Overall activity is drifting down; firms do not expect much improvement in near‑term demand. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Minneapolis**: Declines in consumer spending and tourism are explicitly noted, reinforcing a softer demand environment. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Kansas City**: Several sectors report softer demand, contributing to the slight fall in activity. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **San Francisco**: Weakness in retail and small businesses points to softer consumer demand and constrained spending. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Contrast**: Growth districts emphasize modest but positive consumer spending trends; decline districts emphasize weakening or soft consumer demand, especially in retail and tourism.\n\n---\n### Sectoral Performance (Manufacturing, Trade, Real Estate, Agriculture)\n- **Growth Districts**\n  - **Philadelphia**: Manufacturing shows moderate gains and is a relative bright spot, contributing to the “slight” overall increase. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Richmond**: Slightly higher port volumes and modest consumer‑related sectors are positive; most other sectors are flat rather than contracting. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Boston**: No strong sectoral booms are highlighted, but there is broad, slight expansion rather than sectoral deterioration. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Decline Districts**\n  - **New York**: Activity is slipping broadly, though employment is steady; no major sector stands out as a driver of growth, and the tone is flat‑to‑weak. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Minneapolis**: Declines span consumer spending, tourism, construction, residential real estate, energy, and agriculture—indicating a wide, multi‑sector softening. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Kansas City**: Softness across several sectors (not just one) drives the slight overall decline; loan and farm conditions are under some pressure, and employment has edged lower. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **San Francisco**: Weakness is concentrated in retail, residential real estate, agriculture, and small businesses. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Contrast**: Growth districts either have specific bright spots (manufacturing in Philadelphia, ports in Richmond) or at least stability across sectors; decline districts report simultaneous weakness across multiple key sectors (retail, tourism, real estate, agriculture, small business).\n\n---\n### Employment Conditions\n- **Growth Districts**\n  - **Boston**: Employment conditions are sufficiently stable to support a cautiously optimistic tone; no broad layoffs are emphasized. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Philadelphia**: Firms anticipate modest increases in activity over six months, often associated with at least stable or gradually rising employment. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Richmond**: Ongoing modest growth suggests labor demand is generally holding up, consistent with a modestly expanding labor market. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Decline Districts**\n  - **New York**: Employment is “steady” despite the decline in activity; the labor market is not worsening yet but is not a source of momentum either. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Minneapolis**: Employment details are not emphasized, but broad sectoral declines suggest labor demand is under pressure in affected industries. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Kansas City**: Employment “fell slightly,” directly mirroring the slight fall in overall activity. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **San Francisco**: Weakness in small businesses and real estate typically implies softer hiring, and contacts’ outlook has weakened, indicating cautious labor demand. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Contrast**: Growth districts tend to report stable or modestly improving employment aligned with slight expansion; decline districts range from steady (New York) to slightly declining employment (Kansas City), with weaker hiring intentions implied in Minneapolis and San Francisco.\n\n---\n### Prices, Wages, and Inflation Pressures\n- **Growth Districts**\n  - **Boston**: Price and wage growth are present but described as contained enough to be consistent with a “neutral to cautiously optimistic” outlook rather than acute inflation stress. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Philadelphia & Richmond**: Moderate wage and price increases accompany modest growth, but they are not the central concern in their outlook narratives. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Decline Districts**\n  - **New York**: Price increases remain elevated even as activity declines, squeezing margins and household purchasing power. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco**: Contacts highlight eroding purchasing power from inflation and some deterioration in loan portfolios, indicating that inflation and financing conditions are heavier drags on activity. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Contrast**: In growth districts, inflation and wage growth are present but manageable alongside expansion; in decline districts, elevated prices and related financial stress are more clearly weighing on demand and contributing to a weaker outlook.\n\n---\n### Forward-Looking Outlook and Sentiment\n- **Growth Districts**\n  - **Boston**: Outlook is “neutral to cautiously optimistic,” but “mostly downside risks” are noted—growth is modest and fragile. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Philadelphia**: Firms expect a “modest increase” in activity over the next six months, though they flag risks such as a potential government shutdown. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Richmond**: Contacts expect “modest ongoing growth,” with no major acceleration but a continuation of current modest trends. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Decline Districts**\n  - **New York**: Businesses “do not expect much improvement” in coming months, signaling a weak and cautious near‑term outlook. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Minneapolis**: The breadth of declines (consumer, tourism, construction, agriculture) implies a cautious, softening outlook with limited near‑term upside. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Kansas City**: Near‑term outlook is weak, but “most contacts expect higher sales and employment by end‑2026,” indicating medium‑term optimism despite current softness. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **San Francisco**: Contacts’ economic outlook has “weakened somewhat” compared with the prior period, reflecting growing caution or mild pessimism. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Contrast**: Growth districts generally expect modest further gains but stress downside risks; decline districts expect continued weakness or only gradual, delayed improvement (Kansas City by end‑2026), with business sentiment weakened compared to earlier periods.\n\n---\n### Risk Profile and Uncertainty\n- **Growth Districts**\n  - **Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond**: Risks are acknowledged (e.g., potential government shutdown, general downside risks), but they are framed against a baseline of continued modest growth. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Decline Districts**\n  - **New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco**: Elevated uncertainty, weaker outlooks, deteriorating loan portfolios, and the drag from inflation are more central to their narratives, suggesting that risk is skewed toward prolonged softness or only limited improvement. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Contrast**: In growth districts, uncertainty is a caveat to modest expansion; in decline districts, uncertainty and risk are primary features shaping a more cautious or pessimistic outlook.\n\n---\n### Summary\n- **Growth districts (Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond)** present a picture of **slight to modest expansion**, supported by modest consumer spending, specific sectoral bright spots (manufacturing, ports), generally stable labor markets, and a **neutral-to-cautiously-optimistic** outlook with recognized downside risks. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Decline districts (New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco)** show **slight but broad‑based declines**, with weakness across multiple key sectors (retail, tourism, real estate, agriculture, small business), flat or slightly weakening employment, ongoing inflation pressures, and **weakened or only mildly hopeful outlooks**, often expecting at best limited near‑term improvement. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nThe core difference is directional: modest, fragile growth with cautious optimism in the growth districts versus modest contraction with heightened uncertainty and weaker sentiment in the decline districts.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The question focuses specifically on the *economic outlook* comparison. The ground truth key points:\n- Growth districts: Boston neutral to cautiously optimistic with mostly downside risks; Philadelphia modest growth but heightened uncertainty; Richmond also in growth group (outlook not elaborated in ground truth but implicitly modest growth).\n- Decline districts: New York businesses do not expect activity to increase much; Kansas City broadly optimistic for 2026 despite recent declines; Minneapolis saw contraction across most sectors (implying a weak outlook).\n\nThe system answer:\n- Clearly identifies growth vs decline districts correctly.\n- For growth districts, explicitly states: Boston “neutral to cautiously optimistic” with downside risks; Philadelphia expects a “modest increase” in activity but flags risks; Richmond expects “modest ongoing growth.” This matches and slightly elaborates the ground truth, without contradiction.\n- For decline districts, it states: New York businesses “do not expect much improvement”; Kansas City near‑term weak but “most contacts expect higher sales and employment by end‑2026” (broad medium‑term optimism); Minneapolis has broad sectoral declines implying a cautious/soft outlook; San Francisco outlook has weakened. This aligns with and extends the ground truth (which only singled out New York, Kansas City, and Minneapolis) and is consistent with it.\n- The answer adds more dimensions (consumer spending, sectors, employment, prices, risk), but these are used to support and sharpen the outlook contrast. Nothing contradicts the expected answer; all required outlook elements are present and accurate, and the contrast between cautious/modest optimism in growth districts vs weak/uncertain outlooks in decline districts is made very clear.\n\nBecause all key outlook facts from the expected answer are included, correctly stated, and expanded without error, the answer is fully correct rather than only partially correct.",

      "expected_answer": "In the Minneapolis District, agricultural contacts were specifically concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases, representing a direct trade policy impact. In the St. Louis District, agriculture conditions were strained and further deteriorated, with the overall pessimistic outlook. Across reporting districts, activity in agriculture was generally down, with trade uncertainty adding to sector challenges.",
      "system_answer": "Trade-related concerns affected agriculture mainly by disrupting export markets and raising uncertainty and costs. This set off a chain of cause‑and‑effect responses that varied across districts.\n\n1. Higher tariffs and weaker external demand → Broad pressure on agriculture\n- Across many Districts, firms reported **“challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand”** and **“tariff‑induced input cost increases”**.\n- This was caused by the imposition of higher tariffs and trade tensions, which raised costs for imported inputs (e.g., fuel, equipment, materials) and weakened foreign demand.\n- As a result, **agricultural activity was “generally down among reporting Districts”**, and overall farm conditions **weakened** in places like the **Minneapolis (Ninth)** and **San Francisco (Twelfth)** Districts, even when production itself was not necessarily poor.\n\n2. China’s reduced purchases and trade policy volatility → Lower crop prices and income (Chicago, Atlanta, Minneapolis)\n\na. Chicago (Seventh District)\n- **Cause:** The Beige Book notes that **“soybean prices were lower, in part due to the absence of new‑crop exports to China,”** and that **“corn prices were down despite strong export volumes.”**\n- This was caused by disrupted or missing Chinese demand for new‑crop soybeans and broader trade uncertainty.\n- As a result:\n  - **Soybean revenues fell** because prices dropped when a key export buyer (China) pulled back.\n  - **Corn producers also faced lower prices** even though export volumes were strong, adding to uncertainty about future returns.\n  - The report adds that **“lack of clarity on the economic outlook was putting a damper on capital investment, such as equipment purchases and repairs.”** Thus, weaker and more volatile prices plus export uncertainty **led farmers to delay or scale back equipment and repair spending**.\n\nb. Atlanta (Sixth District)\n- **Cause:** The Atlanta agriculture section states that **“trade policy volatility weighed on agricultural exports.”** It specifies that:\n  - **“Overseas sales of domestic rice declined as buyers sourced from other countries at lower prices.”**\n  - **“Crops such as soybean, wheat, and corn remained depressed while Chinese markets turned to Brazil for these commodities.”**\n- This was caused by volatile trade policy and a shift of major foreign buyers—especially China—to lower‑priced suppliers such as Brazil.\n- As a result:\n  - **Export‑oriented crops (rice, soybeans, wheat, corn) suffered depressed prices and weaker overseas sales**, directly squeezing incomes for growers of those crops in the Atlanta District.\n  - At the same time, **domestically oriented products performed better**: the report notes that **domestic demand for beef, poultry, peanuts, and tobacco was strong.** Strong internal demand insulated these producers from some of the trade shock.\n  - For **dairy**, farmers reported **flat year‑over‑year sales**, but noted that **demand from food‑service providers (cruise lines, resorts, restaurants) was “on fire,”** with retail dairy sales stable. As a result, dairy was **held steady by robust food‑service demand**, even though it did not see outright volume gains.\n\nc. Minneapolis (Ninth District)\n- **Cause:** In the Minneapolis District, **corn production was expected to set new records and soybean harvests were very strong**, but contacts were **“extremely concerned about the impacts of China’s decision not to order soybeans from U.S. producers.”** The national summary similarly notes that **agricultural contacts were concerned about China’s elimination of soybean purchases.**\n- This was caused by strong output colliding with trade actions by China that sharply curtailed U.S. soybean purchases, amid elevated input costs.\n- As a result:\n  - **Crop prices remained low and expenses were elevated**, which **weighed down producer incomes** despite very strong yields.\n  - Agricultural conditions in the District **weakened**, driven not by poor harvests but by **weak prices and trade‑driven demand loss**.\n\n3. Trade pressures + weak crop profits → Deteriorating finances and sentiment (Kansas City and others)\n- In the **Kansas City (Tenth District)**, reports note that **profit opportunities for crop producers remained weak**, while livestock—especially cattle—was considerably stronger.\n- This weakness in crop profits was caused in part by the same broader environment of tariffs, higher costs, and soft global demand described at the national level, though the text does not tie it to a specific tariff or country.\n- As a result:\n  - **Agricultural credit conditions deteriorated**; over **80 percent of lenders in crop‑heavy areas reported declines in farm income and working capital**, and many said this was **having a modest negative effect on local economic conditions**.\n  - **Farmer sentiment weakened**, as producers faced shrinking margins and rising financial stress, which likely limited their capacity and willingness to invest, even though explicit investment cutbacks are not directly reported.\n\n4. Tariffs raising input costs → Higher cost structure for farm‑related sectors (multiple Districts)\n- The national report states that **“tariff‑induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts,”** and the Richmond District notes that **price growth picked up somewhat in manufacturing, with firms citing tariffs.**\n- This was caused by tariffs on imported materials, equipment, or intermediate goods, which raised costs for sectors that supply agriculture (machinery, transportation, infrastructure) and for some on‑farm inputs.\n- As a result:\n  - **Farmers and agribusinesses faced higher costs for equipment, steel‑intensive structures, and other inputs**, eroding margins on top of already‑weak crop prices.\n  - In combination with uncertain demand, these higher costs **reinforced hesitation around capital spending** in districts like Chicago, where contacts explicitly said uncertainty was **“putting a damper on capital investment.”**\n\n5. Cross‑district variation in impacts\n- **Common mechanism across Districts:**\n  - Higher tariffs and trade tensions → weaker export demand and/or buyers switching to cheaper foreign suppliers → lower prices and revenues for export‑reliant crops → weaker farm incomes and deteriorating credit conditions → reduced willingness or ability to invest.\n- **Differences by District and product mix:**\n  - **Atlanta (Sixth District):** Most explicit link between trade policy volatility and agriculture. Export‑reliant crops (rice, soybeans, wheat, corn) were hurt as buyers—especially China—shifted to Brazil and other cheaper sources, while domestically focused products (beef, poultry, peanuts, tobacco, food‑service‑oriented dairy) held up better because they relied on strong U.S. demand.\n  - **Chicago (Seventh District):** The main effects were **weaker soybean prices due to missing Chinese exports** and **lower corn prices despite strong export volumes**, which **caused uncertainty and directly damped farm capital investment** in equipment and repairs.\n  - **Minneapolis (Ninth District):** Agriculture suffered from **low prices and high costs despite record or near‑record harvests**, with producers **extremely concerned about China’s cessation of soybean orders**; here, trade concerns mainly translated into **income pressure and heightened anxiety**, not poor yields.\n  - **Kansas City (Tenth District):** Crops faced **weak profit opportunities and deteriorating credit conditions**, while livestock fared better; trade tensions are part of the broader headwinds, though not singled out to specific commodities.\n  - **Other Districts (e.g., San Francisco, some national references):** Report **“weakened” agricultural conditions** and sectoral slowdowns, consistent with the nationwide pattern of tariffs and soft demand weighing on the farm economy, but without commodity‑level detail.\n\nIn sum, trade‑related concerns—especially tariffs, trade policy volatility, and China’s reduced purchases of U.S. crops—**caused lower prices and weaker export demand for key crops, raised uncertainty, and increased input costs.** As a result, many districts reported **weaker agricultural conditions, strained farm finances, deteriorating credit metrics, and, where explicitly noted (such as in Chicago), a dampening of capital investment**, with the severity and exact channels differing by district and by the mix of export‑ versus domestically oriented farm products.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) In the Minneapolis District, agricultural contacts were specifically concerned about China’s elimination of soybean purchases, as a direct trade policy impact.\n2) In the St. Louis District, agricultural conditions were strained and further deteriorated with a pessimistic outlook.\n3) Across reporting districts, agricultural activity was generally down, with trade uncertainty adding to challenges.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer clearly includes point (1): it explicitly states for Minneapolis that contacts were “extremely concerned about the impacts of China’s decision not to order soybeans from U.S. producers” and notes that the national summary mentions concern about China’s elimination of soybean purchases. This matches the expected detail for the Minneapolis District.\n- The system answer also captures point (3): it says agricultural activity was “generally down among reporting Districts,” attributes this to higher tariffs, trade tensions, and uncertainty, and describes broadly weaker agricultural conditions across multiple districts.\n- The missing/incorrect piece is (2): St. Louis District is not mentioned at all. Instead, the answer talks in detail about Chicago, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and others, but never addresses that in St. Louis agriculture conditions were strained and further deteriorated with a pessimistic outlook. That is a key part of the ground truth.\n- There are no direct factual contradictions with the expected answer; the system answer is longer and adds other districts and mechanisms, but nothing contradicts the ground truth content that is present.\n\nGiven that a key requested element (St. Louis specifics) is omitted, while the other key elements are correctly described and nothing is wrong, the answer is incomplete but not incorrect or misleading regarding what it does cover.\n\nVerdict: partially correct.",

      "question": "How did federal policy changes affect nonprofits across multiple districts?",
      "expected_answer": "In the New York District, nonprofits faced challenges due to unpredictable funding and reduction in federal benefit programs, with a community health-care center reporting financial distress among Medicaid patients. In the Cleveland District, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to uncertainty around federal grants. In the Boston District, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health-care sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Federal policy changes affected nonprofits through several distinct cause‑and‑effect channels, which played out somewhat differently across districts. The Beige Book evidence is qualitative, but it clearly traces how changes in federal benefits, grants, and other policies translated into nonprofit funding stress, hiring decisions, and rising service demand.\n\n1. Federal benefit cuts → Household hardship → Higher demand and more strain on nonprofits\n\n- **Cause: Reductions or planned cuts in federal benefit programs (SNAP, Medicaid, other federal benefits).**  \n  - In the **New York District**, contacts explicitly cited “a reduction in federal benefit programs” as a key problem for nonprofits. Many nonprofits faced challenges because funding was “unpredictable” and federal benefits had been reduced. This was caused by federal policy decisions that scaled back or destabilized benefit flows. [New York – Community Perspectives]\n  - In the **Boston District**, community contacts pointed to “planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid,” along with tariff‑linked price increases, as looming risks for low‑ and moderate‑income households. [Boston – Community Perspectives]\n\n- **Intermediate effect: Greater financial distress for low‑income households.**  \n  - Boston contacts reported **greater food pantry use and increased difficulty paying rent, utilities, and other bills**, and noted that households were increasingly drawing down savings to cover basic needs. This was caused by tighter household budgets as benefits stagnated or fell and prices rose. [Boston – Community Perspectives]\n  - In New York, a community health‑care center saw **rising financial distress among Medicaid patients**, which limited their access to care. This was caused by cuts or constraints in Medicaid and related benefit programs, leaving patients unable to pay or meet cost‑sharing. [New York – Community Perspectives]\n\n- **Resulting impact on nonprofits:**  \n  - In **New York**, the increased financial distress of Medicaid patients **strained the finances of the community health‑care provider**: patients’ inability to pay led directly to lost revenue and higher uncompensated‑care burdens. This was caused by the same federal benefit reductions that made Medicaid coverage and other supports less adequate. [New York – Community Perspectives]\n  - In **Boston**, higher demand for food pantries and trouble paying basic bills implied that local charities and social‑service nonprofits had to serve more people and cover more basic needs. This was caused by cuts and planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid and by higher prices linked to tariffs. [Boston – Community Perspectives]\n\nAcross districts, the pattern is: **federal benefit cuts and policy risks → more household hardship → increased use of nonprofits and greater financial strain on service providers.**\n\n2. Federal grant uncertainty and cuts → Funding instability → Hiring freezes and use of reserves\n\n- **Cause: Uncertainty and reductions in federal grants to nonprofits.**  \n  - In the **Cleveland District**, a semiannual survey of nonprofits found that a growing share reported **decreased funding over the past six months**, and respondents specifically highlighted **uncertainty around federal grants** as a key concern. This uncertainty was caused by changing or unpredictable federal grant policies and appropriations. [Cleveland – Community Conditions]\n  - In **New York**, nonprofits more generally faced “unpredictable funding,” which included uncertainty related to federal support. [New York – Community Perspectives]\n\n- **Intermediate effect: Instability in organizational finances.**  \n  - In Cleveland, one nonprofit “had to dip into its reserve fund to cover operating expenses for the first time in more than ten years.” This was caused by declining and uncertain funding streams, including federal grants, that no longer covered ongoing operating costs. [Cleveland – Community Conditions]\n\n- **Resulting impact on staffing and operations:**  \n  - Cleveland respondents reported that **“the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants.”** Hiring decisions were directly constrained by fear that promised or expected federal funds might not materialize. This was caused by the perceived risk that new hires would be unsustainable if grants were cut or delayed. [Cleveland – Community Conditions]\n  - The combination of reserve use and hiring restraint meant nonprofits were trying to **maintain services with fewer staff and thinner financial cushions**, increasing operational strain.\n\nThus, across affected districts (especially Cleveland and New York): **federal grant uncertainty and funding reductions → nonprofits’ operating shortfalls → drawing on reserves and holding positions vacant → constrained capacity even as community needs rise.**\n\n3. Federal policy–driven cost pressures (including tariffs) → Higher operating costs → Additional financial stress on nonprofits\n\n- **Cause: Federal policies raising costs (e.g., tariffs, insurance and regulatory costs).**  \n  - In **Boston**, community contacts warned that “further increases in consumer prices linked to tariffs” posed additional risks to low‑ and moderate‑income households. These price increases were caused by federal tariff policy. [Boston – Community Perspectives]\n  - In **New York**, “rising business costs, including insurance,” added to “financial pressures for community service providers.” These higher costs are partly shaped by federal regulatory and insurance environments. [New York – Community Perspectives]\n\n- **Effect on nonprofits and communities:**  \n  - Tariff‑driven price increases in Boston made essentials more expensive, **worsening the gap between household resources and basic needs**. This was caused by higher import costs being passed on to consumers, which, in turn, pushed more people toward food pantries and assistance programs. [Boston – Community Perspectives]\n  - In New York, rising operating costs **intensified the financial squeeze** on nonprofits already coping with unpredictable funding and benefit reductions. This was caused by the need to absorb higher insurance and other overhead costs without commensurate revenue increases. [New York – Community Perspectives]\n\nSo another chain is: **tariffs and other federal cost‑raising policies → higher prices and operating costs → more household hardship and higher nonprofit overhead → additional financial strain on nonprofits.**\n\n4. Immigration policy changes → Labor shortages and slower local activity → Indirect pressure on nonprofits\n\n- **Cause: Shifts in immigration policy tightening labor supply.**  \n  - The **National Summary** and several districts (Philadelphia, San Francisco, New York, St. Louis) reported that “labor supply in the hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing sectors was strained…due to recent changes to immigration policies.” [National Summary – Labor Markets]  \n  - The **Philadelphia District** cited “potential disruptions in the labor market from immigration policies,” including firms needing to replace workers who lost visa status and construction contacts seeing a decline in foreign‑born workers that caused delays. [Philadelphia – Labor Markets]  \n  - The **San Francisco District** noted that agricultural contacts “reported difficulties finding enough labor due to changes in immigration policy,” with labor shortfalls reducing harvests and limiting future investment. [San Francisco – Agriculture and Resource‑Related Industries]  \n  - The **New York District** reported that some construction and hospitality businesses had trouble finding workers “due to shifts in immigration policy.” [New York – Labor Markets]  \n  - The **St. Louis District** described ongoing labor shortages attributed to immigration policies. [St. Louis – Summary of Economic Activity]\n\n- **Intermediate effect: Labor shortages, project delays, and reduced output.**  \n  - Across these districts, immigration‑policy changes **reduced the availability of foreign‑born workers**, which caused delays in construction projects, constrained agricultural harvests, and generally tightened labor markets in lower‑wage sectors.\n\n- **Indirect impact on nonprofits:**  \n  - While the excerpts do **not** directly say that immigration policy changes reduced nonprofit funding or increased nonprofit demand, the plausible chain is: tighter labor markets and project delays can **slow local economic growth and exacerbate instability for low‑wage workers**, which in turn can increase reliance on community services.  \n  - However, any claim that “immigration‑policy changes weakened demand for small businesses and community organizations” or directly cut nonprofit revenues **is not documented** in the cited passages and should be treated as an inference rather than a stated finding.\n\nThus, the documented causal link is: **immigration policy changes → labor shortages and output constraints in key sectors.** Any further step to nonprofit impacts remains indirect in this evidence.\n\n5. Rising community need + funding stress → Elevated nonprofit demand and adaptation (varies by district)\n\nAcross districts, the combined effect of federal benefit cuts, grant uncertainty, cost pressures, and broader economic conditions produced **rising demand for services at the same time that nonprofit resources were tightening**, but with some regional variation.\n\n- **Dallas District:**  \n  - Contacts reported that “Nonprofits continue to see **elevated demand for a broad range of social services**.” Food and utility assistance remained core needs, and **demand for rental and housing assistance increased**, with one contact noting that evictions were on the rise. This surge in need was caused by household financial stress and housing instability in the region. [Dallas – Community Perspectives]  \n  - “Funding remains a concern for nonprofits,” prompting some to **explore alternative revenue streams**. While the excerpts do not detail specific models (e.g., e‑learning, e‑commerce) for Dallas in this dataset, they do show that nonprofits were pushed to adjust business models because traditional funding was not keeping pace with need. [Dallas – Community Perspectives]\n\n- **St. Louis District:**  \n  - “Nonprofit organizations reported a **growing demand for their services**.” This was caused by worsening community needs (e.g., economic stress, housing, food insecurity), though the excerpt does not attribute it to a specific federal policy. [St. Louis – Nonfinancial Services]\n\n- **New York District:**  \n  - Rather than emphasizing rising demand, the New York narrative focuses on **financial strain** from “unpredictable funding and a reduction in federal benefit programs” and “rising business costs,” which together **tighten the operating environment** for nonprofits. This was caused by both federal policy changes (benefits, possibly grants) and broader cost pressures. [New York – Community Perspectives]\n\n- **Cleveland District:**  \n  - Cleveland’s survey of nonprofits shows **declining funding** and explicit **hiring restraint** due to federal grant uncertainty, even as community organizations worked with clients who increasingly received only part‑time, low‑benefit job offers and as formerly incarcerated individuals had a harder time securing employment. This suggests **rising labor‑market precarity among clients**, which was caused by broader economic and policy conditions and, in turn, increased the complexity and intensity of nonprofit casework. [Cleveland – Community Conditions]\n\nPutting these together, the cross‑district pattern is: **federal policy‑related funding and benefit changes + local economic stress → higher demand for social services (especially in Dallas and St. Louis) + less stable funding (notably in New York and Cleveland) → nonprofits either stretch resources, tap reserves, or alter hiring and revenue strategies to cope.**\n\n6. What is *not* directly supported in the excerpts\n\nTo keep the causal story evidence‑based, some previously implied links must be qualified:\n\n- The current excerpts do **not** directly document:  \n  - San Francisco nonprofits experiencing higher demand **because of** immigration‑policy shifts,  \n  - Dallas nonprofits specifically launching **fee‑based e‑learning or e‑commerce** (only a general statement that some are exploring alternate revenue streams), or  \n  - Education‑sector layoffs tied explicitly to **federal grant cuts**.\n\nAny such statements would require additional sources beyond the provided Beige Book text.\n\n7. Overall causal picture across districts\n\nTaken together, the Beige Book narratives show that federal policy changes affected nonprofits across multiple districts mainly through three central cause‑and‑effect pathways:\n\n1. **Benefit and safety‑net policy changes** (SNAP, Medicaid, and other federal programs) **caused** greater hardship for low‑income households; this **resulted in** higher demand for nonprofit services (food, housing, health care) and strained the finances of providers in districts like New York and Boston.\n2. **Uncertainty and cuts in federal grants** **caused** unstable and declining funding for nonprofits; this **resulted in** nonprofits in districts like Cleveland (and more generally New York) drawing on reserves, delaying or freezing hiring, and operating with reduced capacity just as needs were rising.\n3. **Federal policies that raised costs or constrained labor supply** (tariffs, immigration changes, and rising insurance/operating costs) **caused** higher prices for households and higher expenses for nonprofits, as well as labor shortages in key sectors; this **resulted in** both more people needing help and higher unit costs for nonprofits to deliver that help.\n\nBecause the Beige Book is qualitative and district‑specific, it does not provide formal cross‑district metrics or a rigorous evaluation, but the narratives from New York, Cleveland, Boston, Dallas, and St. Louis consistently support this overall causal pattern: **federal policy shifts tightened both the finances of vulnerable households and the funding conditions of nonprofits, leading to simultaneous surges in demand and constraints on nonprofit capacity across multiple districts.**",

      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the expected answer:\n1) New York District: nonprofits faced challenges from unpredictable funding and reductions in federal benefit programs; a community health‑care center reported financial distress among Medicaid patients.\n2) Cleveland District: nonprofit sector was not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants.\n3) Boston District: cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health‑care sectors.\n\nCheck against system answer:\n- New York: The system answer clearly states nonprofits faced \"unpredictable funding\" and \"a reduction in federal benefit programs\" and that a community health‑care center saw rising financial distress among Medicaid patients, straining finances. This matches the ground truth.\n- Cleveland: The system answer explicitly says that a survey found decreased funding and that \"the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants,\" matching the ground truth.\n- Boston: The expected answer says that cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health‑care sectors. The system answer mentions Boston in terms of planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid, higher food‑pantry demand, etc., but it does **not** mention that cuts to federal grants contributed to layoffs in education and health care. In fact, the system explicitly notes in section 6 that the excerpts do not directly document \"education‑sector layoffs tied explicitly to federal grant cuts.\" Thus it omits this key expected fact and even contradicts it by saying it is not documented in the evidence set it is using.\n\nThe rest of the system answer adds many extra, generally accurate details, but the Boston layoffs point—one of the three core elements of the expected answer—is missing/denied. The information that is present is accurate, but the answer is incomplete relative to the expected answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is partially correct, not fully correct.",

      "expected_answer": "Four sectors reported labor shortages due to immigration policy changes: hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing. The St. Louis District explicitly stated that contacts continue to report immigration policies resulting in labor shortages. The Boston District noted retail and tourism contacts worried about next summer's labor supply given expected reductions in seasonal visas, with Maine and Vermont seeing increased labor market slack.",
      "system_answer": "- **Agriculture**  \n  - **National level:** Cited as facing labor strains due to recent immigration policy changes.  \n  - **Atlanta District:** Highlighted prominently in **south Georgia agriculture**, where immigration-policy changes are linked directly to worker shortages.  \n  - **St. Louis District:** Reports **agriculture** experiencing labor shortages tied to immigration policies and enforcement, noted repeatedly in both the Summary of Economic Activity and Labor Markets sections.  \n  - **San Francisco District:** Mentions agriculture in the context of immigration-related labor tightness.  \n\n- **Hospitality / Leisure and Hospitality**  \n  - **National level:** Hospitality and leisure & hospitality are explicitly described as strained by recent immigration policy changes.  \n  - **Atlanta District:** Emphasizes **hospitality in south Georgia** as being affected by immigration-policy-driven worker shortages.  \n  - **New York District:** Notes labor difficulties in **leisure and hospitality** attributed to “shifts in immigration policy,” though this is a secondary, less prominent theme compared with other issues.  \n\n- **Construction**  \n  - **National level:** Construction is identified as one of the sectors experiencing labor shortfalls related to immigration policy changes.  \n  - **St. Louis District:** Prominently reports **construction** labor shortages tied to immigration policies and deportation fears, making this a central theme of its labor-market discussion.  \n  - **Philadelphia District:** A construction contact anticipates a **significant labor shortage** if demand rises, linking this to immigration-related constraints; this is notable but framed more as a potential or emerging issue than as widespread current shortages.  \n  - **New York District:** Briefly cites **construction** as having hiring difficulties due to shifts in immigration policy, mentioned but not as a primary district-wide concern.  \n\n- **Manufacturing**  \n  - **National level:** Manufacturing is included among sectors strained by immigration policy changes.  \n  - **St. Louis District:** Clearly and repeatedly states that **manufacturing** faces labor shortages due to immigration policies and enforcement (including deportation fears), making this one of the most prominently discussed district-sector combinations.\n\n- **Districts where this was most prominently mentioned**  \n  - **St. Louis District:** Most prominent and explicit; repeatedly links immigration policies to labor shortages in **manufacturing, construction, and agriculture** in both the overall summary and labor-market detail sections.  \n  - **Atlanta District:** Prominent regional emphasis in **south Georgia**, especially in **agriculture and hospitality**, as being heavily affected by immigration-related worker shortages.  \n  - **Philadelphia District:** Mentions construction-sector concerns as a **potential** significant labor shortage tied to immigration constraints—important but less central and more conditional.  \n  - **New York District:** Brief mentions of immigration-policy-related hiring difficulties in **construction and leisure & hospitality**, making it a secondary concern rather than a major theme.\n\n[Source for all items: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Specific sectors with labor shortages due to immigration policy changes: hospitality, agriculture, construction, manufacturing.\n2) St. Louis District explicitly stated that contacts continue to report immigration policies resulting in labor shortages.\n3) Boston District: retail and tourism contacts worried about next summer's labor supply given expected reductions in seasonal visas, with Maine and Vermont seeing increased labor market slack.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer correctly lists the four sectors: agriculture, hospitality/leisure, construction, manufacturing – this matches the expected sectors.\n- It correctly identifies St. Louis as a district where immigration-policy-related labor shortages are prominent and ties this to multiple sectors (agriculture, construction, manufacturing). This aligns with the expected answer’s emphasis that St. Louis explicitly reports immigration policies resulting in labor shortages.\n- However, the system answer does not mention the Boston District at all, nor does it mention retail and tourism, nor Maine and Vermont, nor the seasonal visa concern. These are key elements of the expected answer about where this was “most prominently mentioned.”\n- Instead, the system introduces Atlanta, Philadelphia, New York, and various national-level and district-level details that are not in the ground truth. Since we judge against the expected answer, these are extra and potentially fabricated with respect to the provided reference. But they do not directly contradict the expected answer; they just go beyond it.\n\nBecause the system answer includes all the sectors correctly and captures St. Louis as a prominent district but omits the Boston-related details that are explicitly required, and there is no direct contradiction of the expected facts, the response is incomplete but not factually opposed to the ground truth.\n\nThus it is partially correct rather than fully correct or incorrect.\n",

      "expected_answer": "Responses to tariff-induced costs varied by sector: In manufacturing and retail trades, some firms fully passed higher import costs along to customers. Other firms facing tariff-induced cost pressures kept selling prices largely unchanged to preserve market share and due to pushback from price-sensitive clients. In Chicago, a retail industry analyst expected peak tariff impact in the first half of 2026.",
      "system_answer": "Here is a sector‑by‑sector, side‑by‑side comparison of how firms adjusted pricing when tariffs raised their costs, based on the Beige Book evidence you provided.\n\n---\n### 1. Manufacturing & Wholesale vs. Retail\n\n**Use of direct pass‑through (raising prices or adding surcharges)**  \n- **Manufacturing & Wholesale:** Multiple reports show relatively **more direct pass‑through**:\n  - Upstate New York: A **specialty appliance manufacturer** “hiked their prices for the second time this year to account for the impact of tariffs on their costs,” and an **upstate brewer** said higher ingredient and packaging costs were “getting passed along to the consumer” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Prices].\n  - Cleveland: “Several **manufacturers and wholesalers** introduced **surcharges** to cover additional costs related to tariffs” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Prices].\n  - Minneapolis: “Several manufacturers reported that they **recently increased prices in response to tariffs** or planned future increases” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Minneapolis > Prices].\n  \n  In contrast, **Retail:** Pass‑through tended to be **more selective and calibrated**:\n  - Cleveland: Many retailers “**offered discounts or [raised] prices only on select items**,” indicating partial, item‑specific pass‑through rather than blanket increases [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Prices].\n  - New York: A **major retailer** “adjust[ed] price increases based on the **demand elasticity for each item**,” explicitly tailoring pass‑through to how sensitive customers are to price changes [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Prices].\n\n**Willingness to absorb costs (holding prices to gain or protect market share)**  \n- **Manufacturing & Wholesale:** There is clear evidence of **both** pass‑through and absorption within this sector:\n  - Cleveland: Some manufacturers “**held prices steady despite increased costs to try to gain market share**,” directly absorbing tariff‑related cost increases [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Prices].\n  - Richmond: A **fuse box manufacturer** “reconfigured their products to **cut costs and lower their prices**,” absorbing or offsetting tariff pressures through cost‑cutting rather than price hikes; at the same time, a **furniture manufacturer** reported tariffs were **increasing their prices** amid weaker demand, implying at least partial pass‑through [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Richmond > Manufacturing].\n\n  In contrast, **Retail:** Absorption typically took the form of **selective increases and heavy discounting**, rather than outright price freezes across the board:\n  - Cleveland: By “raising prices only on select items” while offering discounts on others, retailers appear to **partially absorb cost increases** where demand is more price‑sensitive, and pass through more where demand is inelastic [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Prices].\n  - National/summary evidence: Consumers—especially lower‑ and middle‑income households—sought **discounts and promotions** as prices rose, forcing many retailers to compete on deals and promotions rather than fully passing higher costs through nationwide [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary].\n\n**Pricing mechanisms (surcharges vs. list prices vs. product redesign)**  \n- **Manufacturing & Wholesale:** Firms often used **explicit, tariff‑linked mechanisms**:\n  - Cleveland manufacturers/wholesalers implemented **surcharges** specifically “to cover additional costs related to tariffs” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Prices].\n  - Upstate New York manufacturers simply **raised list prices** (e.g., the appliance maker’s second price hike of the year) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Prices].\n  - Richmond’s fuse box maker used **product reconfiguration and cost cutting** to lower prices while coping with tariff‑driven costs [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Richmond > Manufacturing].\n\n  In contrast, **Retail:** Firms relied more on **micro‑pricing and promotions** rather than formal surcharges:\n  - New York’s large retailer explicitly applied **item‑by‑item elasticity pricing**—i.e., higher pass‑through on less price‑sensitive goods, lower or no pass‑through on more price‑sensitive goods [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Prices].\n  - Cleveland retailers combined **selective list‑price increases** on some products with **discounts** on others, effectively blending partial pass‑through with absorption [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Prices].\n\n---\n### 2. Manufacturing & Wholesale vs. Services (including Restaurants)\n\n**Exposure and ability to pass through tariff costs**  \n- **Manufacturing & Wholesale:** More directly exposed to imported inputs, and often **able to justify price increases**:\n  - New York and Minneapolis reports show manufacturers **explicitly tying price hikes to tariffs** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Prices; Minneapolis > Prices].\n  - Cleveland manufacturers/wholesalers deployed **surcharges** and some still raised list prices, though others held prices for strategic reasons [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Prices].\n\n  In contrast, **Services & Restaurants:** Evidence suggests **more constrained pass‑through**, and in some cases only indirect reactions:\n  - New York: “Some **restaurants** noted escalating costs for food—particularly beef—and imported wine were **hurting their businesses**” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Prices]. This shows cost pressure, but the text does **not** say they systematically raised prices; the implication is limited pricing power or that they were reluctant to fully pass these costs on.\n  - Other service firms: The available excerpts mention a New York specialty contractor facing higher costs from non‑tariff sources (e.g., congestion pricing), but not clear tariff‑linked price responses for most services [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Prices].\n\n**Tactics used when demand is price‑sensitive**  \n- **Manufacturing & Wholesale:** When facing strong customer price sensitivity, firms often **changed products or absorbed costs** rather than pushing through full tariff increases:\n  - Richmond examples show manufacturers responding to sensitive customers by reconfiguring products (fuse box producer) or dealing with demand shifts toward cheaper alternatives (engine‑parts manufacturer) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Richmond > Manufacturing].\n\n  In contrast, **Services & Restaurants:** The text gives **fewer concrete tactics**:\n  - New York restaurants experiencing higher input costs are described as “hurt” by those costs, but there is no explicit evidence they resorted to menu surcharges, portion changes, or recipe changes in this Beige Book; earlier inferences about portion control or recipe adjustments (Boston, San Francisco) are **not directly supported in these citations** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Prices].\n\n**Degree of documented tariff pass‑through**  \n- **Manufacturing & Wholesale:** Multiple Districts document **clear, tariff‑linked price moves** (surcharges, repeated increases, explicit references to passing costs along) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Prices; Cleveland > Prices; Minneapolis > Prices].\n\n  In contrast, **Services & Restaurants:** Tariff impacts on pricing are **less explicitly documented**:\n  - We see **elevated input costs** and business strain in New York restaurants, but **no explicit description of how much, or whether, those costs were passed through** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Prices].\n  - Other service industries in the provided excerpts have **little or no direct mention** of tariff‑driven price changes.\n\n---\n### 3. Domestic Manufacturers/Retailers vs. Foreign Producers (Pharmaceuticals and other goods)\n\n**Strategy: passing tariffs on vs. absorbing them**  \n- **Domestic manufacturers & retailers:** Used a **mix** of pass‑through and absorption:\n  - Domestic manufacturers (appliances, brewing, various Minneapolis firms) often **raised prices** or employed **surcharges** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Prices; Cleveland > Prices; Minneapolis > Prices].\n  - Other domestic manufacturers (Cleveland) **held prices steady** despite higher costs to gain market share [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Prices].\n  - Domestic retailers blended **selective price hikes** with **discounts** and elasticity‑based pricing [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Prices; Cleveland > Prices].\n\n  In contrast, **Foreign producers (notably in pharmaceuticals and some other goods):** Evidence shows **more deliberate cost absorption** to protect U.S. market share:\n  - New York: A pharmaceutical company reported that **foreign manufacturers were absorbing tariff costs to maintain market share and production levels** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Prices].\n  - Cleveland: Two contacts said **foreign producers were factoring in tariffs and cutting prices accordingly to retain market share** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Prices].\n\n**Market‑share motivation**  \n- **Domestic firms:** Some manufacturers explicitly held prices to **gain** market share (Cleveland), trading margin for volume [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Prices].\n\n  In contrast, **Foreign firms:** They absorbed tariffs explicitly to **protect existing** share:\n  - By cutting prices or refraining from raising them, foreign producers sought to remain competitive despite tariffs [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Prices; Cleveland > Prices].\n\n---\n### 4. Summary of Sectoral Differences in Pricing Strategies under Tariff Shocks\n\nPutting these side‑by‑side:\n\n- **Manufacturing & Wholesale** tended to:\n  - Use **explicit pass‑through tools**—list‑price hikes and tariff‑specific surcharges.\n  - Sometimes **hold prices or redesign products** where customers were highly price‑sensitive, absorbing some costs.\n  - Exhibit **clear, documented links** between tariffs and price changes in several Districts [Sources: BeigeBook_20251015, New York, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Richmond].\n\n- **Retailers** tended to:\n  - Implement **partial, highly selective pass‑through**, varying by product and demand elasticity.\n  - Use **discounts and promotions** to keep price‑sensitive customers, thereby absorbing part of tariff‑driven cost increases.\n  - Refrain from broad, across‑the‑board tariff surcharges, unlike many manufacturers and wholesalers [Sources: BeigeBook_20251015, New York, Cleveland, National Summary].\n\n- **Services & Restaurants** tended to:\n  - Face **cost pressures** (e.g., higher food and imported wine costs for New York restaurants) with **less clear ability to pass them through**.\n  - Show **limited, explicitly documented tariff‑linked pricing responses** in the excerpts; much of the evidence stops at describing rising costs rather than concrete menu or fee changes [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Prices].\n\n- **Foreign Producers (esp. in pharma and some other goods)** tended to:\n  - **Absorb a larger share** of tariff costs, sometimes **cutting prices** to maintain or defend U.S. market share.\n  - Contrast with many domestic firms that more frequently relied on **surcharges or direct price increases** while selectively absorbing costs for strategic reasons [Sources: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Prices; Cleveland > Prices].\n\nOverall, tariff‑induced cost increases did not translate into uniform price hikes. Manufacturing and wholesale sectors showed more overt, tariff‑linked pass‑through (with some strategic absorption), retailers engaged in fine‑grained, partial pass‑through and discounting, service sectors—especially restaurants—appear more constrained with less documented pass‑through, and foreign producers often absorbed tariffs outright to preserve U.S. market share.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Responses varied by sector.\n2) In manufacturing and retail, some firms fully passed higher import costs on to customers.\n3) Other firms kept selling prices largely unchanged to preserve market share and because of pushback from price‑sensitive clients.\n4) In Chicago, a retail industry analyst expected the peak tariff impact in the first half of 2026.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer clearly states sectoral variation and, for manufacturing and (to a lesser degree) retail, describes examples of firms passing on tariff costs (price hikes, surcharges) and others holding prices/absorbing costs, including to gain market share and in response to price‑sensitive customers. That aligns with points (1)–(3) in substance, even if it is more detailed and uses district examples rather than the brief summary in the expected answer.\n- However, the system answer does not mention anything about Chicago or a retail industry analyst expecting the peak tariff impact in the first half of 2026 (point 4). This is a missing key detail.\n- There are no direct contradictions with the expected answer; the added detail is consistent with the general picture.\n\nBecause the answer correctly captures the core qualitative behavior (pass‑through vs absorption, market‑share motives, price sensitivity, sectoral differences) but omits the explicit Chicago/2026 expectation, it is incomplete but not wrong.\n\nTherefore the correct verdict is PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

      "question": "What was the relationship between federal policy and electric vehicle sales, and how did this affect overall auto sales?",
      "expected_answer": "Auto sales were boosted in some districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September. However, in the Chicago District, light vehicle sales declined overall, especially for EVs following the end of federal tax credits. This shows the federal tax credit created a pre-expiration demand surge followed by a post-expiration decline.",
      "system_answer": "Federal policy and electric vehicle (EV) sales were linked through the design and timing of a federal EV tax credit, and this link, in turn, affected overall auto sales. The relationships are causal and run in a chain:\n\n1. **Federal policy → EV buying behavior**  \n   - A **federal EV tax credit was scheduled to expire at the end of September**.  \n   - This impending expiration **caused consumers to accelerate or “pull forward” EV purchases** in order to take advantage of the credit before it disappeared.  \n   - As a result, **EV sales temporarily surged**:  \n     - Multiple Districts (including Philadelphia, Atlanta, Boston, and Chicago) reported **robust or increased EV sales explicitly tied to the impending end of the federal tax incentives**. This indicates that the **timing of the policy change itself**—not just the existence of the credit—drove a wave of last‑minute EV purchases. [BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n2. **EV sales surge → boost to overall auto sales**  \n   The policy-driven EV surge then **fed through to total auto sales**:\n   - The **National Summary** states that **“auto sales were boosted in some Districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September.”** This means that **higher EV demand directly caused overall auto sales to be higher** than they otherwise would have been in those areas.  \n   - In **Chicago**, the Federal Reserve Bank reported that **“New light vehicle sales were brisk, reflecting a combination of strong underlying demand and the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases.”** This was caused by the upcoming end of EV tax incentives, which **contributed to stronger overall new‑vehicle sales**, not just EV sales.  \n   - In the **Atlanta District**, automobile dealers experienced a **“robust surge in new electric vehicle (EV) sales” ahead of the expiration of the EV tax credit**. This robust EV demand **helped support overall auto sales** in that District.  \n   - As a result, **overall auto sales in some Districts were propped up or lifted by the EV surge**, even where broader consumer spending was under strain.\n\n3. **Mediating role of EV sales (linking policy to total auto sales)**  \n   Putting the chain together:\n   - **Cause 1 (Policy change):** The **scheduled end of the federal EV tax credit** created a deadline.  \n   - **Effect on EVs:** That deadline **caused a spike in EV demand** as consumers rushed to buy before losing the incentive (“strong demand,” “robust surge,” “brisk” sales tied to the end of incentives).  \n   - **Effect on overall autos:** This EV spike **caused overall auto sales to be “boosted” or “brisk” in some Districts**, because EVs are part of total new vehicle sales. Without that pull‑forward in EV purchases, overall auto sales would likely have been weaker, although the Beige Book does not quantify by how much.\n\n4. **Scope and limits of the effect**  \n   - The effect is described as occurring in **“some Districts,” not nationwide**, so the **boost to overall auto sales was regionally concentrated**, with **Chicago and Atlanta** explicitly documented and other affected Districts unnamed in the excerpts.  \n   - The Beige Book provides **qualitative** descriptions—“strong demand,” “robust surge,” “brisk” sales, “boosted” auto sales—but **does not give numerical magnitudes** or a full District‑by‑District breakdown.  \n   - References to specific places like **New Hampshire** or to detailed counterfactuals (“sales would have fallen by X% without EV demand”) cannot be confirmed from the supplied text and thus remain unspecified.\n\nIn summary, **federal EV tax policy caused a time‑limited rush in EV purchases, and this EV surge in turn caused overall auto sales to be stronger in some Districts than they otherwise would have been.** EV sales were the key mediating channel through which the federal tax credit’s pending expiration translated into a temporary boost in total auto sales.\n",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) There was a federal EV tax credit scheduled to expire at the end of September.\n2) Ahead of expiration, this produced strong demand / a surge in EV sales, which boosted overall auto sales in some districts.\n3) After expiration, in the Chicago District, light vehicle sales declined overall, especially EVs.\n4) Hence, the policy created a pre‑expiration demand surge followed by a post‑expiration decline.\n\nWhat the system answer includes correctly:\n- Describes the federal EV tax credit expiring at the end of September.\n- Explains that this impending expiration caused a rush / pull‑forward in EV purchases.\n- States that this spike in EV demand boosted overall auto sales in some districts, citing the National Summary.\n- Notes regional scope and that the effect is not nationwide.\n\nWhat is missing or incorrect relative to the expected answer:\n- The critical post‑expiration effect in Chicago is not correctly described. The expected answer says: in Chicago, light vehicle sales declined overall, especially EVs, following the end of the tax credits.\n- The system answer instead claims Chicago had “brisk” new light vehicle sales reflecting strong demand and the end of tax incentives, implying a boost, not a decline. That contradicts the expected answer’s description of post‑expiration decline, which is a key part of the question (it asks about the relationship and how it affected overall auto sales, explicitly involving both pre‑ and post‑expiration periods).\n- The system answer does not mention any decline in EV or overall auto sales after expiration; it only discusses the pre‑expiration boost, thus omitting half of the core relationship (surge then drop) and introducing a contradictory portrayal of Chicago.\n\nBecause there is a direct contradiction about the Chicago District’s sales pattern and the answer omits the key post‑expiration decline effect, the response is not just incomplete but includes inaccurate information relative to the ground truth.\n\nVerdict: incorrect.",

      "question": "What were the multiple factors affecting labor costs, and how did they interact with wage growth?",
      "expected_answer": "Wages grew at a modest to moderate pace across all districts. However, labor cost pressures intensified due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses. Additionally, some contacts in the Chicago District reported moderate increases in nonlabor costs including energy and higher prices for raw materials. This meant total compensation costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.",
      "system_answer": "Labor costs and wage growth were driven by several interacting forces, and the Beige Book describes clear cause‑and‑effect chains.\n\n---\n## 1. Immigration policy changes → Labor shortages → Upward wage and labor‑cost pressure (in specific sectors)\n\n- **Cause:** Recent changes to immigration policies reduced labor supply in sectors such as hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing in several Districts, and created staffing disruptions where visas were revoked or workers feared enforcement.\n  - Nationally, labor supply in these sectors was “strained … due to recent changes to immigration policies.”\n  - District examples (e.g., Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis) describe fewer foreign‑born workers, revoked visas, and replacement hiring needs.\n\n- **Effect on wages and labor costs:**\n  - This was caused by a **negative labor‑supply shock**: fewer available workers in affected sectors.\n  - As a result, employers in those sectors faced **higher labor costs**, often via:\n    - Higher wages or better terms needed to attract and retain scarce workers.\n    - Extra expenses for overtime, retraining, and rehiring when workers left or lost visa status.\n  - Thus, even though overall wage growth was only modest to moderate, **sector‑ and region‑specific shortages pushed labor costs up faster than the average in those constrained markets.**\n\n---\n## 2. Weaker demand, elevated uncertainty, and AI investment → Muted labor demand → Contained aggregate wage growth\n\n- **Cause:** At the national level, firms reported:\n  - **Weaker product and service demand** and **elevated economic uncertainty**.\n  - In some cases, **increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies** that allowed reductions in headcount.\n\n- **Effect on labor demand:**\n  - This was caused by a **demand‑side slowdown** and new technology substituting for some labor.\n  - As a result, many employers:\n    - Reduced headcounts through layoffs and attrition.\n    - Slowed or froze hiring.\n    - Reported **“muted” demand for labor** and **improved labor availability** in general.\n\n- **Effect on wages:**\n  - Because firms were not aggressively competing for workers overall, **upward pressure on wages was limited**.\n  - As a result, **wages still grew in all reporting Districts, but only at a modest to moderate pace**, with some Districts (e.g., Philadelphia, San Francisco, Chicago) explicitly reporting easing or modest wage inflation.\n  - In short: **weak demand + better general availability of workers dampened wage acceleration**, partially offsetting the upward wage pressures seen in shortage‑affected sectors.\n\n---\n## 3. Outsized increases in employer‑sponsored health insurance → Intensified labor cost pressures despite modest wage growth\n\n- **Cause:** Across all reporting Districts, employers faced **“outsized increases in employer‑sponsored health insurance expenses.”** District reports also repeatedly cite:\n  - Rising **employee health care premiums**.\n  - Increases in **business and liability insurance** and other health‑related costs.\n\n- **Direct effect on labor costs:**\n  - This was caused by **nonwage benefit costs rising faster than base pay**.\n  - As a result, the Beige Book notes that **“labor cost pressures intensified in recent weeks due to outsized increases in employer‑sponsored health insurance expenses,”** even though wage growth was only modest to moderate.\n  - In places like Chicago, contacts explicitly said **wages and benefits were up modestly**, but **health insurance premiums were rising noticeably**, raising the total cost of employing workers.\n\n- **Interaction with wage growth:**\n  - Modest wage growth on its own would suggest contained labor cost pressures.\n  - However, because health insurance costs surged, **total labor costs grew faster than wage rates alone**.\n  - As a result, firms could experience significant labor cost inflation **without granting large wage increases**, which may have:\n    - Constrained their willingness or ability to raise wages further.\n    - Encouraged some to favor temporary/part‑time hiring or other cost‑controlling staffing strategies.\n\n---\n## 4. Institutional and sector‑specific factors → Localized wage increases within a generally modest environment\n\n### a. Union negotiations in health care\n\n- **Cause:** In at least one case (San Francisco District), **recent labor union contract negotiations in health care** led to higher wages.\n\n- **Effect:**\n  - This was caused by **institutional bargaining outcomes**, not broad market conditions.\n  - As a result, **health care wages in that District rose specifically due to union contracts**, even while overall regional wage pressures were described as slight or softening.\n\n### b. Persistent shortages in specialized and low‑wage roles\n\n- **Cause:** In the San Francisco District, wage pressures softened in many white‑collar sectors (banking, consulting, retail), but **persisted for highly specialized AI technology positions and some lower‑wage construction and manufacturing jobs**.\n\n- **Effect:**\n  - This was caused by **ongoing skill scarcity and sector‑specific labor tightness**.\n  - As a result, wages in those particular jobs continued to face **upward pressure**, standing out against a backdrop of generally moderate wage growth.\n\n---\n## 5. Nonwage operating costs and other inputs → Overall cost pressures that shape wage decisions\n\n### a. Childcare sector (Kansas City) – Nonlabor costs dominating pricing\n\n- **Cause:** Childcare providers reported that **nonlabor costs** (unspecified mix of inputs) remained the main driver of their prices, while **staff wage growth was relatively muted**.\n\n- **Effect on labor costs and wages:**\n  - This was caused by **high nonlabor operating expenses** (e.g., facilities, supplies, utilities, insurance), though the Beige Book does not itemize them.\n  - As a result:\n    - Childcare prices stayed high (e.g., infant‑toddler care costing more than in‑state university tuition), **even though wages for staff were not rising rapidly**.\n    - This illustrates that **overall cost pressure can be intense even where wage growth is weak**; firms may hold down wages to cope with high nonlabor costs, but total service prices and cost burdens remain elevated.\n\n### b. Other input costs (energy, materials, tariffs, utilities, technology, insurance)\n\n- **Cause:** In several Districts (e.g., Chicago, Cleveland), firms faced higher costs for:\n  - Energy.\n  - Metals and raw materials (sometimes tied to tariffs).\n  - Technology and insurance.\n  - Utilities.\n\n- **Effect on interaction with wage growth:**\n  - This was caused by **broad input‑cost inflation outside of labor**.\n  - As a result, firms operated under tighter cost constraints, which likely:\n    - Limited how much they were willing to raise wages.\n    - Increased the relative impact of any wage and benefit increases on overall cost structures.\n  - However, the Beige Book does **not** document explicit statements such as “we raised wages less because tariffs/energy costs went up,” so this link is economic inference rather than directly quoted.\n\n---\n## 6. Overall relationship: How all these factors jointly shaped wage growth and labor costs\n\nPutting the pieces together, the observed pattern in the Beige Book is the product of **offsetting forces on wages**, combined with **strong upward pressure from nonwage labor costs**:\n\n1. **Upward wage pressures from tight pockets of the labor market**\n   - Immigration‑related labor shortages in hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing.\n   - Persistent demand for specialized AI roles and some low‑wage blue‑collar jobs.\n   - Union contract negotiations in sectors like health care.\n   \n   → These factors **caused localized and sector‑specific wage increases** and higher labor costs where labor was scarce or bargaining power was strong.\n\n2. **Downward or moderating pressures on aggregate wage growth**\n   - Weaker aggregate demand, elevated uncertainty, and some AI‑enabled substitution.\n   - Muted hiring and improved general labor availability.\n\n   → These conditions **caused firms to restrain wage growth overall**, resulting in wages rising **modestly to moderately across all Districts**, rather than rapidly.\n\n3. **Nonwage labor costs amplifying total labor cost growth**\n   - Outsized increases in employer‑sponsored health insurance expenses nationwide.\n   - Rising health‑related and insurance costs reported across multiple Districts.\n\n   → These cost increases **caused total labor costs to intensify** across all Districts **even though wage growth remained modest**. The composition of labor costs shifted: benefits (especially health insurance) became a larger and faster‑growing share of total compensation.\n\n4. **Other nonlabor inputs and sector‑specific operating costs influencing wage decisions**\n   - High nonlabor operating costs in sectors like childcare, and higher input costs from tariffs, energy, utilities, and technology.\n\n   → These pressures **constrained firms’ ability or willingness to raise wages**, but also meant that **overall cost pressures and prices could remain high even where wage growth was muted**.\n\nIn sum, **wage growth and labor costs did not move one‑for‑one**. Wages rose modestly to moderately across all Districts, reflecting the net effect of tightness in some labor markets and weakness in others. At the same time, **outsized increases in health insurance and other nonwage components caused total labor costs to rise more sharply than wages alone would suggest**, while immigration‑related shortages, union negotiations, and sector‑specific tightness created pockets of stronger wage and cost growth within this generally moderate national picture.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Wages grew at a modest to moderate pace across all districts.\n2) Labor cost pressures intensified primarily because of outsized increases in employer‑sponsored health insurance expenses.\n3) Some Chicago contacts reported moderate increases in nonlabor costs, including energy and higher prices for raw materials.\n4) As a result, total compensation costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer does state that wages rose modestly to moderately across districts (matches fact 1) and that total labor costs rose faster than wages due largely to outsized increases in employer‑sponsored health insurance (matches facts 2 and 4). It also mentions that in places like Chicago, wages and benefits were up modestly but health insurance premiums were rising noticeably, which is directionally consistent with the idea that nonwage costs intensified labor cost pressures.\n- However, the expected answer is narrowly focused: multiple factors affecting labor costs were (a) modest‑to‑moderate wage growth, (b) outsized increases in employer‑sponsored health insurance, and (c) some increases in nonlabor costs such as energy and raw materials (Chicago). The interaction requested is specifically that total compensation costs rose faster than wages because of these nonwage components.\n- The system answer introduces a large number of additional mechanisms—immigration policy changes, weaker product demand, AI investment, union negotiations, sector‑specific shortages, childcare sector specifics, tariffs, broad nonlabor input costs, etc. Many of these are not in the expected answer. Some are likely hallucinated relative to the ground truth: the question/context as framed only supports health insurance and some nonlabor cost increases as the factors; detailed stories about immigration enforcement, AI substitution, childcare pricing versus tuition, and sector‑specific union outcomes go well beyond, and they are presented as if drawn from the same Beige Book passage. That makes the answer misleading with respect to the narrow question.\n- Moreover, the answer dilutes the key point by making wage growth seem heavily determined by many offsetting forces, when the expected answer emphasizes only that wage growth was modest/moderate and that labor costs were pushed higher mainly by health insurance and some nonlabor costs. While the system does contain the core idea about health insurance driving labor costs faster than wage growth, it surrounds it with many other mechanisms that are not supported by the expected answer and are asserted as factual.\n\nGiven the rubric, the presence of substantial, specific, and likely unsupported additional mechanisms counts as hallucinated/incorrect content, even though some core elements are correct. Therefore the answer cannot be graded as merely partial; it is misleading and overclaims facts beyond the ground truth context.",

      "question": "How did consumer spending patterns affect different restaurant segments in the Chicago District?",
      "expected_answer": "In the Chicago District, leisure and hospitality sales were mixed, with softness in some travel-related categories including airlines and hotels, but increased spending at restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments. Demand from restaurant groups remained solid, as indicated by commercial real estate leasing activity.",
      "system_answer": "Consumer spending patterns in the Chicago District affected restaurant segments through a clear chain of cause and effect:\n\n1. **Overall consumer spending rose modestly**  \n   - Households in the Chicago District increased their overall spending slightly. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - This was caused by generally stable economic conditions that allowed consumers to maintain or modestly increase discretionary outlays.\n\n2. **Households redirected discretionary spending within leisure and hospitality**  \n   - Spending on some travel-related categories—such as airlines and hotels—was soft. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - This softness was caused by consumers pulling back on higher-cost, travel-intensive leisure activities.  \n   - As a result, part of that discretionary budget was redirected toward more routine, locally accessible options—especially restaurants.\n\n3. **Boost to quick-service segments (fast food and fast casual)**  \n   - Spending increased at fast food and fast casual restaurants. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - This was caused by:  \n     - Consumers favoring lower-ticket, more affordable dining choices when trimming bigger travel and vacation expenses.  \n     - The convenience and lower perceived “commitment” of quick-service options when overall leisure and hospitality spending was mixed.  \n   - As a result, quick-service restaurant activity strengthened, with higher sales relative to other leisure categories that saw softness.\n\n4. **Strength in family dining restaurants**  \n   - Spending also increased at family dining establishments. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - This was caused by households reallocating entertainment dollars from travel (airlines, hotels) toward local, family-oriented outings like sit-down but affordable meals.  \n   - As a result, the family dining segment experienced stronger demand, even while the broader leisure and hospitality sector was described as “mixed.”\n\n5. **Differentiated impact across restaurant and hospitality segments**  \n   - Overall leisure and hospitality sales were mixed, with particular weakness in travel-related businesses. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - This was caused by consumers selectively cutting back: they reduced spending on more expensive, discretionary travel while maintaining or increasing spending on dining out locally.  \n   - As a result, restaurant segments—specifically fast food, fast casual, and family dining—outperformed other parts of leisure and hospitality, benefiting directly from the way consumers reshaped their spending patterns.\n\nIn summary, modestly higher overall consumer spending, combined with a shift away from travel-related expenditures, **caused** increased spending at fast food, fast casual, and family dining restaurants in the Chicago District. **As a result**, these restaurant segments saw stronger activity even as some other leisure and hospitality categories remained soft.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Leisure and hospitality sales in the Chicago District were mixed.\n2) There was softness in some travel-related categories, including airlines and hotels.\n3) Spending increased at restaurants in fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments.\n4) Demand from restaurant groups remained solid, as indicated by commercial real estate leasing activity.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer correctly states that overall leisure and hospitality sales were mixed and that travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels were soft. This matches points (1) and (2).\n- It clearly identifies increased spending at fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments, matching point (3).\n- It further explains that these segments outperformed other parts of leisure and hospitality and describes a shift of discretionary spending from travel to local dining; these are elaborations but not contradictory.\n- However, it does not mention demand from restaurant groups being indicated by commercial real estate leasing activity at all, so point (4) is missing.\n- There are no clear factual contradictions with the ground truth, but one element of the expected answer (leasing activity evidence) is absent.\n\nGiven that all present facts are consistent but one key aspect is missing, the answer is incomplete rather than wrong or abstaining.",

      "expected_answer": "Lower interest rates had positive effects across multiple sectors: In Cleveland, commercial construction and financial services saw uptick in demand due to lower rates. In Chicago, financial conditions loosened modestly with business loan volumes increasing. However, the impact was mixed - while some reports noted improved business lending, residential real estate remained weak in Dallas and home sales were flat in Boston. The housing market's response to lower rates was more muted than commercial sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Lower interest rates had **causal but uneven effects** on interest‑sensitive sectors across districts. Where the Beige Book is explicit (especially Cleveland), we can clearly trace cause‑and‑effect; elsewhere, effects remain more generic or are not documented in the provided excerpts.\n\n---\n\n1. Cleveland District: clear, documented rate-driven responses\n\n- **Cause: Decline in short‑term interest rates**  \n  The Cleveland report explicitly links lower rates to stronger activity:  \n  • “Commercial construction and financial services contacts noted an uptick in demand **because of lower interest rates**.” [Cleveland – Summary of Economic Activity]  \n  • Real estate and construction contacts said firms “undertook more capital spending as they adapted to tariffs **and as short‑term interest rates declined**.” [Cleveland – Real Estate and Construction]\n\n- **Effect on commercial construction and real estate**  \n  • Lower short‑term rates **reduced borrowing costs for developers and builders**.  \n  • This was caused by cheaper financing making more projects financially viable.  \n  • As a result, contacts “saw a modest increase in demand over the last two months,” and some multinational manufacturers’ expansion of domestic capacity was “spurring new construction activity.” [Cleveland – Real Estate and Construction]\n\n- **Effect on financial services (loan demand)**  \n  • Lower rates **increased the attractiveness of borrowing** for some customers.  \n  • This was caused by the reduced cost of credit, which led firms and households to move ahead with projects or financing that had been marginal at higher rates.  \n  • As a result, “financial services contacts noted an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates,” indicating stronger activity in this interest‑sensitive sector. [Cleveland – Summary of Economic Activity]\n\n- **Offsetting softness in consumer‑facing properties**  \n  • Even with lower rates, some parts of commercial real estate weakened.  \n  • This softening was caused less by financing costs and more by demand fundamentals for travel, dining, and renting: “other commercial real estate contacts reported softening demand for consumer‑facing properties, including hotels, restaurants, and apartments.” [Cleveland – Real Estate and Construction]  \n  • As a result, **rate cuts boosted construction tied to business investment and capacity expansion**, but **did not prevent weakening demand** in more discretionary consumer‑facing segments.\n\nOverall, in Cleveland the causal chain is explicit: **lower interest rates → cheaper borrowing → more capital spending and stronger demand in commercial construction and financial services**, with mixed outcomes across property types.\n\n---\n\n2. Other districts: interest‑sensitive sectors moved, but links to rates are mostly implied, not documented\n\nAcross other districts, the provided excerpts describe activity in interest‑sensitive sectors (especially real estate and construction) but generally **do not explicitly attribute changes to lower interest rates**.\n\n- **Dallas District – commercial real estate**  \n  • Effect: “Commercial real estate activity improved,” with: steady but competitive apartment demand, improved office leasing and “more signs of stability,” and solid industrial and retail activity. [Dallas – Construction and Real Estate]  \n  • This was caused, according to the text, by sector‑specific demand and supply conditions (elevated apartment supply, stabilizing office demand), **not explicitly by lower rates**.  \n  • As a result, we can say interest‑sensitive sectors like CRE were doing better, but we cannot directly trace a documented causal link from lower interest rates in Dallas based on the excerpts given.\n\n- **Kansas City District – consumer credit quality**  \n  • Effect: “Bankers noted consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately.” [Kansas City – Summary]  \n  • This was caused by worsening consumer credit performance, not by rate cuts themselves. The text does not say lower rates raised or reduced loan demand.  \n  • As a result, in this district the primary observed change in an interest‑sensitive area (consumer loans) is **deteriorating quality**, not a rate‑driven increase in volume.\n\n- **Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Chicago, St. Louis**  \n  • The excerpts for Boston and Philadelphia focus on manufacturing and overall activity and **do not connect conditions in housing, autos, or CRE to lower rates**.  \n  • The San Francisco manufacturing excerpt cites tariffs and cost pressures as causes of investment caution (“higher tariff costs resulted in stricter criteria for moving ahead with investment opportunities”) rather than interest rates. [San Francisco – Manufacturing]  \n  • Chicago and St. Louis are mentioned in the sub‑answers as districts where loan demand or pipelines may have been affected by rates, but the **relevant district texts are not present** in the provided excerpts, so we cannot document those causal links here.\n\nAs a result, outside Cleveland, we mainly see **activity descriptions without an explicit rate link**: any inference that lower rates supported these sectors remains plausible but not directly evidenced in the chunks provided.\n\n---\n\n3. Cross‑district differences in how rate‑sensitive sectors responded\n\nPutting this together, lower interest rates **did not translate uniformly** into stronger activity across districts:\n\n- **Cleveland (Fourth District)**  \n  • Cause: Declining short‑term interest rates.  \n  • Effect:  \n    – Modest increase in **commercial construction and broader commercial real estate demand**.  \n    – Higher **financial services activity** as loan demand picked up.  \n    – Targeted construction tied to multinational manufacturers’ domestic expansion.  \n  • As a result, Cleveland stands out as the district where the Beige Book explicitly states that **lower interest rates boosted demand in interest‑sensitive sectors**.\n\n- **Dallas and other districts with real estate/commercial activity**  \n  • Cause: Sector‑specific demand, supply conditions, and broader economic factors.  \n  • Effect: Improved commercial real estate activity (Dallas) and various shifts in construction or manufacturing.  \n  • As a result, these sectors may have benefited from lower rates, but the provided texts do not say “because of lower interest rates,” so the **causal link to rate cuts is not documented** in these excerpts.\n\n- **Districts with weaker credit conditions or muted demand (e.g., Kansas City and others mentioned but not documented)**  \n  • In some districts, consumer lending portfolios deteriorated, or overall loan growth and consumer credit demand remained muted (e.g., the Sixth/Atlanta District as described in other Beige Book content, not in the supplied chunks).  \n  • This was caused by factors such as cautious borrowers, credit quality concerns, or weak underlying demand, which apparently **offset the usual stimulative effect** of lower borrowing costs.  \n  • As a result, even with lower interest rates, **interest‑sensitive sectors did not uniformly strengthen**, especially in consumer lending.\n\n---\n\n4. Overall causal pattern\n\nBased on the evidence provided:\n\n- **Where the Beige Book is explicit (Cleveland)**, the causal chain is clear: **lower interest rates → increased demand in commercial construction and financial services, and more capital spending**.  \n- **In other districts**, interest‑sensitive sectors like commercial real estate, construction, and consumer lending moved for a variety of reasons, but the excerpts mostly **do not explicitly attribute those movements to lower rates**, so the causal role of rate cuts there remains implied rather than documented.  \n- **Cross‑district variation** arose because local demand conditions, tariffs, sector‑specific pressures, and credit quality sometimes **amplified** and sometimes **muted** the effects of lower interest rates on housing, autos, commercial real estate, and financial services.\n",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements of the expected answer:\n1) Lower interest rates had positive effects across multiple sectors, especially:\n   - Cleveland: uptick in commercial construction and financial services demand due to lower rates.\n   - Chicago: modest loosening in financial conditions with business loan volumes increasing.\n2) Impact was mixed across housing:\n   - Residential real estate remained weak in Dallas.\n   - Home sales were flat in Boston.\n   - Housing response was more muted than commercial sectors.\n\nCheck against the system answer:\n- Cleveland: The system answer accurately captures that lower (short‑term) interest rates caused an uptick in demand in commercial construction and financial services, and ties this to cheaper borrowing and more capital spending. This matches and elaborates the ground truth.\n- Chicago: The expected answer explicitly notes modest loosening of financial conditions and increased business loan volumes. The system answer does NOT mention this at all; instead, it only alludes vaguely to Chicago in a meta way (“Chicago and St. Louis are mentioned… but the relevant district texts are not present”), and then says it cannot document those links. So a key fact from the ground truth is missing.\n- Dallas housing: Expected answer highlights that residential real estate remained weak despite lower rates. The system answer discusses Dallas commercial real estate (improved activity) but does not mention weak residential housing or characterize it as a muted response to lower rates. This key contrast is missing.\n- Boston home sales: Expected answer states home sales were flat in Boston, again as part of the muted housing response. The system answer says Boston excerpts focus on manufacturing and do not connect housing to rates, and gives no information about flat home sales. Another key fact is missing.\n- Overall characterization: Expected answer says that the housing market’s response to lower rates was more muted than commercial sectors. The system answer does say that impacts were uneven and that some consumer‑facing property segments softened even with lower rates, but it does not clearly make the specific cross‑district point about muted housing vs. commercial in Boston and Dallas.\n\nThere are no clear factual contradictions with the ground truth; instead, the answer is incomplete with respect to several key districts and the housing‑vs‑commercial comparison that the ground truth emphasizes. The Cleveland portion is correct and detailed, but Chicago, Dallas residential, and Boston housing are omitted or treated as undocumented.\n\nTherefore, the system answer is accurate where it speaks but misses multiple key facts, so it is partially correct rather than fully correct or incorrect.",

      "question": "How did federal funding changes affect employment in specific sectors?",
      "expected_answer": "Federal funding changes negatively impacted employment across multiple sectors: In Boston, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in education and health-care sectors. In Cleveland, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to federal grant uncertainty. In New York, nonprofits faced challenges from reduced federal benefit programs, with community health-care centers reporting financial strain. Manufacturing employment in Boston was mixed, with one firm shedding workers to offset tariff-related cost increases.",
      "system_answer": "Federal funding changes affected employment mainly in sectors that depend heavily on federal grants, and the Beige Book evidence ties these changes to concrete labor‑market outcomes in a few specific cases.\n\n1. **Boston District – education and health care**  \n   - **Cause:** “Cuts to federal grant funding” in the Boston Federal Reserve District.  \n   - **Effect:** This was **caused by** those grant cuts:  \n     > “Cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health-care sectors.” (BeigeBook_20251015, Boston > Labor Markets)  \n   - **Mechanism:** Because many education and health‑care providers rely on federal grants to fund staff positions (for example, student services, research staff, community clinics, or public‑health programs), the reduction in those grants lowered the revenues available to cover payroll. **As a result**, organizations in these sectors responded by laying off workers.  \n   - **Net district outcome:** The Boston section also reports that “employment was flat overall, as both hiring and layoffs increased modestly.” This means that, even though layoffs in education and health care rose **because of** federal grant cuts, hiring in other sectors partially offset those losses so that total district employment did not change much.\n\n2. **Cleveland District – nonprofit sector (hiring restraint)**  \n   - **Cause:** Decreased funding and uncertainty around federal grants reported by nonprofits.  \n   - **Effect:** This was **caused by** that funding decline and uncertainty: nonprofits “were not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants.” (BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Community Conditions)  \n   - **Mechanism:** Nonprofits often plan staffing around expected grant income. When federal funding was reduced or became uncertain, managers delayed or froze hiring to avoid taking on payroll commitments they might not be able to sustain. **As a result**, employment growth in the nonprofit sector slowed—not primarily through layoffs, but through leaving vacancies unfilled.\n\n3. **Sectors with employment changes *not* explicitly tied to federal funding**  \n   - In the **New York District**, the Beige Book notes that firms in “education and health care, retail, construction, and transportation … reported fairly significant declines” in employment (New York > Labor Markets). However, the text **does not** say these declines were caused by federal funding cuts or grant changes. Any such link would be speculative.  \n   - Earlier references suggesting that in **Philadelphia** “uncertainty over federal funding slowed planned nonresidential construction projects” are **not confirmed** in the excerpts provided; there is no Philadelphia text here to document that causal chain.  \n   - Similarly, prior mentions of community organizations in **New York or San Francisco** facing funding or grant cuts are **not supported** by the supplied passages.\n\n4. **What we cannot say from this evidence**  \n   - **No job counts or precise magnitudes:** The Beige Book excerpts do not quantify how many jobs were lost in Boston’s education and health‑care sectors or how many positions went unfilled in Cleveland’s nonprofits. As a result, we know the **direction** of the effect (layoffs or hiring freezes) but not the size.  \n   - **No program‑level breakdown:** The reports do not specify which federal grant programs (e.g., specific education, health, or social‑service grants) were cut, so we cannot link employment effects to individual programs.  \n   - **No multipliers or elasticities:** There are no estimates of how many jobs change per dollar of federal funding gained or lost.\n\n**Overall cause–effect summary:**  \n- **Cuts to federal grant funding in the Boston District → layoffs in education and health care**, contributing to flat overall employment as other sectors added some jobs.  \n- **Decreased and uncertain federal grants for nonprofits in the Cleveland District → nonprofits not filling open positions**, dampening employment growth through hiring restraint rather than explicit layoffs.  \n- Other observed sectoral employment declines (e.g., in parts of New York’s economy) are **not** directly linked to federal funding changes in the provided evidence, so their causes remain unspecified here.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) In Boston, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in education and health‑care sectors.\n2) In Cleveland, nonprofits were not filling open positions due to federal grant uncertainty.\n3) In New York, nonprofits faced challenges from reduced federal benefit programs, with community health‑care centers reporting financial strain.\n4) Manufacturing employment in Boston was mixed; one firm shed workers to offset tariff‑related cost increases.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer correctly captures (1): It explicitly states that cuts to federal grant funding in the Boston District led to layoffs in education and health care, and even quotes that language. No contradiction.\n- It correctly captures (2): It states that in Cleveland, nonprofits were not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants, and explains this as hiring restraint rather than layoffs. This matches the expected answer.\n- It does NOT mention (3) at all. Instead, it explicitly says that references to community organizations in New York facing funding or grant cuts are not supported by the supplied passages. That directly contradicts the expected answer, which asserts reduced federal benefit programs affecting New York nonprofits and community health‑care centers.\n- It also omits (4) entirely: there is no discussion of Boston manufacturing employment, tariff‑related cost increases, or a firm shedding workers to offset those costs.\n\nIn addition to omissions, the system answer makes a substantive, incorrect claim relative to the ground truth by saying that New York funding/grant‑related impacts are “not supported” in the evidence, whereas the expected answer indicates they are. Therefore the response is not just incomplete; it is also contradictory to the expected facts.\n\nGiven that: some key elements are correctly described (Boston education/health, Cleveland nonprofits), but other key elements are missing and there is at least one direct contradiction with the expected answer about New York, the correct classification is INCORRECT rather than partially correct.\n",

      "question": "What specific factors contributed to economic uncertainty across different districts?",
      "expected_answer": "Multiple factors contributed to uncertainty: Tariff policy changes made planning difficult for manufacturers (noted in Chicago and across districts). Federal grant uncertainty affected nonprofits (Cleveland, New York, Boston). Policy uncertainty was a top business concern (Dallas). Immigration policy changes created labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston). The potential for government shutdown was highlighted as a downside risk. Kansas City noted that despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic.",
      "system_answer": "Economic uncertainty across districts arose from a mix of broad macro/policy issues and very specific, local sector shocks. Below, the cause‑effect links are made explicit, by district or at the national level.\n\n---\n\n1. National‑level uncertainty and consumer behavior\n\n• Cause: Elevated economic uncertainty and rising prices\n  – Several district reports, summarized nationally, noted that households were facing **rising prices** amid **elevated economic uncertainty**.\n\n• Effect: More cautious, price‑sensitive consumers\n  – As a result, **lower‑ and middle‑income households** “continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty.” This uncertainty therefore **caused more cautious spending behavior**, particularly among non‑affluent consumers. [Source: National Summary > Overall Economic Activity]\n\n• Additional macro risk\n  – The National Summary also reported that **one District** highlighted “the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.” This perceived risk **caused added uncertainty about future economic growth**, though the specific district is not named. [Source: National Summary > Overall Economic Activity]\n\n---\n\n2. Policy, inflation, and interest‑rate uncertainty (multiple districts)\n\n• Dallas District – domestic policy and inflation\n  – Cause: **Domestic policy uncertainty** and **inflation** were cited by Dallas‑area contacts. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  – Effect: These factors **caused businesses to feel unsure about future costs and demand**, contributing directly to **economic uncertainty** in the district.\n\n• Philadelphia District – uncertain cost environment\n  – Cause: An **uncertain cost environment** made it difficult for firms to predict input expenses over the medium term. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  – Effect: This **caused firms to hesitate on long‑term investment decisions**, increasing economic uncertainty and slowing capital spending.\n\n• Cleveland District – inflation and labor market signals\n  – Cause: **Persistent inflation** and small upticks in **unemployment** were reported. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  – Effect: Persistent price pressures and a softening labor market **caused firms to question the durability of demand and margins**, contributing to a more uncertain economic outlook.\n\n• New York District – interest rates and tariffs (industrial real estate)\n  – Cause: **Uncertainty around interest rates** and **tariffs** affected expectations for financing costs and trade‑related activity. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  – Effect: This **caused hesitancy in industrial real estate activity**, as investors and users delayed or reconsidered projects in the face of unclear borrowing costs and trade conditions.\n\n• Boston District – tariffs, inflation, and outlook\n  – Cause: In Boston’s manufacturing sector, **tariffs, inflation, and general uncertainty** were noted as headwinds, and uncertainty “remained elevated,” complicating pricing, production, and advertising plans. [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Manufacturing and Related Services]\n  – Effect: This combination **caused firms to struggle with planning and to view the 2026 outlook as somewhat weaker**, reinforcing a more cautious stance on operations and investment.\n\n• Boston District – policy changes and household uncertainty\n  – Cause: Planned cuts to **SNAP and Medicaid**, alongside expectations of **further consumer‑price increases linked to tariffs**, heightened concern about household finances. [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Community Perspectives]\n  – Effect: These policy and price risks **caused increased anxiety and uncertainty about the economic situation of low‑ and moderate‑income households**, potentially dampening local consumption and community stability.\n\n---\n\n3. Trade policy, tariffs, and global demand\n\n• Cleveland District – manufacturing and trade policy\n  – Cause: Manufacturers in Cleveland reported **import tariffs** and **persistent uncertainty about trade policy**. [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Manufacturing]\n  – Effect: These trade‑policy concerns **caused flat or weaker orders**, particularly for firms tied to industrial and agricultural equipment; one contact reported orders about 25% below expectations. Weaker orders, in turn, **heightened uncertainty about future production, employment, and investment**.\n\n• Dallas and Cleveland Districts – trade policy and tariffs (sector‑specific impacts)\n  – Cause: \n    • In Dallas, **uncertainty about trade policy and import tariffs** weighed on **chemical exports**.  \n    • In Cleveland, the same factors weighed on **manufacturing demand**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  – Effect: This trade‑policy uncertainty **caused declines or weakness in export and manufacturing demand**, directly feeding into greater economic uncertainty for producers and their workers.\n\n• San Francisco District – agriculture and foreign demand\n  – Cause: In the Twelfth District, **trade policy adjustments and negotiations** led to weaker foreign demand, “particularly from China,” while **higher costs** combined with **low commodity prices**. [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries]\n  – Effect: Falling export demand and squeezed margins **caused financial strain on producers**. One contact noted that anticipated declines in sales volume would **limit investment for the following season**, illustrating how trade‑driven uncertainty translated into **reduced future capital spending**.\n\n---\n\n4. Commodity prices, weather, and input costs (especially Chicago agriculture)\n\n• Chicago District – yields, prices, and input costs\n  – Causes in agriculture:  \n    • **Weather and disease**: Dry conditions “assisted harvest but **hurt yields in some places**,” and “**crop disease trimmed yields a bit**.” Fruit and vegetable production was “**subpar for most products**.”  \n    • **Commodity price movements**: “**Soybean prices were lower, in part due to the absence of new‑crop exports to China. Corn prices were down despite strong export volumes.** Cattle and hog prices increased to record territory, while milk and egg prices declined.”  \n    • **Rising input costs**: “Concerns about higher input costs for 2026 intensified due to **rising fertilizer prices**.”  \n    • **Limited remaining cost‑cutting ability**: Farm operations had already cut costs, leaving “**limited flexibility left to further reduce expenses**.”  \n    [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Agriculture]\n\n  – Effects on uncertainty and investment:  \n    • These combined shocks **caused “elevated uncertainty” that unsettled agricultural operators**; net farm income prospects were unchanged, but risks around yields, prices, and costs made outcomes highly unpredictable.  \n    • As a result, “**lack of clarity on the economic outlook was putting a damper on capital investment, such as equipment purchases and repairs.**” In other words, uncertainty about future profitability **caused farmers to delay or scale back equipment purchases and repairs**, reducing agricultural capital spending in the district.\n\n• Chicago District – broader agricultural uncertainty\n  – Cause: The mix of volatile yields, subpar production, lower soybean and corn prices (partly due to weaker exports to China), record livestock prices, falling dairy/egg prices, and rising fertilizer costs for 2026 all reinforced questions about future margins and income stability.\n  – Effect: This environment **caused elevated uncertainty to persist in the agricultural sector**, influencing not only current spending but also expectations and planning for subsequent seasons.\n\n---\n\n5. Cost uncertainty and capital investment (Philadelphia and others)\n\n• Philadelphia District – investment decisions\n  – Cause: Firms in Philadelphia faced an **uncertain cost environment**, likely tied to unpredictable input prices and broader macro/policy factors. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  – Effect: This uncertainty **caused delays or reductions in long‑term investment decisions**, such as capacity expansion or major capital projects, as businesses waited for clearer signals on future costs.\n\n• Chicago and San Francisco Districts – agricultural investment pullbacks\n  – In Chicago, as noted, unclear economic prospects **caused agricultural operators to pull back on capital investment**, particularly in equipment and repairs. [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Agriculture]\n  – In San Francisco’s agriculture sector, expectations of lower future sales volumes **caused producers to plan reduced investment for the following season**. [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries]\n\n---\n\n6. Common vs. district‑specific uncertainty drivers\n\nAcross districts, some factors are broadly shared, while others are distinctly local. The cause‑effect patterns differ accordingly:\n\nCommon drivers (multi‑district):\n• **Inflation and rising costs**  \n  – Cause: Persistent or rising prices for goods, services, and inputs (including fertilizer and other farm inputs).  \n  – Effect: Caused firms and households in Dallas, Cleveland, Boston, Chicago, and nationally to worry about margins and purchasing power, leading to **more cautious spending and investment**.\n\n• **Policy and macro uncertainty (domestic policy, trade policy, interest rates)**  \n  – Cause: Unclear paths for domestic policy, tariffs, trade negotiations, and interest rates.  \n  – Effect: Caused **weaker investment and hiring plans**, hesitancy in industrial real estate (New York), weaker orders for manufacturers (Cleveland), constrained exports (Dallas, San Francisco), and an overall cautious outlook across several districts.\n\n• **Tariffs and trade policy**  \n  – Cause: Existing or potential tariffs and trade negotiations affecting costs and market access.  \n  – Effect: Caused **lower export demand** (San Francisco agriculture; Dallas chemicals), **weaker manufacturing orders** (Cleveland), and **higher expected consumer prices** (Boston), thereby raising uncertainty about both business revenues and household real incomes.\n\nDistrict‑specific or sector‑specific drivers:\n• **Chicago agriculture** – uniquely strong mix of yield volatility, subpar fruit/vegetable output, China‑related soybean export issues, and rising fertilizer costs for 2026, all of which **caused elevated uncertainty and dampened farm capital investment**. [Chicago > Agriculture]\n\n• **Boston community context** – planned SNAP and Medicaid cuts and tariff‑driven price increases **caused heightened anxiety and uncertainty specifically for low‑ and moderate‑income households** in New England. [Boston > Community Perspectives]\n\n• **Cleveland manufacturing** – import tariffs and trade‑policy uncertainty **caused particularly weak demand** for industrial and agricultural equipment, with some firms seeing orders 25% below expectations. [Cleveland > Manufacturing]\n\n• **San Francisco agriculture** – trade policy adjustments and negotiations that reduced Chinese demand, together with higher costs and low commodity prices, **caused financial strain** and plans to **limit next‑season investment**. [San Francisco > Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries]\n\n---\n\nOverall causal picture\n\nAcross the Federal Reserve districts, economic uncertainty was not driven by a single factor. Rather:\n• Policy ambiguity (domestic, trade, and fiscal), inflation, and interest‑rate uncertainty **caused firms and households to delay or scale back spending and investment**, especially when planning beyond the near term.\n• Trade policy changes and tariffs **caused weaker demand for exports and manufactured goods** and higher or more volatile prices, which in turn **caused producers to face revenue uncertainty and households to worry about real incomes**.\n• Sector‑specific shocks—such as Chicago’s weather‑ and disease‑related yield risks and rising farm input costs—**caused localized uncertainty**, particularly visible in agricultural investment plans.\n• These causes collectively **resulted in a more cautious, risk‑averse stance** from businesses and consumers across many districts, reinforcing a feedback loop of subdued investment, spending restraint, and continued economic uncertainty.\n",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements in the expected answer:\n1) Tariff policy changes made planning difficult for manufacturers (Chicago and across districts).\n2) Federal grant uncertainty affected nonprofits (Cleveland, New York, Boston).\n3) Policy uncertainty was a top business concern in Dallas.\n4) Immigration policy changes created labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston).\n5) Potential for government shutdown as a downside risk.\n6) Kansas City noted that despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic.\n\nCheck against system answer:\n1) Tariffs / trade policy and manufacturers: The system does discuss tariffs and trade policy uncertainty affecting manufacturers (e.g., Cleveland manufacturing; New York tariffs; Boston manufacturing; Dallas and Cleveland trade policy). It also notes tariffs creating planning difficulties, though it doesn’t explicitly tie tariffs to Chicago manufacturing as in the ground truth, but it does cover the core idea that tariff policy changes created uncertainty for manufacturers.\n2) Federal grant uncertainty affecting nonprofits: The system answer does not mention federal grants, nonprofits, or related uncertainty in Cleveland, New York, or Boston. This whole factor is missing.\n3) Policy uncertainty as a top concern in Dallas: The system explicitly states that in Dallas, domestic policy uncertainty and inflation were cited by contacts and links this to economic uncertainty, which aligns with the ground truth that policy uncertainty was a top business concern.\n4) Immigration policy changes and labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston): The system answer contains no mention of immigration policy, immigration-related labor issues, St. Louis, or Boston labor supply concerns. Entirely missing.\n5) Potential for government shutdown as downside risk: The system clearly states that one District highlighted “the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown,” matching this factor, albeit without naming the district, which is acceptable.\n6) Kansas City with current decline but optimistic 2026 expectations: The system answer does not mention Kansas City or this point about 2026 optimism.\n\nAdditionally, the system introduces many other factors (inflation, interest rates, commodity prices, weather, etc.) that are not in the expected answer. Those are not directly contradictory, but they go beyond what was asked. However, some of them may not be supported by the specific ground truth but the evaluation here is relative to the expected answer, not the broader document. The critical issue is completeness of the listed factors.\n\nNo explicit contradictions with the expected answer are present regarding the overlapping items: tariffs driving uncertainty, domestic/policy uncertainty in Dallas, and the government shutdown risk. But several key expected factors (federal grants & nonprofits, immigration policy & labor supply, Kansas City 2026 optimism) are absent.\n\nTherefore, the system answer is partially accurate but incomplete relative to the specified expected answer, with no clear factual errors about the overlapping points.\n",

      "question": "What supply chain disruptions affected manufacturing, and how did they impact production?",
      "expected_answer": "Supply chain challenges varied across districts. In San Francisco, manufacturers noted higher costs for utilities and imported semiconductor chips. In Chicago, manufacturing demand declined modestly with fabricated metals demand unchanged on balance as higher sales to some sectors were offset by lower sales to construction and automotive industries. Tariff-induced input cost increases affected manufacturing across many districts, with firms reporting difficulty planning due to changing tariff policies. Labor shortages due to immigration policy changes also constrained production in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Supply chain disruptions affected manufacturing mainly through higher costs, reduced availability of key inputs, and labor constraints, and these factors directly altered production levels, schedules, and investment decisions.\n\n1. Trade policy and tariffs → higher input costs and material shortages → lower or halted production\n- Disruptions were caused by trade-policy changes and tariffs that raised the cost of imported materials and equipment.\n  - This was caused by new or higher tariffs on inputs such as steel and semiconductor chips, and more uncertain international trade conditions. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- As a result, manufacturers faced:\n  - Elevated input prices and difficulty obtaining equipment and materials, particularly in New York. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - High steel prices severe enough that an upstate New York keg manufacturer **temporarily ceased production**. This was caused by steel becoming too expensive to profitably use. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Higher costs for imported semiconductor chips in the San Francisco district, which **raised production costs** and squeezed margins. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- As a result of these higher costs and shortages:\n  - At least one manufacturer in the San Francisco district **cut payroll and reduced output**, using workforce reductions to scale production down to what the constrained and more expensive inputs could support. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - An automotive contact reported that higher tariff costs made firms more cautious about **new investments**, which in turn constrained future production capacity and upgrades. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - In New York, uncertainty over tariffs and higher input prices **softened capital spending plans**, limiting expansion or modernization of production processes. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. Worsening supply availability and shrinking inventories → constrained production planning and output\n- Beyond tariffs, manufacturers experienced a general deterioration in supply availability.\n  - This was caused by tighter material flows and difficulty procuring needed inputs, even though delivery times did not lengthen dramatically. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- As a result:\n  - Inventories shrank in some regions, signaling that inputs were not being replenished as quickly as they were used. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - With thinner inventories and uncertain resupply, firms became more cautious in their **production planning**, often limiting or scaling back production runs to avoid stockouts and unfilled orders. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Reduced overseas demand, tied to shifting international trade dynamics and uncertainty, also fed back into production planning, causing some manufacturers to **moderate output** to match weaker and less predictable demand. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n3. Labor-related constraints → higher labor costs and lower effective capacity → delays and reduced output\n- Some supply-side disruptions took the form of labor shortages rather than physical material shortages.\n  - This was caused in part by immigration-policy changes and fears of deportation, which reduced the available labor pool in some manufacturing-intensive areas. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- As a result:\n  - Manufacturers reported **persistent labor shortages**, particularly in roles that relied on immigrant workers. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - These shortages **raised labor costs** as firms had to pay more to attract and retain workers.\n  - Higher labor costs and unfilled positions **contributed to production delays** and reduced effective production capacity, limiting how much output could be produced even when materials were available. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n4. Combined operational impacts on production levels, schedules, and processes\n- When these disruptions overlapped—higher input costs, tighter inventories, and labor constraints—they jointly reshaped manufacturing operations.\n  - In New York, tariff uncertainty and high steel prices directly **halted production** at a keg manufacturer, while more broadly, worsened supply availability and shrinking inventories **constrained output** and led firms to pull back on capital expenditures. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - On the West Coast, higher semiconductor and utility costs, together with weaker demand in some product lines, created **excess capacity**. This was caused by an inability to run plants economically at previous volumes.\n    - As a result, at least one Hawaii-based manufacturer **lowered production volumes and reduced payroll**, adjusting both the quantity of output and its production processes (e.g., workforce levels and investment criteria). [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nIn summary, trade- and tariff-driven cost increases, material availability problems, and labor shortages all acted as supply chain disruptions. These were caused by policy changes and shifting global trade conditions, and they resulted in higher costs, inventory tightening, labor constraints, and ultimately reduced or halted production, smaller production runs, delayed schedules, workforce cuts, and more cautious investment in manufacturing capacity.

      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key points in the expected answer:\n- Supply chain challenges varied by district.\n- San Francisco: higher costs for utilities and imported semiconductor chips.\n- Chicago: modest decline in manufacturing demand; fabricated metals flat overall due to sectoral offsets (higher sales to some sectors, lower to construction and automotive).\n- Across many districts: tariff-induced input cost increases affecting manufacturing, plus planning difficulty due to changing tariff policies.\n- Labor shortages due to immigration policy changes constraining production in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture.\n\nSystem answer:\n- Describes tariffs and trade policy raising input costs, specifically mentions higher costs for imported semiconductor chips in San Francisco and higher utilities implicitly via costs; also mentions planning/investment caution due to tariff uncertainty.\n- Describes labor shortages tied to immigration-policy changes, raising labor costs and reducing capacity, clearly mapping to the expected labor-constraint mechanism.\n- Describes higher input costs, shortages, shrinking inventories, and how these led to reduced/halted production, delayed schedules, reduced output, and cautious investment—these align with the general impact description in the ground truth.\n\nHowever:\n- The Chicago-specific content is missing: no mention of Chicago, modest decline in manufacturing demand, or fabricated metals being unchanged on balance due to offsetting sectoral patterns.\n- The system adds a number of specific details (New York keg manufacturer, Hawaii-based manufacturer, etc.) that are not in the expected answer but are not stated to be wrong; they are plausible elaborations, not contradictions.\n\nThus, the answer captures all of the *types* of disruptions and impacts from the ground truth (tariff-induced cost increases and uncertainty; semiconductor chip costs in San Francisco; labor shortages from immigration policy; constraint on production and planning) but omits the Chicago-district nuance. There are no direct factual contradictions relative to the expected answer. Therefore it is accurate but incomplete: partially correct rather than fully correct.\n",

In New York, rising business costs including insurance added to financial pressures for community service providers. Employer-sponsored health insurance expenses saw outsized increases, intensifying labor cost pressures across districts. These service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.",
      "system_answer": "Below is a side‑by‑side comparison of (1) which **service-related costs** drove input cost increases and (2) how those increases affected different **sectors**.\n\n---\n### 1. Main service-related cost drivers by sector\n\n**Banking**  \n- **Drivers:** Banks reported **elevated costs for technology and insurance** as key nonlabor inputs. [Cleveland > Prices]  \n- **Nature of costs:** Technology includes IT systems and software; insurance is cited generically (no breakdown by type). [National Summary > Prices; Cleveland > Prices]\n\n**Professional & Business Services**  \n- **Drivers:** Similar to banks, these firms **continued to report elevated costs for technology and insurance**. [Cleveland > Prices]  \n- **Additional context:** Nationally, higher costs for **technology solutions** are highlighted as a broad input-cost driver, and professional services are major users of such solutions. [National Summary > Prices]\n\n**Manufacturing**  \n- **Drivers (service-related):**  \n  - **Utilities:** Manufacturers in Cleveland specifically cited **rising utilities costs**. [Cleveland > Prices]  \n  - **Insurance/IT indirectly:** Nationally, higher costs for **insurance, health care, and technology solutions** are part of the general input-cost backdrop, but manufacturing references are more centered on goods and tariffs than on these services. [National Summary > Prices]\n- **Non-service but related pressures:** Tariff-related import costs on **raw materials, imported components, and chemical inputs** were major additional sources of cost pressure. [Cleveland > Prices; National Summary > Prices]\n\n**Retail**  \n- **Drivers (mainly non-service but relevant to pricing behavior):** Retailers in Cleveland cited **tariff-driven cost increases on vehicles, beef, coffee, and chocolate**. [Cleveland > Prices]  \n- **Service-cost backdrop:** Nationally, higher costs for services such as **insurance, health care, and technology solutions** contributed to faster input-cost growth for firms generally, which includes retailers, but the direct attributions for retail are more explicitly about tariffs and goods than about services. [National Summary > Prices]\n\n**Nonprofits / Social & Community Service Providers**  \n- **Drivers:**  \n  - Chicago: **Social service organizations** reported **increased operating costs such as insurance**. [Chicago > Community Conditions]  \n  - New York: **Community service providers** faced rising business costs **including insurance**. [New York > Community Perspectives]\n- **Nature of costs:** Insurance is referenced generically; the Beige Book does not specify liability vs. property vs. other lines.\n\n**Health-care Sector (as a user and provider of services)**  \n- **Cost side (economy-wide):** Nationally, **health care services** are explicitly named as a rising input cost: “higher cost of services such as **insurance, health care, and technology solutions**.” [National Summary > Prices]  \n- **Provider-side pressures:** A New York **community health-care center** reported financial strain driven by patients’ distress and funding issues; while not explicitly tied to its own insurance/health-care input bills, this highlights stress within the health-care service sector alongside generally rising health-care costs. [New York > Community Perspectives]\n\n**Software / IT Services Firms**  \n- **Drivers:** Evidence indicates that **software and IT services firms’ own costs were stable on average**, even as they charged somewhat higher prices in at least one district (e.g., “prices for IT services rose moderately” in Boston). [Boston > Prices]  \n- **Contrast:** These firms are **suppliers** of technology services; the cost pressure is being felt more by **users** of technology (e.g., banks, professional services) than by IT providers themselves. [National Summary > Prices; Cleveland > Prices]\n\n---\n### 2. How higher service-related input costs affected sectors (margins, pricing, behavior)\n\n**Banking vs. Professional & Business Services**  \n- **Banking:** Faced **elevated technology and insurance costs**, which raised nonlabor input costs. While the Beige Book does not detail exact pricing moves in banking, the pattern elsewhere suggests two broad responses: absorbing some costs (compressing margins) or gradually increasing service prices. [Cleveland > Prices; National Summary > Prices]  \n- **Professional & Business Services:** Similarly exposed to higher tech and insurance costs; as service-heavy sectors, these increases directly affect their operating margins. Again, the text does not specify exactly how much they raised fees, but they fall under the broader national pattern of firms seeing **faster input-cost growth from services**. [Cleveland > Prices; National Summary > Prices]\n\n**Manufacturing vs. Retail (service costs in a tariff-dominated environment)**  \n- **Manufacturing:**  \n  - **Impact channels:** Manufacturers had to contend with **tariff-driven increases in raw materials, imported components, and chemicals**, plus **higher utilities costs** in Cleveland. [Cleveland > Prices]  \n  - **Pricing behavior:**  \n    - Nationally, some manufacturers **fully passed higher import costs to customers**; others **kept selling prices largely unchanged** to preserve market share or due to price-sensitive clients. [National Summary > Prices]  \n    - In Cleveland, several manufacturers and wholesalers introduced **tariff-related surcharges**; some manufacturers **held prices steady despite increased costs** to try to gain market share. [Cleveland > Prices]  \n    - In Boston, manufacturers’ output prices rose **modestly**, with smaller manufacturers passing through a **larger share of tariff-induced cost increases**. [Boston > Prices]  \n  - **Role of service costs:** Utilities (a service input) added to cost pressure, but the dominant documented driver of manufacturers’ pricing behavior was tariffs/import costs, not insurance or health care per se.\n\n- **Retail:**  \n  - **Impact channels:** Cleveland retailers cited **tariff-driven cost increases** on specific goods—vehicles, beef, coffee, chocolate. [Cleveland > Prices]  \n  - **Pricing behavior:**  \n    - Nationally, retail trades were among the sectors where some firms **fully passed higher import costs along**, while others held prices to avoid losing customers. [National Summary > Prices]  \n    - In Cleveland, many retailers used **selective price increases** or discounts rather than blanket price hikes, reflecting strong demand sensitivity. [Cleveland > Prices]\n  - **Role of service costs:** While the national report flags higher insurance/health-care/tech costs as part of the overall input-cost environment, the explicit retail narrative is far more about **goods and tariffs** than about rising service inputs.\n\n**Nonprofits / Social & Community Services vs. For-profit Services**  \n- **Nonprofits / Community Providers (Chicago & New York):**  \n  - **Impact channels:**  \n    - Chicago: Social service organizations’ **increased insurance costs**, alongside reduced income/donations, forced them to **prioritize which services to offer**—effectively reducing service capacity rather than raising prices (since many services are free or subsidized). [Chicago > Community Conditions]  \n    - New York: Community service providers saw **rising business costs including insurance** amid uncertain funding, adding **financial pressures** rather than prompting clear price hikes. [New York > Community Perspectives]\n  - **Outcome vs. firms with pricing power:** Unlike profit-oriented manufacturers/retailers that can pass costs through (at least partly), these providers often **cannot freely raise prices**, so higher insurance and other service costs translate more directly into **budget strain and service cutbacks**.\n\n- **For-profit Service Providers (e.g., IT services, professional services):**  \n  - Boston reports **IT services prices rose moderately**, suggesting some pass-through of cost pressures (or demand-driven price increases) to clients. [Boston > Prices]  \n  - Professional and business services in Cleveland, facing higher technology and insurance costs, are likely to respond similarly with **gradual fee increases** where demand allows, although specific price moves are not detailed. [Cleveland > Prices]\n\n**Health-care Sector vs. Other Sectors**  \n- **Health care as a cost driver:**  \n  - Nationally, **health-care services** are grouped with insurance and technology as key contributors to faster input-cost growth. [National Summary > Prices]  \n  - This means health-care costs are raising the **compensation and benefits bills** of employers across sectors (even if not itemized by sector), squeezing margins similarly to insurance.\n\n- **Health-care providers:**  \n  - The New York community health-care center example highlights **financial strain from patient hardship and funding challenges**; though not tied in text to rising insurance/health-care input bills, it is consistent with a sector under pressure at the same time that health-care costs are nationally reported to be rising. [New York > Community Perspectives]\n\n**IT Providers vs. IT Users**  \n- **IT Providers (software/IT services firms):**  \n  - In Boston, **IT services prices rose moderately**, with **costs for IT firms themselves described as stable on average** (from the broader Beige Book context). [Boston > Prices]  \n  - Result: IT firms may enjoy **improved margins** or at least neutral margins, since they can raise prices without large documented jumps in their own input costs.\n\n- **IT Users (banks, professional services, other businesses):**  \n  - Banks and professional/business services in Cleveland face **elevated technology costs**, which are an input to their core services. [Cleveland > Prices]  \n  - Nationally, higher **technology-solution costs** contribute to widespread input-cost increases. [National Summary > Prices]  \n  - Result: These sectors are **net payers** of higher tech prices; their margins are squeezed unless they can pass costs on through higher fees or service prices.\n\n---\n### 3. Most vs. least affected by service-related input costs\n\n**Most Directly Affected by Service-related Inputs**  \n- **Banking (Cleveland):** High dependence on IT and insurance, both explicitly cited as elevated. [Cleveland > Prices]  \n- **Professional & Business Services (Cleveland):** Similarly exposed to higher tech and insurance costs; these are core overhead inputs. [Cleveland > Prices]  \n- **Nonprofits / Social & Community Services (Chicago, New York):** Particularly sensitive to **insurance** and other operating costs because they have limited pricing power and rely on constrained funding streams. [Chicago > Community Conditions; New York > Community Perspectives]\n\n**Moderately / Indirectly Affected**  \n- **Manufacturing:**  \n  - Materially affected by **tariff and import costs**, with **utilities** as an additional service-related pressure in Cleveland. [Cleveland > Prices; National Summary > Prices]  \n  - Service costs (insurance, health care, tech) are part of the general backdrop but less uniquely emphasized for manufacturers in the excerpts.\n\n- **Retail:**  \n  - Heavily affected by **tariff-driven goods costs** (vehicles, beef, coffee, chocolate in Cleveland) rather than explicitly by rising service inputs. [Cleveland > Prices; National Summary > Prices]\n\n**Least / Not Explicitly Reported as Bearing Higher Service Input Costs**  \n- **Software / IT Services Providers:**  \n  - Report **stable input costs on average**, even as they can charge **moderately higher prices** (e.g., Boston IT services). [Boston > Prices]  \n  - They are less burdened by rising service inputs and more likely to **benefit** from increased demand and pricing power.\n\n---\n### 4. Comparative impact on margins and pricing behavior\n\n- **Banking & Professional Services vs. IT Providers:**  \n  - Banks and professional services endure **higher technology and insurance bills**, pushing them either to raise fees cautiously or accept margin compression. [Cleveland > Prices; National Summary > Prices]  \n  - IT providers, with **stable costs and rising prices**, tend to see **stronger margins**, the mirror image of their clients’ experience. [Boston > Prices]\n\n- **Manufacturing & Retail vs. Service-heavy Nonprofits:**  \n  - Manufacturers and retailers can, at least partially, **pass through costs** (tariffs, utilities) via higher prices or surcharges, though sometimes they choose not to, trading margins for market share. [National Summary > Prices; Cleveland > Prices; Boston > Prices]  \n  - Social service organizations and community providers face **rising insurance and business costs** but have limited ability to charge more; their response is to **tighten budgets and cut or prioritize services**, not to raise prices. [Chicago > Community Conditions; New York > Community Perspectives]\n\nIn sum, the main service-related costs driving input cost increases are **insurance**, **health care**, **technology solutions/IT**, and **utilities**. These have the **sharpest documented impact** on sectors that (1) are heavy users of these services (banking, professional & business services, nonprofits/community providers) and (2) lack strong pricing power (especially nonprofits). Manufacturing and retail are more prominently affected by **tariffs and import costs**, with service inputs playing a secondary but still meaningful role, while IT providers themselves are comparatively insulated and sometimes benefit from the environment of rising technology prices. [National Summary > Prices; Boston > Prices; Cleveland > Prices; Chicago > Community Conditions; New York > Community Perspectives]",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Service-related costs that drove input cost increases were specifically: insurance, health care, and technology solutions.\n2) In New York, rising business costs including insurance added to financial pressures for community service providers.\n3) Employer-sponsored health insurance expenses saw outsized increases, intensifying labor cost pressures across districts.\n4) These service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer clearly identifies insurance, health care, and technology solutions as key service-related cost drivers several times, matching point (1).\n- It explicitly mentions New York community service providers facing rising business costs including insurance and resulting financial pressures, matching point (2).\n- It explains that health-care services and insurance costs raise employers’ compensation/benefits bills across sectors, which is consistent with “employer‑sponsored health insurance expenses saw outsized increases, intensifying labor cost pressures,” even if the exact wording “employer-sponsored”/“outsized” is not repeated. There is no contradiction and the meaning is preserved, satisfying point (3) in substance.\n- It repeatedly notes that these service-cost increases occur in an environment where tariff-driven goods-cost increases (on raw materials, imports, vehicles, beef, coffee, chocolate, etc.) are also important for manufacturing and retail, matching point (4).\n- On how this affected different sectors, the system gives a more detailed breakdown by sector (banking, professional services, manufacturing, retail, nonprofits/community providers, health care, IT providers vs IT users). All of this is consistent with the expected answer and elaborates it; there are no factual contradictions.\n- Extra details like utilities or IT providers’ own cost structures go beyond the expected answer but do not conflict with it.\n\nAll core elements from the expected answer are present and correctly represented, with additional accurate detail. Therefore the answer is correct rather than merely partial.",

      "question": "Which retail categories saw gains versus declines, and how does this reflect consumer behavior patterns?",
      "expected_answer": "In Chicago, leisure and hospitality sales were mixed. Categories seeing gains included restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments, as well as new light vehicle sales which were brisk due to strong underlying demand and the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases. Categories seeing softness included travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels. Used vehicle sales remained steady though dealerships in low-to-moderate income communities reported softer demand. This pattern reflects consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.",
      "system_answer": "Retail categories moved in two clear directions, and those shifts closely mirror underlying consumer behavior and financial pressures.\n\n1. Categories that saw gains – and what caused them\n\n• **Value/quick-service restaurants and family dining**  \n  - **Gains:** Fast food, fast casual, and family dining restaurant sales strengthened in several Districts, even as more traditional sit‑down restaurants weakened. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - **Caused by:** Consumers becoming more **price‑sensitive and value‑oriented**. As a result, they are eating out, but trading down from full‑service dining (with tips, drinks, and extras) to cheaper, quicker options. In Atlanta, diners explicitly cut extras like desserts and alcohol, showing an effort to manage total check size. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• **Home investment and renovation–related spending**  \n  - **Gains:** Appliances, computers, landscaping products, and replacement windows tied to home renovation all saw stronger demand in places like Chicago. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - **Caused by:** Consumers choosing to **improve existing homes rather than move**, likely due to high housing costs and mortgage rates. As a result, spending shifts toward renovation items (e.g., replacement windows, landscaping, appliances) and away from goods tied to new home construction and furniture for new homes, which declined in some Districts. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• **Apparel, cosmetics, fragrances, and select specialty retail**  \n  - **Gains:** Apparel, cosmetics, and fragrances, along with small higher‑end retailers, luxury goods, and athletic footwear, showed solid performance. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - **Caused by:** A mix of **“small treat” / discretionary splurge behavior** and continued spending power among higher‑income consumers. As a result, some personal-care and fashion categories hold up or grow even while larger big‑ticket items and broad goods categories soften.\n\n• **Used cars and selected auto segments**  \n  - **Gains:** Used car sales rose, and there was a shift in new vehicle demand away from SUVs and EVs toward family sedans and used vehicles in the Kansas City District. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - **Caused by:** Heightened **price sensitivity and deal‑seeking** in auto markets. As a result, consumers favor lower‑priced options (used vehicles, sedans) and move away from costlier SUVs and some new EVs, except where incentives apply.\n\n• **New electric vehicles (EVs) – temporarily**  \n  - **Gains:** There was a time‑limited surge in new EV sales in Atlanta ahead of an expiring tax credit. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - **Caused by:** Consumers **responding strongly to discounts and time‑bound incentives**. As a result, EV purchases were pulled forward into the incentive window, illustrating how sensitive big‑ticket demand is to policy and price breaks.\n\n• **Luxury restaurants, luxury travel, and higher‑end retailers**  \n  - **Gains:** Luxury and quick‑service restaurants, some luxury travel, and higher‑end or luxury retailers maintained or increased sales. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - **Caused by:** A **bifurcation by income**. Higher‑income households experience less budget pressure and therefore continue to spend on premium dining, luxury goods, and upscale travel. As a result, luxury and niche high‑end categories can grow even while mass‑market segments weaken.\n\n• **Health care, food and beverage retailers**  \n  - **Gains:** Health care retailers and food and beverage retailers showed solid performance. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - **Caused by:** These are more **essential, non‑discretionary** categories. As a result, spending holds up better than in optional or big‑ticket goods, even when consumers cut back elsewhere.\n\n2. Categories that saw declines – and what caused them\n\n• **Casual sit‑down restaurants**  \n  - **Declines:** Casual sit‑down restaurants weakened in several areas, even as fast food and quick‑service restaurants strengthened. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - **Caused by:** Consumers **trading down within dining** – opting for cheaper formats and trimming extras. As a result, mid‑priced, full‑service restaurants are squeezed from both sides: budget diners move to quick‑service, and affluent diners may shift to either luxury experiences or stay selective.\n\n• **Big-ticket and discretionary goods (furniture, building materials, sporting goods, consumer electronics)**  \n  - **Declines:**  \n    • Building materials, garden equipment, and furniture stores weakened in Dallas; similar softness in building‑materials‑adjacent categories elsewhere.  \n    • Consumer electronics (outside of specific gains like computers in Chicago) and sporting goods declined.  \n    • Companies tied to new home construction and at least one furniture store in Richmond reported lower sales. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - **Caused by:** Households **postponing or scaling back large or non‑essential purchases** under financial pressure. High interest rates and elevated prices make big‑ticket items easier to delay. As a result, categories that depend on new home moves or discretionary recreation (furniture, building materials, sporting goods, some electronics) weaken.\n\n• **Broad consumer goods and non‑auto retailers**  \n  - **Declines:**  \n    • Non‑auto retailers overall in Philadelphia reported weaker performance.  \n    • In San Francisco, broad consumer goods categories like food products, beverages, clothing, and pet supplies, as well as more affordable goods, all softened. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - **Caused by:** A combination of **overall spending restraint** and **intense price comparison**. Consumers are “looking for value” and comparative price shopping in Richmond, for example. As a result, everyday-goods retailers face demand erosion unless they compete aggressively on price or perceived value.\n\n• **Automotive and some auto dealers**  \n  - **Declines:** Automotive goods and sporting goods fell in Kansas City; auto dealers in Dallas and some other regions reported weaker overall sales. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - **Caused by:** Elevated vehicle prices and borrowing costs making cars feel less affordable. As a result, shoppers shift from new to used vehicles, from SUVs and EVs to cheaper sedans, and some postpone purchases entirely, weakening total auto dealer volumes.\n\n• **Travel-related retail and midrange hospitality**  \n  - **Declines:** Airlines and hotels were weaker in Chicago, and travel‑related retail spending softened in San Francisco. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - **Caused by:** Consumers **paring back discretionary travel** and focusing on value when they do travel. As a result, mainstream travel and related retail see slower growth or outright declines, even as some luxury travel segments remain supported by affluent customers.\n\n• **Non-luxury retail space demand (some urban markets)**  \n  - **Declines:** Non‑luxury retail space demand weakened in parts of New York City. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - **Caused by:** Softer performance of mass‑market retailers and shifts toward online or value‑oriented formats. As a result, landlords see reduced demand for mid-tier brick‑and‑mortar space, especially where costs are high.\n\n3. How these patterns reflect broader consumer behavior\n\nAcross all of these categories, several clear behavior patterns emerge:\n\n• **Heightened price sensitivity and trading down**  \n  - Consumers are actively **“looking for value” and comparative price shopping** (Richmond). [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - This was caused by rising cost pressures (inflation, higher interest rates) and squeezed household budgets.  \n  - As a result, we see:  \n    • Shifts from casual sit‑down restaurants to quick‑service/fast food.  \n    • Movement from SUVs and new EVs to used cars and family sedans.  \n    • Cutbacks on extras such as desserts and alcohol when dining out.  \n    • Strong response to deals, discounts, and incentives, such as the EV tax credit surge.\n\n• **Postponement of big-ticket and non-essential purchases**  \n  - Many big‑ticket or discretionary categories (furniture, building materials for new homes, sporting goods, some electronics) are underperforming.  \n  - This was caused by consumers choosing to **delay or scale back purchases that can be put off** when finances are tight.  \n  - As a result, retailers in these categories see slower sales, while more essential segments (food, health care retailers) and incremental “treat” purchases (cosmetics, apparel) fare relatively better.\n\n• **Home improvement over home turnover**  \n  - Spending is stronger on appliances, landscaping, and replacement windows than on goods tied to new home construction. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - This was caused by high housing and financing costs making moving less attractive.  \n  - As a result, consumers invest in improving their current homes instead of buying new ones, shifting retail gains toward renovation‑linked categories.\n\n• **Bifurcation by income level**  \n  - At the same time that lower- and middle‑income households are trading down and focusing on deals, **higher‑income consumers are still spending freely** on luxury goods, higher‑end retailers, luxury dining, and some luxury travel. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - This was caused by unequal financial strain: affluent households are less affected by price and rate increases.  \n  - As a result, the retail landscape shows **simultaneous strength at the high end and weakness in the mid‑market**, with budget/value formats also doing relatively well.\n\n• **Promotion- and incentive-driven behavior**  \n  - The EV surge ahead of a tax credit expiration is a clear example of time‑sensitive buying. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - This was caused by consumers seeking to maximize financial benefits and “beat” pending price increases or benefit expirations.  \n  - As a result, demand becomes **lumpier and more volatile**, spiking around promotions, discounts, and policy deadlines rather than growing steadily.\n\nTaken together, the pattern of gains (quick-service dining, used cars, home renovation goods, certain personal‑care and luxury segments) versus declines (casual sit‑down restaurants, big‑ticket goods, broad consumer goods, mid‑tier travel and auto) reflects a consumer base that is more cautious, more value‑driven, and increasingly split between budget‑constrained households trading down and higher‑income households sustaining premium spending.\n",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements of the expected answer:\n- Geographic focus: Chicago\n- Gains: (1) restaurants in fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments; (2) new light vehicle sales were brisk, driven by strong demand and the end of tax incentives for EVs.\n- Declines/softness: (1) travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels; (2) used vehicle sales steady overall but softer in low-to-moderate income communities.\n- Interpretation: reflects consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer is broad, multi‑District, and not focused on Chicago specifically. It does mention that fast food, fast casual, and family dining strengthened (aligned with gains in value/quick-service dining), but it does not clearly anchor this to Chicago.\n- It states that used car sales rose and that there was a shift from SUVs/EVs to sedans/used vehicles, which contradicts the expected answer that new light vehicle sales were brisk and used vehicle sales were steady (with some localized softness). That is a factual conflict relative to the ground truth.\n- It describes a surge in new EV sales in Atlanta before a tax credit expiration, whereas the expected answer says brisk new light vehicle sales in Chicago driven in part by the end of EV incentives. The EV‑tax‑credit narrative is similar in spirit but different in location and specifics, and the system’s framing of gains in EVs does not match the expected \"end of tax incentives\" dynamic tied to broader new light vehicle demand in Chicago.\n- It does correctly note declines in travel-related retail and midrange hospitality (airlines and hotels weaker in Chicago, travel-related retail softer in San Francisco), which partially overlaps the expected softness in airlines and hotels in Chicago.\n- The behavioral interpretation: the system answer emphasizes price sensitivity, trading down in dining, and cutting back on discretionary travel, which aligns conceptually with the expected \"consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.\" However, it adds a large number of other patterns (home improvement, luxury bifurcation, etc.) not present in the expected answer and which draw heavily from other Districts.\n\nBecause there are clear factual mismatches about auto category performance (used cars “rose” vs. used vehicle sales “remained steady with softer demand in low-to-moderate income communities”, and the emphasis on EV gains in Atlanta vs. the Chicago-focused story) and the answer is not constrained to the Chicago context, it is not just incomplete but also contradictory to the expected answer. Therefore the answer cannot be considered correct or merely partially correct; it is overall incorrect.\n",

      "system_answer": "Energy sector performance differed notably by Federal Reserve District, both in overall conditions and in the specific activities mentioned.\n\n**Overall direction of energy activity**\n- **Atlanta (Sixth District)** – Energy expanded: Energy activity “expanded moderately,” making it a relative bright spot compared with many other sectors in the District and compared with most other Districts’ energy conditions, which were flat or declining. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Minneapolis (Ninth District)** – Energy decreased: The Minneapolis report notes that “energy activity decreased,” indicating a clear downturn but without detailing which subsectors (oil, gas, renewables) were responsible. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Kansas City (Tenth District)** – Oil & gas fell modestly: “Oil and gas activity fell modestly,” with firms reporting declining revenues, profits, and capital expenditures, even though prices were still slightly above profitable levels. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Dallas (Eleventh District)** – Activity flat: “Drilling and well completion activity was flat,” and overall drilling and oil production were described as flat amid cost and price pressures. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **National context** – Generally down: At the aggregate U.S. level, activity in “agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts.” This places Atlanta’s moderate expansion as an exception against a broadly weaker national backdrop. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Specific activities and subsectors mentioned**\n- **Exploration, drilling, and rigs**\n  - **Kansas City (Tenth District)**: Oil and gas drilling activity is specifically tracked; “nearly two-thirds of contacts reported steady drilling activity, while others saw declines.” The “number of active oil and gas rigs rose in Colorado and Wyoming but decreased slightly in Oklahoma as natural gas spot prices fell.” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Dallas (Eleventh District)**: “Drilling and well completion activity was flat,” with “a lot of rigs stacked in yards waiting to become spare parts,” indicating underutilized capacity. Project delays were reported, not increased activity. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Minneapolis (Ninth District)**: Energy is only discussed in aggregate (“energy activity decreased”); there is no explicit mention of drilling, rigs, or exploration trends. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Atlanta (Sixth District)**: The report does not emphasize drilling and rigs; instead it highlights other energy subsectors (Gulf production, LNG, power, and low‑carbon projects). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Production (oil and gas) and exports**\n  - **Atlanta (Sixth District)**: Specific mention of “crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico” and “liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports,” both contributing to the District’s moderate expansion in energy. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Dallas (Eleventh District)**: “Oil production” is noted as flat alongside flat drilling and completion activity. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Kansas City (Tenth District)**: The focus is on oil and gas “activity” and rigs rather than explicit production volumes, but the modest fall in activity and reduced capex imply weaker upstream operations. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Minneapolis (Ninth District)**: No specific production or export activities are broken out; only the overall decrease is reported. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Power, utilities, and demand-side activity**\n  - **Atlanta (Sixth District)**: “Electricity demand” is explicitly mentioned as part of the energy narrative, consistent with broader strength in energy usage alongside Gulf crude and LNG. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis**: Utility or electricity-demand details are not explicitly highlighted in the excerpts; their energy discussions center more on upstream oil and gas. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Low‑carbon, renewables, and emerging projects**\n  - **Atlanta (Sixth District)**: The only District in this set with explicit low‑carbon details. It mentions “carbon capture and storage projects” and notes “slowing solar development projects,” showing a mixed picture within the broader moderate expansion. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Dallas (Eleventh District)**: Pipeline projects are referenced and pipeline firms are described as relatively optimistic, but there is no explicit mention of renewables or carbon capture in the cited material. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Kansas City (Tenth District) and Minneapolis (Ninth District)**: No specific renewable or carbon‑capture activities are described in the provided evidence; the focus remains on conventional oil and gas. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Cost pressures, breakevens, and investment**\n- **Kansas City (Tenth District)**\n  - Performance impact: Despite modestly falling activity, some firms “reported lower breakeven prices due to reduced regulatory compliance costs,” partially offsetting other headwinds. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Investment: “Capital expenditures in the sector also declined further, with many firms citing heightened uncertainty as a headwind for investment.” Revenues and profits were reported as declining. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Dallas (Eleventh District)**\n  - Costs: “Breakeven costs for wells were rising due to increases in input costs,” squeezing margins even though drilling and completion were flat. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Projects: “Several firms noted project delays due to low oil prices and an uncertain policy environment”; many rigs were stacked idle, indicating a cautious stance rather than expansion. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Minneapolis (Ninth District)**\n  - The text notes that energy activity decreased, but it does not tie this to specific exploration cuts, breakeven changes, or capex decisions; earlier speculative links to exploration declines driven by higher input costs are not supported by the cited evidence. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Atlanta (Sixth District)**\n  - The report characterizes energy as expanding moderately without detailing breakeven or capex dynamics; instead it emphasizes the diversity of activities (Gulf crude, LNG, electricity, carbon capture) and notes some headwinds for solar. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Side‑by‑side characterization**\n- **Direction of performance**: Atlanta’s energy sector expanded moderately; Minneapolis’s decreased; Kansas City’s oil & gas fell modestly; Dallas’s stayed flat. Nationally, energy was “generally down,” so Atlanta stands out positively, Minneapolis and Kansas City contribute to the national softness, and Dallas marks a stable but pressured middle ground. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Activity mix**: Atlanta shows the broadest activity mix (offshore crude, LNG, power demand, carbon capture, solar); Kansas City and Dallas are more concentrated in upstream oil and gas (drilling, rigs, production, pipelines); Minneapolis is only discussed in aggregate. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Operational details**: Kansas City highlights rig counts by state and falling capex; Dallas emphasizes flat operations, idle rigs, rising breakevens, and project delays; Atlanta emphasizes growing Gulf/LNG activity but slowing solar; Minneapolis offers no such granularity. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nTaken together, these Districts illustrate a national energy sector that is more often weak than strong, with one notable growth region (Atlanta), clear declines (Minneapolis and Kansas City), and one key oil region (Dallas) essentially on hold, facing rising costs and policy uncertainty rather than outright contraction.

      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements in the expected answer:\n1) Variation across districts: \n   - Atlanta (Sixth) energy grew moderately and was a positive outlier.\n   - Dallas (Eleventh) drilling and well completion activity was flat.\n   - Nationally, energy activity was generally down among reporting districts.\n   - Chicago District mentioned higher energy prices as part of nonlabor cost increases affecting manufacturers.\n2) Specific activities: drilling and well completion in Dallas, and mention of Chicago’s energy prices in the broader cost context.\n\nCheck against the system answer:\n- Atlanta: System answer correctly states that energy in the Atlanta District “expanded moderately” and characterizes it as a bright spot relative to other districts. This matches the ground truth.\n- Dallas: System answer states “Drilling and well completion activity was flat” and that overall oil production was flat. This matches and elaborates correctly on the ground truth.\n- Nationally: System answer explicitly notes that at the aggregate U.S. level, activity in “agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts.” This matches the expected characterization that energy activity was generally down nationally.\n- Chicago: The expected answer says that the Chicago District noted higher energy prices as part of nonlabor cost increases affecting manufacturers. The system answer does not mention Chicago or this point at all.\n\nAdditional content: The system adds detailed discussion of Minneapolis and Kansas City, various subsectors (rigs, LNG, solar, carbon capture), and cost/breakeven issues. These are not in the expected answer but are not contradictory or incorrect with respect to it.\n\nThus, all key points present in the ground truth (Atlanta outlier up, Dallas flat, national energy generally down) are correctly captured. The only omission is the Chicago reference to higher energy prices in manufacturers’ nonlabor costs. That’s a missing but not contradictory detail. So the answer is accurate but slightly incomplete relative to the expected answer.\n\nGiven criteria: some, but not all, key facts covered, no factual errors → PARTIALLY_CORRECT rather than fully CORRECT, because the Chicago detail is a distinct key fact in the expected answer and is absent in the system response.",

      "question": "How did banking conditions differ for consumer versus business lending across districts?",
      "expected_answer": "In Kansas City, while expectations for 2026 were optimistic, consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately, signaling stress among households. In Chicago, business loan demand decreased slightly on net with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity, while consumer loan demand increased slightly with a pickup in mortgage refinancing. In Dallas, loan demand grew overall. St. Louis reported banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions. Consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.",
      "system_answer": "Below is a district‑by‑district, side‑by‑side comparison of **consumer vs. business lending conditions**. Where the Beige Book text allows, I contrast direction of demand, credit quality, and terms for consumers versus businesses; where it doesn’t, I note the limitation.\n\n---\n## Atlanta (Sixth District)\n\n- **Consumer lending:**  \n  In Atlanta, “overall consumer lending contracted further, even with a small uptick in HELOC applications.” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Atlanta > Banking and Finance]\n- **Business lending:**  \n  “Loan growth in the Sixth District was flat since the previous report. Loan demand from both corporate borrowers and consumers was muted amid persistent economic uncertainty.” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Atlanta > Banking and Finance]\n- **Side‑by‑side comparison:**  \n  • Consumer: Demand was muted and **volumes actually declined overall**, despite a small rise in HELOC applications.  \n  • Business: Corporate loan demand was also **muted**, but overall district‑wide loan growth was flat rather than contracting.  \n  → Atlanta shows **broad weakness on both sides**, with consumer lending somewhat weaker (contracting) than business lending (flat).\n\n---\n## Philadelphia (Third District)\n\n- **Consumer lending:**  \n  “Consumer lending (excluding auto lending and credit cards) rose strongly, home equity lines increased moderately, auto loans rose modestly, and mortgages ticked up slightly. Credit card volumes decreased modestly, down from a slight increase during the same period one year ago.” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Philadelphia > Credit Conditions]\n- **Business lending:**  \n  “The moderate decline in lending was largely driven by a continued strong decline in commercial and industrial lending and a modest decline in commercial real estate loans.” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Philadelphia > Credit Conditions]\n- **Side‑by‑side comparison:**  \n  • Consumer: **Broad-based expansion**—non‑auto/non‑card consumer loans up strongly; HELOCs up moderately; auto loans up modestly; mortgages up slightly; only credit card volumes down modestly.  \n  • Business: **Broad-based contraction**—C&I lending fell strongly; CRE loans declined modestly, driving an overall moderate decline in total lending.  \n  → In Philadelphia, **consumer lending was clearly stronger than business lending**, moving up across most categories while business loans shrank.\n\n---\n## Chicago (Seventh District)\n\n- **Consumer lending:**  \n  “In the consumer sector, loan demand increased slightly, with a few contacts noting a pickup in mortgage refinancing. Loan quality remained flat and rates edged down, but terms tightened slightly.” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago > Banking and Finance]\n- **Business lending:**  \n  “Business loan demand decreased slightly on net, with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity. Business loan quality declined modestly, as multiple contacts noted weaknesses among suppliers in the auto industry. Business loan rates moved down, but terms tightened.” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago > Banking and Finance]\n- **Side‑by‑side comparison:**  \n  • Consumer: **Demand up slightly**, credit quality **flat**, rates down a bit, and terms **a bit tighter**.  \n  • Business: **Demand down slightly**, credit quality **deteriorated modestly** (especially among auto suppliers), rates also down but **terms tightened more** than on the consumer side.  \n  → In Chicago, **consumer lending conditions were somewhat stronger** than business lending: consumer demand rose while business demand fell, and business credit quality weakened.\n\n---\n## Cleveland (Fourth District)\n\n- **Consumer (household) lending:**  \n  Bankers reported that loan demand from **households** “increased moderately in recent weeks, as both households and businesses were encouraged by lower interest rates.” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Financial Services]\n- **Business lending:**  \n  The same report states that loan demand from **businesses** also “increased moderately,” with one commercial banker noting higher demand as clients gained clarity around tariff impacts. Delinquency rates were flat. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Financial Services]\n- **Side‑by‑side comparison:**  \n  • Consumer: **Moderate increase** in household loan demand, supported by lower interest rates; delinquencies flat.  \n  • Business: **Moderate increase** as well, helped by lower rates and tariff clarity; delinquencies also flat.  \n  → In Cleveland, **consumer and business lending moved in tandem**, both strengthening moderately with stable credit quality.\n\n---\n## Richmond (Fifth District)\n\n- **Consumer lending / quality:**  \n  “A few institutions observed a modest increase in loan delinquencies, mainly within their consumer loan portfolios, including mortgages and home equity loans.” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Richmond > Finance]\n- **Business lending:**  \n  “Financial institutions continued to report stable demand for most loan types, with some institutions noting a modest increase in demand within their commercial loan portfolio.” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Richmond > Finance]\n- **Side‑by‑side comparison:**  \n  • Consumer: Demand was generally **stable**, but **delinquencies rose modestly** in consumer portfolios, especially mortgages and HE loans—indicating some deterioration in household credit quality.  \n  • Business: Demand for commercial loans **inched up**, and there is no parallel note of worsening business delinquencies in the excerpt.  \n  → In Richmond, **business lending looked slightly healthier**: commercial demand was edging up, while consumer portfolios began to show modest credit‑quality strain.\n\n---\n## St. Louis (Eighth District)\n\n- **Consumer lending / quality:**  \n  “Contacts also noted that consumer delinquency rates have been steadily increasing over the past few months, and they expect this trend to continue. A banker reported an increase in the number of people going to credit counseling agencies after borrowing to maintain their level of spending.” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, St. Louis > Banking]\n- **Business lending:**  \n  “Banking activity has remained unchanged since our previous report, with moderate loan demand and overall credit conditions remaining strong. A Memphis banker reported low levels of past-due loans and strong commercial loan demand and a bullish mindset due to falling interest rates. Another banker reported that, while small business demand for credit was depressed, the pipeline was building back up.” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, St. Louis > Banking]\n- **Side‑by‑side comparison:**  \n  • Consumer: **Rising delinquencies** and more borrowers turning to credit counseling, suggesting mounting household financial stress; standards were being tightened in response.  \n  • Business: **Moderate overall loan demand** with “strong” commercial demand in some areas (e.g., Memphis) and low past‑due rates; small‑business demand was depressed but improving.  \n  → In St. Louis, **commercial/business lending appeared comparatively stronger and healthier**, while **consumer credit quality was deteriorating**.\n\n---\n## New York (Second District)\n\n- **Business lending:**  \n  Previously cited Beige Book language (not fully reproduced in the new chunks) indicates that **overall loan demand at smaller banks declined primarily because of weaker business loan demand**, with tighter credit standards and slightly worse business‑loan delinquencies. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Banking (earlier evidence)]\n- **Consumer lending:**  \n  Demand for consumer loans at small and medium‑sized banks was reported to have **held steady** in earlier evidence, but the new excerpts do not restate this or provide fresh consumer detail. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Banking (earlier evidence)]\n- **Side‑by‑side comparison (within evidence limits):**  \n  • Consumer: Previously described as **roughly steady** in demand; current chunks do not add more detail.  \n  • Business: **Weaker demand**, tighter standards, and slightly worse delinquencies at small banks.  \n  → Based on the available Beige Book references, **business lending in New York was softer than consumer lending**, but this contrast relies on earlier text not fully reproduced in the new material.\n\n---\n## Kansas City (Tenth District)\n\n- **Consumer lending / quality:**  \n  “Bankers noted consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately,” pointing to rising risk in household credit performance. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Kansas City > Summary of Economic Activity]\n- **Business lending:**  \n  A prior Beige Book summary (not in the new chunks) reported **little to no change in loan demand or credit standards across categories**, implying stability in business loan conditions. The new text does not provide explicit business‑loan detail. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Kansas City > Financial Services (earlier evidence)]\n- **Side‑by‑side comparison:**  \n  • Consumer: **Moderate deterioration** in consumer loan portfolios (worsening performance/quality).  \n  • Business: Conditions described as **broadly stable** with little change in demand or standards.  \n  → In Kansas City, the available evidence suggests **consumer lending performance was weakening**, while business lending conditions were relatively unchanged.\n\n---\n## Dallas (Eleventh District)\n\n- **Consumer lending:**  \n  The new Dallas excerpts focus on **construction and real estate** (e.g., improved commercial real estate activity, steady apartment demand) and do **not** break out consumer loan volumes or conditions. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Dallas > Construction and Real Estate]\n- **Business lending:**  \n  Earlier Beige Book evidence (outside the new chunks) indicated that **overall loan demand rose modestly** in the Eleventh District, but the provided text does not distinguish business from consumer lending, nor does it detail commercial & industrial vs CRE lending. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Dallas > Banking (earlier evidence)]\n- **Side‑by‑side comparison (evidence limits):**  \n  • Consumer: No explicit consumer‑lending detail in the supplied text.  \n  • Business: Real‑estate‑related activity improved, but that’s not cleanly mapped to loan demand; prior summary noted modestly higher overall loan demand.  \n  → We **cannot reliably contrast** consumer vs business lending in Dallas from the current excerpts.\n\n---\n## San Francisco (Twelfth District)\n\n- **Consumer & business lending:**  \n  The “Financial Institutions” section in the excerpt only points to an external webpage: “For more information about District economic conditions visit: https://www.frbsf.org/…” and provides **no in‑text breakdown** of consumer or business lending. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, San Francisco > Financial Institutions]\n- **Side‑by‑side comparison:**  \n  • Consumer: Not described in the provided text.  \n  • Business: Not described either.  \n  → With the current evidence, **no consumer‑vs‑business lending comparison is possible** for San Francisco.\n\n---\n## Boston (First District)\n\n- **Consumer & business lending:**  \n  The Boston excerpt provided covers **manufacturing and related services** (sales, capex, outlook) and **does not address banking or credit conditions**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Boston > Manufacturing and Related Services]\n- **Side‑by‑side comparison:**  \n  • Consumer: Not discussed.  \n  • Business: Not discussed in lending terms.  \n  → No comparison can be made for Boston from the supplied text.\n\n---\n## Cross‑District Themes\n\n- **Districts where consumer lending was stronger than business lending:**  \n  • **Philadelphia:** Consumer categories mostly rising while C&I and CRE fell. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Philadelphia > Credit Conditions]  \n  • **Chicago:** Consumer demand up slightly with flat quality; business demand down slightly with modest quality deterioration. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago > Banking and Finance]  \n  • **New York (based on earlier text):** Business loan demand weaker and delinquencies slightly worse, while consumer demand held steady. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Banking (earlier evidence)]\n\n- **Districts where business lending looked stronger or more stable than consumer lending:**  \n  • **Atlanta:** Both sides muted, but **consumer lending actually contracted** while overall loan growth (driven partly by business) was flat. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Atlanta > Banking and Finance]  \n  • **Richmond:** Commercial demand modestly higher while consumer delinquencies rose modestly. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Richmond > Finance]  \n  • **St. Louis:** Strong commercial demand and low past‑dues in some markets vs. steadily rising consumer delinquencies. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, St. Louis > Banking]  \n  • **Kansas City:** Business conditions broadly stable vs. moderate deterioration in consumer loan portfolios. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Kansas City > Summary of Economic Activity]\n\n- **District where both moved together:**  \n  • **Cleveland:** Both household and business loan demand increased moderately with flat delinquencies. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Financial Services]\n\nOverall, the Beige Book shows a **mixed landscape**: in some districts (Philadelphia, Chicago, New York) business lending was weaker than consumer; in others (Atlanta, Richmond, St. Louis, Kansas City) consumer portfolios or volumes looked weaker than business lending; and in Cleveland both segments strengthened in parallel. For several districts (Boston, San Francisco, Dallas in detail), the provided excerpts do not allow a clean consumer‑versus‑business comparison.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The question and expected answer are narrowly focused: they only want how banking conditions differed for consumer vs business lending **in specific districts mentioned in the ground truth**—Kansas City, Chicago, Dallas, and St. Louis—and at a fairly high level. The expected answer:\n- Kansas City: optimistic 2026 expectations; consumer portfolios deteriorated moderately (household stress); business lending relatively stable.\n- Chicago: business loan demand decreased slightly, consumer loan demand increased slightly with more mortgage refis.\n- Dallas: overall loan demand grew.\n- St. Louis: banking activity unchanged, overall credit conditions strong; consumer stress signs; business conditions mixed.\n- Then a short synthesis: consumer showing some stress, business mixed.\n\nThe system answer:\n- Gives an extensive, district‑by‑district breakdown for many districts (Atlanta, Philadelphia, Chicago, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, New York, Kansas City, Dallas, San Francisco, Boston) and then cross‑district themes.\n- For **Chicago**, it accurately captures the key facts: consumer demand up slightly, with some mortgage refinancing; business demand down slightly, with some quality deterioration. That matches the expected answer.\n- For **St. Louis**, it states rising consumer delinquencies and strong overall banking conditions with moderate loan demand and strong commercial demand in some markets, small‑business demand depressed but improving. That aligns with the expected: banking unchanged with strong overall credit conditions; consumer stress; business lending mixed/relatively stronger.\n- For **Kansas City**, it correctly notes “consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately” and that business conditions were broadly stable. This matches the expected contrast of household stress vs more stable business lending. It doesn’t mention 2026 optimism explicitly but does not contradict it; omission of that nuance is acceptable.\n- For **Dallas**, it explicitly says the current excerpts don’t allow a reliable consumer‑vs‑business contrast and notes earlier evidence that overall loan demand rose modestly. The expected answer only says “loan demand grew overall” and does not insist on a detailed consumer vs business contrast. The system’s cautious partial statement is not incorrect.\n\nThere are no factual contradictions relative to the ground truth on these districts. The system adds a lot of extra districts and detail, but additional accurate context is allowed. Where the system lacks evidence (Dallas, San Francisco, Boston), it refrains from fabricating and flags the limitation.\n\nAll key points required by the expected answer regarding the specified districts (consumer deterioration/household stress in Kansas City and St. Louis vs more stable/stronger business; in Chicago, consumer demand slightly up vs business slightly down; Dallas overall demand up, though consumer‑vs‑business split not clear) are either explicitly present or at least consistent with what the system says. No wrong facts or contradictions are apparent.\n\nTherefore the answer qualifies as fully correct rather than merely partial, despite being more verbose and including other districts not asked about.",

      "question": "How did price pressures differ between manufacturing and services sectors?",
      "expected_answer": "In Dallas, price pressures were subdued in services but remained elevated in the manufacturing sector. In Richmond, price growth remained moderate overall despite some pickup in price growth in the manufacturing sector. In Chicago, producer prices grew moderately with contacts reporting moderate nonlabor cost increases including energy and raw materials. Manufacturing contacts attributed some raw materials price increases to tariffs, suggesting tariffs disproportionately affected goods-producing sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Price pressures differed in several important ways between manufacturing and services, both in current conditions and in expectations. Below is a side‑by‑side comparison organized by key dimensions.\n\n---\n**1. Input‑cost pressures (current)**\n\n- **Manufacturing**  \n  - Input costs were frequently described as **strong** or **robust** and were heavily influenced by **tariffs** and raw‑materials prices.  \n  - Kansas City: “**Input prices grew at a strong pace among manufacturing firms** but more moderately for services.” [Kansas City > Prices]  \n  - Cleveland: “**Nonlabor input costs rose at a robust pace**…Tariffs were frequently cited…**Many manufacturers reported tariff‑related cost increases on raw materials, imported components, and chemical inputs**,” plus higher **utilities** costs. [Cleveland > Prices]  \n  - Chicago: Manufacturers saw higher costs for **energy and raw materials like aluminum, copper, and steel**, with “**manufacturing contacts attributing the increases in metals prices to tariffs.**” [Chicago > Prices]  \n  - New York: Manufacturers faced **elevated input prices** and even production disruptions (e.g., a keg maker temporarily ceasing production due to **high steel prices**). [New York > Manufacturing and Distribution]\n\n- **Services**  \n  - Input‑cost pressures were generally **more moderate**, and more concentrated in specific purchased services rather than broad commodity inputs.  \n  - Kansas City: “Input prices grew at a strong pace among manufacturing firms **but more moderately for services.**” [Kansas City > Prices]  \n  - Nationally, several districts cited higher costs for **insurance, health care, and technology solutions** as key service‑sector inputs. [National Summary > Prices]  \n  - Cleveland: **Banking and professional and business services** contacts reported elevated costs for **technology and insurance**. [Cleveland > Prices]  \n  - Dallas: A professional and business services firm said **health‑care and business‑insurance premiums were rising faster than revenues**. [Dallas > Prices]  \n  - Philadelphia: Contacts cited cost pressures from **tariffs, insurance, health care, and utilities**, including a **15% rise in liability insurance** and nearly **10% in health‑care costs** over a year. [Philadelphia > Prices]\n\n**Contrast:** Manufacturing faced **broad, tariff‑driven and energy‑related cost shocks** at a strong/robust pace, whereas services generally saw **subdued‑to‑moderate overall cost growth** focused on **insurance, health care, and technology** rather than metals and other raw materials.\n\n---\n**2. Output (selling) prices to date**\n\n- **Manufacturing**  \n  - Despite strong cost pressures, realized **selling‑price increases were mostly modest or moderate**.  \n  - Cleveland: “**Selling prices rose modestly in recent weeks,** maintaining the pace seen since early 2025,” and **some manufacturers held prices steady despite increased costs** to gain market share—evidence of **incomplete pass‑through**. [Cleveland > Prices]  \n  - New York: “**Selling prices continued to rise moderately while input prices again rose strongly.**” [New York > Prices]  \n  - Richmond: Survey data showed manufacturers saw **“a slight increase in prices received,”** even as tariffs added to costs. [Richmond > Prices]\n\n- **Services**  \n  - Current selling prices in many service industries were **flatter or more subdued** than in manufacturing.  \n  - Richmond: “**Service sector firms reported virtually no change in price growth while manufacturers saw a slight increase in prices received.**” [Richmond > Prices]  \n  - National and district narratives generally describe **moderate** overall price increases, with no broad report of sharp service‑price acceleration in the latest period. [National Summary > Prices; Philadelphia > Highlights]\n\n**Contrast:** In several districts, manufacturers were **already nudging prices up** (though only modestly), while **service‑sector price growth was flat or merely moderate**, especially in Richmond where services showed **virtually no change** in prices received.\n\n---\n**3. Degree of pass‑through from costs to prices**\n\n- **Manufacturing**  \n  - Evidence indicates **partial or delayed pass‑through** of higher input costs.  \n  - Cleveland: Some manufacturers **kept selling prices unchanged despite higher input costs** to protect or expand market share. [Cleveland > Prices]  \n  - National Summary: In some cases, firms in **manufacturing and retail trades fully passed higher import costs along**, but this was not universal. [National Summary > Prices]\n\n- **Services**  \n  - Richmond: Both sectors cited tariffs adding to input costs, **“some of which have yet to be passed along to customers.”** [Richmond > Prices]  \n  - For services more broadly, the combination of **rising insurance/health‑care/technology costs** and **little change in prices received** (e.g., in Richmond) suggests **limited pass‑through so far**.\n\n**Contrast:** Both sectors showed **incomplete pass‑through**, but manufacturing more often reported **modest increases in prices received** despite strong costs, while many service firms—especially in Richmond—reported **almost no change in prices** even as specific input costs rose.\n\n---\n**4. Forward‑looking price expectations**\n\n- **Manufacturing**  \n  - Kansas City: Manufacturers expected a **clear acceleration** in selling prices following the strong run‑up in input costs:  \n    - “Firms **expect selling price growth to accelerate to a strong pace over the next couple of quarters**,” and  \n    - “**Most firms reported they anticipate raising selling prices in 2026 at a slightly faster rate than this year.**” [Kansas City > Prices]  \n  - Philadelphia (manufacturing indexes): “**The indexes for future prices paid and future prices received for manufacturers were well above their historical averages in September.**” [Philadelphia > Prices]  \n    - This implies manufacturers broadly foresee **firmer‑than‑normal price increases ahead**, even if current price hikes have been moderate.\n\n- **Services**  \n  - Kansas City: “**Anticipated price growth among services was slightly softer, though still expected to be at a moderate pace in coming months.**” [Kansas City > Prices]  \n  - Dallas: “**Service firms expect selling price increases to accelerate over the next 12 months, while manufacturing executives expect price growth to remain steady.**” [Dallas > Prices]  \n    - Here, the pattern is reversed: **services** expect more acceleration than **manufacturing** within that district.\n\n**Contrast:** \n- In **Kansas City**, manufacturing firms foresee **stronger and faster** price growth than services over the next few quarters and into 2026.  \n- In **Dallas**, service firms expect **more acceleration** in prices over the next 12 months than manufacturers, who anticipate **steady** price growth.  \n- Philadelphia’s manufacturing survey shows **elevated future price expectations**, but comparable forward‑looking detail for services there is not documented in the excerpts.\n\n---\n**5. Nature and sources of price pressures**\n\n- **Manufacturing**  \n  - Heavily exposed to **global trade and commodity markets**:  \n    - Tariffs on **steel, aluminum, copper**, raw materials, imported components, and chemicals. [Cleveland > Prices; Chicago > Prices; New York > Manufacturing and Distribution; National Summary > Prices]  \n    - Rising **energy and utilities** costs. [Cleveland > Prices; Chicago > Prices]  \n  - Boston manufacturers reported headwinds from “**tariffs, inflation, and uncertainty**,” underscoring sensitivity to macro and policy shocks. [Boston > Manufacturing and Related Services]\n\n- **Services**  \n  - More affected by **domestic cost categories**:  \n    - Higher prices for **insurance, health care, and technology solutions**. [National Summary > Prices; Cleveland > Prices; Philadelphia > Prices; Dallas > Prices]  \n    - Rising **employer‑sponsored health‑insurance expenses** added to labor‑cost pressures, especially for service firms with large workforces. [National Summary > Labor Markets]\n\n**Contrast:** Manufacturing inflation was driven primarily by **tariff‑related and commodity/energy shocks**, while services inflation was driven by **rising costs of purchased services and benefits** (insurance, health care, technology), with less direct exposure to metals and other raw materials.\n\n---\n**Overall comparison**\n\n- **Current period:**  \n  - Manufacturing endured **stronger, more broad‑based input‑cost pressures** than services and showed **modest but positive** increases in selling prices.  \n  - Services experienced **subdued‑to‑moderate overall price pressures**, with some districts (notably **Richmond**) reporting **virtually no change** in service‑sector prices despite notable increases in specific input costs.\n\n- **Looking ahead:**  \n  - In districts like **Kansas City** and via **Philadelphia’s** manufacturing indexes, manufacturers are positioned for **stronger future price growth**, building on robust input‑cost increases.  \n  - In **Dallas**, by contrast, **service firms** expect **more acceleration** in selling prices over the next year than manufacturing firms do, indicating that **future price pressures may gradually shift toward services** in some regions.\n\nIn sum, the Beige Book evidence shows that, during the latest reporting period, **manufacturing faced more intense and immediately visible cost pressures**—especially from tariffs and raw materials—while **services had milder overall price increases but rising costs in insurance, health care, and technology**. The relative balance of future pressures varies by district: some point to **stronger upcoming manufacturing price growth**, while others suggest **service‑sector prices may accelerate more** over the coming year.\n",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Dallas: price pressures subdued in services but remained elevated in manufacturing.\n2) Richmond: price growth remained moderate overall, with some pickup in manufacturing price growth; service-sector price growth showed virtually no change.\n3) Chicago: producer prices grew moderately, with moderate nonlabor cost increases (energy and raw materials), and manufacturing contacts attributed some raw materials price increases to tariffs, which disproportionately affected goods-producing sectors.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer covers many districts (Kansas City, Cleveland, New York, etc.) and offers a broad comparison of manufacturing vs. services, but it never explicitly states the Dallas detail that “price pressures were subdued in services but remained elevated in the manufacturing sector.” It references Dallas only for a single example of a professional and business services firm facing rising insurance and health-care premiums, and later for expectations: “service firms expect selling price increases to accelerate…while manufacturing executives expect price growth to remain steady.” This is not the same as the ground truth statement about current subdued service price pressures vs elevated manufacturing pressures; in fact, it suggests something different about relative future pressures.\n- The Richmond point that “service sector firms reported virtually no change in price growth while manufacturers saw a slight increase” is captured fairly well. The system explicitly cites Richmond for that contrast (services virtually no change; manufacturing slight increase).\n- The Chicago point is partially covered: the system states “Chicago: Manufacturers saw higher costs for energy and raw materials like aluminum, copper, and steel, with ‘manufacturing contacts attributing the increases in metals prices to tariffs.’” That matches the tariff/metal/raw-materials story. However, it never clearly states that overall producer prices in Chicago “grew moderately” or that nonlabor cost increases were “moderate,” though it does characterize them as higher costs; this is a nuance but not a direct contradiction.\n- The expected answer’s overarching conclusion that tariffs disproportionately affected goods-producing sectors is present: the system notes that manufacturers are heavily exposed to tariffs on metals and raw materials and contrasts this with more domestic cost drivers in services.\n\nErrors/contradictions:\n- While the system is generally accurate and grounded, it introduces substantial additional material (Kansas City, Philadelphia, national summary, etc.) not required by the expected answer. That is acceptable as long as it is correct, which it appears to be.\n- However, it fails to articulate the specific Dallas characterization from the ground truth (subdued service price pressures vs elevated manufacturing). Instead, it gives a different Dallas detail focused on expectations where services expect more future acceleration than manufacturing. This omission makes the answer incomplete relative to the asked question/ground truth, but it does not clearly contradict the ground truth because it’s about expectations, not current conditions.\n\nGiven this, the system answer captures some key themes (manufacturing more tariff/raw-material driven, services more subdued and insurance/health-care driven; Richmond’s almost no change in services vs slight manufacturing increase; tariffs hitting goods more). But it misses the explicit Dallas comparison and only partially reflects the Chicago “moderate” characterization. There are no clear factual contradictions with the ground truth, just incompleteness relative to the specific districts the question/expected answer emphasize.\n\nTherefore the answer is incomplete but not misleading: it should be rated PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

      "expected_answer": "Employers showed cautious hiring behavior: More employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. Those still hiring favored temporary and part-time workers over full-time employment. In Boston, both hiring and layoffs increased modestly, indicating churn rather than net growth. Employment in IT services increased modestly with hiring in sales and technical positions - a relative bright spot. Jobseekers in Cleveland reported offers were more likely to be part-time with little or no benefits. This pattern indicates employer uncertainty and reluctance to commit to permanent workforce expansion.",
      "system_answer": "Hiring patterns have moved from active expansion to cautious maintenance, and this shift indicates a drop in employer confidence.\n\nCause → Effect chain:\n\n1. **Rising uncertainty about future demand, costs, and AI’s impact on labor needs**  \n   - Employers are unsure how strong future sales will be, how input and wage costs will evolve, and how much AI and automation will change their staffing needs. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - **This was caused by**: volatile economic conditions, cost pressures, and rapid technological change that make long‑term planning harder.\n\n   **As a result…**\n\n2. **Hiring shifted from expansion to maintenance**  \n   - Many firms moved away from adding net new positions and are now hiring mainly to replace people who leave (turnover), keeping overall headcount flat. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - Instead of broad hiring sprees, they are trimming staff gradually through attrition, targeted layoffs, or reduced hours. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n   **This was caused by** the desire to limit long‑term commitments (like permanent hires) until the outlook is clearer.\n\n3. **More cautious and selective hiring behavior**  \n   - Employers report a “hiring chill”: open roles are filled more slowly, criteria are tighter, and marginal positions may be left unfilled. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - Some firms are delaying hiring even when they have budget approved and unspent. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n   **This was caused by** managers trying to protect margins and avoid the cost and disruption of over‑hiring if conditions worsen.\n\n4. **Increased use of temporary and temp‑to‑hire workers**  \n   - Firms are substituting temp and temp‑to‑hire arrangements for direct, permanent hires. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n   **This was caused by** the need for flexibility: temps can be scaled up or down quickly if demand changes, which reduces perceived risk.\n\n5. **What this indicates about employer confidence**  \n   - These behaviors—flat or shrinking headcounts, hiring mainly for replacement, greater selectivity, delayed hiring, and heavier reliance on temporary workers—**signal weaker employer confidence** in the near‑term outlook. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - Employers are not confident enough in sustained demand to commit to broad, permanent staff increases.\n   - However, most businesses do **not** expect large layoffs and some still anticipate higher head counts over the longer term. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n   **As a result…** the pattern points to **cautious, not crisis‑level, sentiment**: employers are guarding against downside risk while keeping the option open to expand if conditions improve.\n\nIn summary, uncertainty about demand, costs, and AI’s labor implications has **caused** firms to pivot from growth hiring to maintenance, slow and tighten recruitment, and rely more on temporary staffing. **As a result**, overall hiring patterns reflect subdued, risk‑averse employer confidence in the short run, with only modest optimism reserved for the longer term.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key points from the expected answer:\n- Employers showed cautious hiring behavior.\n- More employers lowered headcounts through layoffs and attrition.\n- Those still hiring favored temporary/part-time over full-time.\n- Boston: both hiring and layoffs increased modestly → churn, not net growth.\n- IT services: modest employment increase, esp. sales/technical roles → relative bright spot.\n- Cleveland: jobseekers got more part-time offers with little/no benefits.\n- Overall indicates employer uncertainty and reluctance to commit to permanent workforce expansion.\n\nSystem answer:\n- States shift from expansion to cautious maintenance; more flat or shrinking headcounts via attrition/layoffs.\n- Notes increased use of temporary and temp-to-hire workers instead of permanent hires.\n- Frames behavior as cautious, risk‑averse, with weaker near‑term confidence and reluctance to commit to broad permanent increases.\n\nComparison:\n- It correctly captures: cautious hiring; using attrition/layoffs; more reliance on temporary workers; reluctance to commit to permanent staff; weaker employer confidence and risk aversion.\n- It does not mention: Boston churn (simultaneous modest increases in hiring and layoffs); the IT services bright spot; Cleveland’s shift to part‑time/no‑benefit offers specifically.\n- It adds broader causal narrative (uncertainty about demand, costs, AI), which is not in the expected answer and may not be supported by the referenced Beige Book segment; moreover, it introduces several detailed causal claims that are not present in the ground truth.\n- However, nothing it says directly contradicts the expected answer’s core claims about caution and reduced confidence. The omissions are about regional and sectoral specifics, which are important details in the expected answer but absence alone makes the response incomplete rather than wrong.\n\nGiven that: the system gets the main pattern (shift to cautious, maintenance-oriented hiring, more temps, reluctance to expand permanently, indicating lower confidence) but misses multiple specific factual elements that the expected answer calls out (Boston churn, IT services bright spot, Cleveland part-time offers), the best classification is that the answer is incomplete but not misleading.\n\nTherefore the verdict is PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

Consumer spending increased modestly (better than national 'inched down'). Manufacturing demand declined modestly (consistent with national challenging conditions). Employment was flat (matching national stable levels). Wages and benefits costs were up modestly (matching national modest-to-moderate). Prices rose moderately (matching national rising trend). Financial conditions loosened slightly (better than mixed national picture). Construction/real estate increased slightly (better than mixed national). Farm income prospects unchanged. Compared to national trends, Chicago showed relative strength in financial conditions, construction, and consumer spending while manufacturing weakness aligned with broader trends.",
      "system_answer": "Below is a side‑by‑side comparison of the key economic indicators for the Chicago (Seventh) District versus the contemporaneous national Beige Book picture, using consistent categories.\n\n---\n### 1. Overall Economic Activity\n- **Chicago (Seventh District)**: Economic activity was **little changed / flat** over the reporting period; contacts **expected a slight decrease in activity over the next year**.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago Summary]\n- **United States (National)**: Economic activity **“changed little on balance”**: three Districts reported slight–modest growth, five no change, and four a slight softening.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n- **Comparison**: Chicago’s **flat** conditions are **very similar to the national picture**, which on balance was also little changed with mild softening in some areas.\n\n---\n### 2. Employment\n- **Chicago**: **Employment was flat**, indicating no net job growth.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago Summary]\n- **United States**: The national narrative described overall activity as little changed and interest‑rate‑sensitive sectors as subdued; it did **not** give a clear, separate national employment growth figure, but implied **no strong acceleration** in hiring.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n- **Comparison**: Chicago’s **flat employment** appears **in line with the broadly flat‑to‑subdued national labor environment**, with no evidence that it is an outlier either stronger or weaker.\n\n---\n### 3. Consumer Spending\n- **Chicago**: **Consumer spending increased modestly.**  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago Summary]\n- **United States**: **Overall consumer spending, particularly retail goods, “inched down”** in recent weeks. Auto sales were an exception in some Districts, helped by EV demand ahead of a tax credit expiration.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n- **Comparison**: Chicago’s **modest increase** in consumer spending is **stronger than the national trend**, where spending on balance **edged down**.\n\n---\n### 4. Construction and Real Estate Activity\n- **Chicago**: **Construction and real estate activity increased slightly.**  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago Summary]\n- **United States**: Conditions in residential and commercial real estate and other interest‑rate‑sensitive sectors were reported as **mixed** across Districts—some noted improved lending and activity, others reported muted conditions.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n- **Comparison**: Chicago’s **slight increase** places it on the **firmer side** of a nationally **mixed** real‑estate picture, suggesting relatively **stronger local real‑estate momentum** than the U.S. overall narrative.\n\n---\n### 5. Business Spending / Investment\n- **Chicago**: **Business spending (investment) declined slightly.** Capital expenditures fell slightly, and expectations for future capital spending also decreased.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago Summary]\n- **United States**: Nationally, reports on business lending and investment were **mixed**: some Districts saw **improved business lending due to lower interest rates**, while others highlighted **muted activity** in interest‑rate‑sensitive sectors.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n- **Comparison**: Chicago’s **slight decline in business spending** aligns with the **“muted activity”** side of the national description and appears **weaker than those Districts that reported improved business lending.**\n\n---\n### 6. Manufacturing Activity\n- **Chicago**: \n  - Overall **manufacturing activity (demand) declined modestly** in late August and September.  \n  - Details:  \n    • **Steel**: orders flat overall; some reports of reshoring.  \n    • **Fabricated metals**: demand unchanged on balance.  \n    • **Machinery**: orders **decreased moderately**, led by weaker auto‑sector demand.  \n    • **Autos**: production **down modestly**; heavy‑truck production flat.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago Summary; Chicago Manufacturing section]\n- **United States**: **Manufacturing activity varied by District**, but **most reports described challenging conditions** due to higher tariffs and waning demand; multiple Districts (e.g., St. Louis, Richmond) reported **slight declines** in manufacturing.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary; St. Louis & Richmond District sections]\n- **Comparison**: Chicago’s **modest decline** in manufacturing is **consistent with the broader national pattern of soft or weakening manufacturing conditions**. It does not appear notably stronger or weaker than the national manufacturing environment.\n\n---\n### 7. Prices and Wages (Inflation)\n- **Chicago**:  \n  - **Prices**: **“Prices rose moderately.”**  \n  - **Wages**: **“Wages were up modestly.”**  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago Summary]\n- **United States**: Several Districts (e.g., Philadelphia) reported **prices continuing to rise moderately**, and most Districts noted cost pressures from tariffs and other inputs.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary; Philadelphia section]\n- **Comparison**: Chicago’s **moderate price increases** and **modest wage gains** are **very similar to the national pattern** of **moderate inflation with ongoing cost pressures**. Chicago does not stand out as clearly hotter or cooler on inflation.\n\n---\n### 8. Financial Conditions / Banking\n- **Chicago**: **Financial conditions loosened slightly.** More detail:  \n  - Bond and equity values rose somewhat; volatility unchanged.  \n  - Business loan demand **decreased slightly on net**, with a drop in acquisition‑related borrowing.  \n  - Business loan quality **declined modestly**, notably among auto suppliers.  \n  - Business loan rates moved **down**, but **terms tightened**.  \n  - Consumer loan demand **increased slightly**, with some pickup in mortgage refinancing; consumer loan quality was flat, and rates edged down while terms tightened slightly.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago – Banking and Finance]\n- **United States**: Nationally, **financial services conditions were mixed**: some Districts reported **improved business lending** due to lower interest rates, while others continued to highlight **muted activity**.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n- **Comparison**: Chicago’s **slight loosening of financial conditions** and mixed loan dynamics fit **within the national “mixed” pattern**. On the lending side, Chicago looks closer to the **muted‑demand** segment (given lower business loan demand) even though rates eased.\n\n---\n### 9. Nonbusiness / Nonprofit & Public‑Sector Activity\n- **Chicago**: **Nonbusiness contacts saw no change in activity.**  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago Summary]\n- **United States**: The national summary does **not** separately aggregate or characterize **nonbusiness contacts** across all Districts.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n- **Comparison**: A direct numeric or qualitative **national benchmark is not provided**. We can only say that Chicago’s nonbusiness activity was **stable**, but we cannot clearly label it as stronger or weaker than the U.S. as a whole on this dimension.\n\n---\n### 10. Agriculture\n- **Chicago**: **Prospects for 2025 farm income were unchanged.**  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago Summary]\n- **United States**: Nationally, **activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down** among reporting Districts.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n- **Comparison**: Chicago’s **unchanged farm income prospects** look **somewhat more stable** than the national statement that agriculture was **“generally down”**. Relative to that narrative, Chicago agriculture appears **slightly stronger / less weak**.\n\n---\n### 11. Energy (Where Mentioned)\n- **Chicago**: Contacts **expected a slight decrease in overall activity over the next year**, and this expectation extended specifically to the **energy sector**, which was anticipated to soften.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago Summary and sector commentary]\n- **United States**: Nationally, **energy activity was generally down** among reporting Districts.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n- **Comparison**: Chicago’s **expected slight decline** in energy‑sector activity is **broadly aligned** with the national theme of **weakened energy activity**.\n\n---\n### 12. Summary: Chicago vs. National Trends Across Indicators\n- **Overall level of activity**: Chicago’s **flat** activity mirrors the national characterization of **little change overall**, with mild softening in some areas.\n- **Employment**: Chicago’s **flat employment** fits the **broadly subdued national labor backdrop**; no clear divergence is documented.\n- **Consumer spending**: Chicago is **stronger than the national average**, with **modestly rising** consumer spending versus a national **“inched down”** pattern.\n- **Construction & real estate**: Chicago’s **slight increase** places it on the **stronger side** of nationally **mixed** real‑estate conditions.\n- **Business investment**: Chicago’s **slight decline** in business spending tracks the **muted activity** seen in many Districts and is **weaker than** those parts of the country where business lending was described as improving.\n- **Manufacturing**: Chicago’s **modest manufacturing decline** is **very similar** to the national reports of **softening or slightly declining** manufacturing due to tariffs and waning demand.\n- **Prices & wages**: Chicago’s **moderate price growth and modest wage gains** are **in line with national trends**, showing neither markedly higher nor lower inflation than the general Beige Book narrative.\n- **Financial conditions**: Chicago’s **slightly looser financial conditions, but weaker business loan demand**, fit within the national **mixed** pattern—easier rates but uneven demand and some deterioration in credit quality.\n- **Agriculture & energy**: Chicago’s **stable farm income outlook** compares **somewhat favorably** to the national description of agriculture as **generally down**, while its **expected slight energy softening** aligns with the national weakness in energy.\n\nOverall, the Chicago (Seventh) District largely **tracks national trends**, with two notable areas of relative strength—**consumer spending** and **construction/real estate**—and relative softness in **business investment**, while most other indicators (overall activity, employment, manufacturing, inflation, financial conditions, and energy) are **broadly similar to the national Beige Book picture.**",

      "judge_reasoning": "Key points in the expected answer:\n- Overall economic activity: little changed, matching national \"little change on balance\".\n- Consumer spending: increased modestly, stronger than national which \"inched down\".\n- Manufacturing: demand declined modestly, consistent with national challenging conditions.\n- Employment: flat, matching national stable levels.\n- Wages/benefits: up modestly, matching national modest‑to‑moderate.\n- Prices: rose moderately, matching national rising trend.\n- Financial conditions: loosened slightly, somewhat stronger than a mixed national picture.\n- Construction/real estate: increased slightly, stronger than mixed national picture.\n- Farm income prospects unchanged; relatively stronger than national where agriculture generally down.\n- Overall comparison: Chicago relatively strong in financial conditions, construction, and consumer spending; manufacturing weakness aligned with broader trends.\n\nCheck the system answer against each item:\n- Overall activity: states Chicago \"little changed / flat\" and national \"changed little on balance\" and calls them very similar → matches.\n- Consumer spending: clearly says Chicago \"increased modestly\" and national spending \"inched down\"; identifies Chicago as stronger → matches.\n- Manufacturing: says Chicago demand \"declined modestly\" and that nationally manufacturing had challenging conditions with slight declines; notes consistency → matches.\n- Employment: Chicago \"employment was flat\" and characterizes national labor as subdued without strong growth; says they’re in line → consistent with expected.\n- Wages/prices: explicitly \"prices rose moderately\" and \"wages were up modestly\" for Chicago; compares to national moderate increases → matches.\n- Financial conditions: Chicago \"financial conditions loosened slightly\"; national described as mixed; comparison notes slight loosening within mixed national context → consistent with expected nuance that Chicago looks somewhat on the easier side.\n- Construction/real estate: Chicago \"increased slightly\"; national \"mixed\"; says Chicago is on the firmer/stronger side → matches.\n- Agriculture: Chicago \"prospects for 2025 farm income were unchanged\"; national agriculture \"generally down\"; says Chicago is somewhat more stable/stronger → matches.\n- Overall comparison summary: highlights relative strength in consumer spending and construction/real estate; notes alignment of manufacturing weakness and broad similarity elsewhere. That aligns with expected answer, and it also mentions financial conditions within a mixed national pattern, not contradicting the ground truth.\n\nThe system adds more detail (business spending, nonbusiness sector, energy), but this does not contradict any element of the expected answer. There are no factual conflicts with the expected comparison. All key indicators and relative positions versus national are correctly captured.\n\nTherefore, the system answer is fully correct and even more detailed than required, with no apparent errors or omissions relative to the ground truth.",
