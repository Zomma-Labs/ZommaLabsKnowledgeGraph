      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected_answer": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "system_answer": "From the prior reporting period to mid‑August–September 2025, economic activity in the Twelfth District (San Francisco) moved from roughly stable conditions to a modest softening.\n\n**Prior reporting period (before mid‑August 2025)**  \n- While the exact dates and details of the prior period are not specified in the excerpts, they are described as having somewhat stronger conditions and a more positive outlook than the latest report.  \n- Relative to that earlier period, the current report characterizes the new developments as a “modest softening,” implying that earlier in 2025 economic activity was at least flat to slightly stronger, with more optimistic sentiment.\n\n**Mid‑August to September 2025 reporting period (most recent Beige Book)**  \n- **Overall activity:** Economic activity in the Twelfth District **“edged down slightly”**, indicating a small decline compared with the previous reporting period. [BeigeBook_20251015, 2025‑10‑15]\n- **Sector changes:**\n  - **Retail trade:** Weakened/decreased somewhat over this period.  \n  - **Residential real estate:** Activity decreased somewhat, indicating cooling housing market conditions.  \n  - **Agriculture and resource‑related sectors:** Weakened somewhat.  \n  - **Community support organizations and small businesses:** Conditions worsened somewhat, suggesting rising stress in more vulnerable parts of the economy.  \n  - **Commercial real estate:** Largely flat, showing little change over the period.  \n  - **Manufacturing:** Largely stable, with no major deterioration reported.  \n  - **Lending:** Also largely stable, indicating no large shift in credit activity even as other sectors softened.  \n  - **Consumer and business services:** Mixed performance, with some areas holding up better than others.\n- **Labor market, wages, and prices:** Employment was **little changed** as firms kept headcounts steady; wages grew **slightly**, and prices rose **modestly**, consistent with a slowing but not collapsing level of activity. [BeigeBook_20251015, 2025‑10‑15]\n- **Outlook:** Contacts’ overall sentiment about the economic outlook **deteriorated somewhat** compared with the previous reporting period, reflecting **growing concern about future conditions** and a mild deterioration in both activity and expectations. [BeigeBook_20251015, 2025‑10‑15]\n\n**Summary of the temporal change**  \n- **Earlier in 2025 (prior report):** Conditions were stronger or at least more stable, with a relatively better outlook.  \n- **Mid‑August to September 2025:** Economic activity **shifted to a slight decline**, with noticeable weakening in retail, housing, agriculture, and smaller/community organizations, while manufacturing, lending, and commercial real estate remained broadly stable and services were mixed. At the same time, **sentiment turned more pessimistic**, marking a modest but clear step down from the previous period.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Overall economic activity in the Twelfth District edged down slightly.\n2) Activity in retail trade either decreased or remained stable (i.e., weakened/not improving).\n3) Activity in agriculture either decreased or remained stable.\n4) Activity in residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.\n\nCheck against system answer:\n1) The system states: \"economic activity in the Twelfth District ... moved from roughly stable conditions to a modest softening\" and explicitly: \"Economic activity in the Twelfth District ‘edged down slightly’\" – this matches the ground truth characterization.\n2) Retail trade: system says \"Retail trade: Weakened/decreased somewhat\" – consistent with \"decreased or remained stable.\"\n3) Agriculture: system says \"Agriculture and resource‑related sectors: Weakened somewhat\" – consistent with decreased activity.\n4) Residential real estate: system says \"Residential real estate: Activity decreased somewhat\" – consistent with the expected answer.\n\nThe system adds extra sectoral and temporal detail (manufacturing, lending, sentiment, etc.), but none of it contradicts the expected answer. There are no factual conflicts with the key points; all required elements are present and correctly stated.\n\nTherefore, the answer is fully correct relative to the expected answer, just more detailed.",
