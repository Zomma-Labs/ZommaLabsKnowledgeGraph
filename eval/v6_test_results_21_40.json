      "question": "Which sectors faced labor shortages due to immigration policy changes?",
      "expected": "Labor supply in the hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing sectors was reportedly strained in several Districts due to recent changes to immigration policies.",
      "predicted": "Sectors reported as facing labor shortages (or hiring difficulties/strained labor supply) that were explicitly or implicitly linked to immigration policy changes or shifts in immigration were:\n\n- **Construction**  \n  - New York District: Several construction businesses had difficulty finding workers **\u201cdue to shifts in immigration policy.\u201d**  \n  - Philadelphia District: A construction contact warned that rising construction demand, given the **decline in foreign\u2011born workers**, would lead to a **significant labor shortage** (a forward\u2011looking immigration\u2011related concern).\n\n- **Leisure and Hospitality (including hotels and restaurants)**  \n  - New York District: Several leisure and hospitality businesses had difficulty finding workers **\u201cdue to shifts in immigration policy.\u201d**  \n  - National Summary: Labor supply in the **hospitality sector (hotels, restaurants & leisure)** was reported as **strained in several Districts** (cause not specified in that passage, but it reinforces that this sector is under labor pressure).\n\n- **Agriculture**  \n  - National Summary: Labor supply in **agriculture** was **strained in several Districts** (the excerpt does not explicitly attribute this to immigration policy but identifies agriculture as a sector with notable labor\u2011supply problems).\n\n- **General, cross\u2011sector labor shortages (St. Louis District)**  \n  - St. Louis District contacts reported that **\u201cimmigration policies have been resulting in labor shortages,\u201d** without limiting this statement to particular industries.  \n  - In the same District, contacts in **manufacturing, construction, and agriculture** reported labor shortages; however, the text does **not** explicitly tie each of these sectoral shortages to immigration policy sentence\u2011by\u2011sentence, only the overall shortages.\n\n- **Manufacturing**  \n  - St. Louis District: Manufacturing is listed among sectors with reported labor shortages.  \n  - The provided excerpts do **not** explicitly say that manufacturing shortages are caused by immigration policy, so any link here is indirect, via the general St. Louis statement that immigration policies are resulting in labor shortages.\n\n- **Resource\u2011related sectors**  \n  - San Francisco District: Several contacts reported difficulties finding enough labor in **agriculture and resource\u2011related sectors**.  \n  - In the excerpt given, these shortages are **not explicitly attributed** to immigration policy.\n\n**In summary (sectors clearly or plausibly affected):**\n- Clearly and directly tied to immigration policy changes or shifts:  \n  - **Construction** (New York; Philadelphia as a prospective shortage)  \n  - **Leisure & hospitality / hospitality (hotels, restaurants & leisure)** (New York; strained nationally)  \n  - **General labor across multiple sectors** (St. Louis District, unspecified sectors in the immigration sentence)\n\n- Reported as facing labor shortages or strained labor supply, with weaker or indirect textual linkage to immigration policy in the excerpts:  \n  - **Agriculture** (strained nationally; shortages in St. Louis and San Francisco)  \n  - **Manufacturing** (shortages in St. Louis)  \n  - **Resource\u2011related sectors** (San Francisco)\n",

      "question": "How did employers' hiring preferences change?",
      "expected": "Employers that reported hiring generally noted improved labor availability, and some favored hiring temporary and part-time workers over offering full-time employment opportunities.",
      "predicted": "From early 2025 into the October 15, 2025 Beige Book reporting period, employers\u2019 hiring preferences moved along a clear timeline from modest expansion toward caution, replacement\u2011only hiring, and more flexible arrangements. The Beige Book does not give precise start dates for each shift, but it lets us reconstruct how preferences evolved over the course of 2025 and by the time of the October 15, 2025 report.\n\n### Early\u2013Mid 2025: From expansion to \u201ccooling\u201d and flat headcounts\n\nBy the first half of 2025 (as summarized in the National Summary and early\u20112025 District narratives), districts were already reporting a move away from broad, expansionary hiring:\n\n- **National Summary (early\u2013mid 2025)**  \n  \u2022 Labor demand was described as **\u201cgenerally muted,\u201d** and **\u201cin most Districts, more employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition\u201d** rather than adding net new positions. [National Summary > Labor Markets, BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  \u2022 This marks the point where employers broadly **shifted from growth hiring to maintenance or slight reduction**, relying more on attrition and selected layoffs instead of active expansion.\n\n- **Boston (first half of 2025)**  \n  \u2022 Reports noted that **\u201cemployment was flat overall,\u201d** with many manufacturers **keeping head counts steady because of uncertainty.** [Boston > Labor Markets]  \n  \u2022 Employers\u2019 preference here was to **hold staff levels constant** and delay expansion until conditions were clearer.\n\n- **Atlanta (first half to mid\u20112025)**  \n  \u2022 The District reported a developing **\u201chiring chill,\u201d** with firms **\u201cgenerally keeping employment levels flat\u201d** and even **\u201cwelcomed attrition and fewer head count additions in areas of growth.\u201d** [Atlanta > Labor Markets]  \n  \u2022 This shows a distinct preference shift: instead of backfilling every departure or adding new roles, many firms were **content to let head counts drift down via attrition** and to be highly selective about any new hires.\n  \u2022 At the same time, Atlanta contacts observed that **\u201capplicants for open positions in technical roles were relatively scarce compared with applicants for other roles,\u201d** so even as overall demand cooled, **technical skills remained in short supply.** [Atlanta > Labor Markets]\n\n### Mid 2025: Greater selectivity and more replacement\u2011focused hiring\n\nAs 2025 progressed, multiple Districts described a common pattern: employers were still hiring, but primarily **to replace departing workers** rather than to expand.\n\n- **National Pattern (mid 2025)**  \n  \u2022 The National Summary indicates that, in most Districts, employers increasingly **lowered or held head counts steady via layoffs and attrition** rather than expansion. [National Summary > Labor Markets]  \n  \u2022 This reflects a broad **preference for replacement\u2011only or shrink\u2011through\u2011attrition strategies**, with new hiring done more cautiously and selectively.\n\n- **Philadelphia (mid 2025)**  \n  \u2022 District\u2011wide, **\u201cemployment levels\u2026increased slightly,\u201d** making Philadelphia a mild exception to outright flat or falling employment. [National Summary > Highlights by District > Philadelphia]  \n  \u2022 However, staffing contacts reported that **\u201cdemand for workers was mostly flat,\u201d** and **one staffing firm reported strong demand mainly to fill recently vacated positions**, highlighting that even where employment was edging up, the underlying preference was **replacement hiring, not aggressive workforce expansion.** [Philadelphia > Labor Markets]\n\n- **Sectoral tightness amid muted demand (mid 2025)**  \n  \u2022 The National Summary also noted that, despite muted overall hiring demand, **labor supply remained strained in manufacturing, construction, and hospitality** in several Districts. [National Summary > Labor Markets]  \n  \u2022 This implies that, through mid\u20112025, many employers in those sectors still had **persistent hiring needs and skill shortages**, particularly for certain technical or trade roles, even as they overall adopted more cautious hiring strategies.\n\n### Late 2025 (report dated October 15, 2025): Cautious, flat, or declining headcounts and more flexible arrangements\n\nBy the time of the **October 15, 2025 Beige Book** (covering roughly late summer to early fall 2025 depending on District), the cooling trend had matured into a broad pattern of **caution, selective replacement, and, in some places, outright declines in employment**.\n\nAcross districts, employers\u2019 preferences at this point can be characterized as follows:\n\n#### 1. From expansion to maintaining or trimming staff\n\n- **General pattern (across multiple Districts)**  \n  \u2022 Employers had **\u201cshifted away from expansion and toward maintaining or trimming existing staff levels.\u201d** Most firms were **hiring primarily to replace departing workers**, holding headcounts steady or **reducing them through attrition and layoffs.** Several contacts described a general **\u201chiring chill\u201d** and **less eagerness to fill vacancies.** [BeigeBook_20251015, 2025\u201110\u201115; National Summary > Labor Markets]\n\n- **Dallas (late 2025 reporting period)**  \n  \u2022 **\u201cEmployment fell over the reporting period,\u201d** and staffing firms **\u201creported slow activity as firms remained cautious with hiring and professionals were reluctant to switch positions.\u201d** [Dallas > Labor Markets]  \n  \u2022 This reflects a concrete shift toward **reduced headcount and subdued hiring**, with employers opting not to compete aggressively for talent.\n\n- **Minneapolis (late 2025)**  \n  \u2022 The District reported that **\u201cemployment was down slightly since the last report,\u201d** with surveys showing **declining head count and softening labor demand.** [Minneapolis > Labor Markets]  \n  \u2022 Employers increasingly preferred **small reductions** or **flat staffing** rather than expansion.\n\n- **Boston and Richmond (late 2025)**  \n  \u2022 Boston: **\u201cEmployment was flat overall,\u201d** and manufacturing employment was **\u201cunchanged on balance.\u201d** [Boston > Labor Markets]  \n  \u2022 Richmond: **\u201cEmployment in the Fifth District, on balance, was unchanged,\u201d** with some firms expanding and **\u201cseveral other firms\u201d reducing head counts by delaying hiring or cutting positions.** [Richmond > Labor Markets]  \n  \u2022 These Districts show mature forms of the **hold\u2011steady / selective reduction** preference.\n\n- **Philadelphia (late 2025)**  \n  \u2022 Still an outlier, with **employment increasing slightly** overall. [National Summary > Philadelphia]  \n  \u2022 But staffing contacts emphasized **flat demand for workers** and replacement\u2011focused hiring, confirming that the **underlying preference remained cautious** despite the slight net increase. [Philadelphia > Labor Markets]\n\n#### 2. Work arrangements: shift toward temp and temp\u2011to\u2011hire\n\n- **Minneapolis \u2013 Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula (late 2025)**  \n  \u2022 A staffing contact in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula reported that **\u201cmarket uncertainty has contributed to a relative decline in direct hiring in favor of temp and temp\u2011to\u2011hire work,\u201d** with **an increase in temp and temp\u2011to\u2011hire roles rather than direct hires.** [Minneapolis > Labor Markets]  \n  \u2022 This is explicit, time\u2011stamped evidence that by the late\u20112025 reporting period, some employers were **changing not only how much they hired but also *how* they hired**, preferring flexible, contingent arrangements over permanent, direct hires to manage uncertainty and risk.\n\n#### 3. Skills and qualifications: continued scarcity in key technical roles\n\n- **Atlanta (persisting through the 2025 period)**  \n  \u2022 As of the 2025 reporting period, employers in the Atlanta District continued to report that **\u201capplicants for open positions in technical roles were relatively scarce compared with applicants for other roles.\u201d** [Atlanta > Labor Markets]  \n  \u2022 This indicates that even as overall hiring cooled and employers became more selective, **technical skills remained at a premium**, shaping preferences toward candidates with specific technical qualifications and making employers more willing to keep searching or leave roles open rather than compromise on skill fit.\n\n#### 4. Mechanisms and intensity of reductions\n\n- **Layoffs vs. attrition (late 2025)**  \n  \u2022 The National Summary stated that **\u201cmore employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition\u201d**, but District reports **do not systematically quantify** the balance between layoffs and attrition or how many employers followed each path. [National Summary > Labor Markets]  \n  \u2022 Atlanta gave a concrete example of firms **\u201cwelcoming attrition\u201d** as part of the \u201chiring chill,\u201d suggesting a preference for **passive reductions** (not backfilling departures) over active downsizing through large layoffs. [Atlanta > Labor Markets]\n\n- **Benefits and part\u2011time work**  \n  \u2022 Some Beige Book context (outside the specific excerpts cited here) mentions **more offers for part\u2011time or flexible roles**, but the evidence provided in this set **does not explicitly state** that such roles came with \u201clittle or no benefits.\u201d  \n  \u2022 On the basis of the October 15, 2025 report excerpts alone, we can say that by late 2025, **employers were leaning more on flexible arrangements (e.g., temp, temp\u2011to\u2011hire)**, but we cannot precisely date or quantify any change in benefit generosity.\n\n### Overall chronological arc (through October 15, 2025)\n\nPutting these pieces together chronologically over 2025:\n\n1. **Early 2025** \u2013 Employer preferences begin to **cool from expansion**:  \n   \u2022 Labor demand turns **\u201cmuted\u201d**; several Districts (e.g., Boston, Atlanta) report **flat employment** and growing use of **attrition and delayed hiring** to manage uncertainty.  \n   \u2022 Technical roles, especially in Atlanta, remain **hard to fill**, so employers continue to prize candidates with in\u2011demand technical skills.\n\n2. **Mid 2025** \u2013 Caution becomes the norm; replacement hiring dominates:  \n   \u2022 Nationally, **more employers are holding or lowering head counts** rather than expanding. [National Summary > Labor Markets]  \n   \u2022 Hiring is **increasingly focused on replacing departures**, as seen clearly in Philadelphia\u2019s staffing contacts, with only **slight net job growth** in a few regions. [Philadelphia > Labor Markets]  \n   \u2022 Some sectors (manufacturing, construction, hospitality) still experience **tight labor supply**, keeping demand for certain skills elevated even as total hiring slows.[National Summary > Labor Markets]\n\n3. **Late 2025 (Beige Book dated October 15, 2025)** \u2013 Widespread hiring chill, selective hiring, and more contingent work:  \n   \u2022 Across most Districts, including Dallas and Minneapolis, net **employment is flat or declining**, reflecting employer preferences to **trim or maintain staff rather than expand.** [Dallas > Labor Markets; Minneapolis > Labor Markets; Boston > Labor Markets; Richmond > Labor Markets]  \n   \u2022 Employers are **less eager to fill open roles**, with a pronounced **\u201chiring chill\u201d** in places like Atlanta, and show a clear **preference for temp and temp\u2011to\u2011hire positions over direct hires** in at least some areas (e.g., Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula). [Atlanta > Labor Markets; Minneapolis > Labor Markets]  \n   \u2022 Technical qualifications remain particularly valued where applicant pools are still thin, especially in the Atlanta District. [Atlanta > Labor Markets]\n\nBy the October 15, 2025 reporting period, then, employers\u2019 hiring preferences had evolved from earlier expansionary phases into a broadly **cautious, selective, and risk\u2011averse stance**: hiring mostly to **replace** rather than grow, sometimes taking advantage of **attrition to reduce headcounts**, and in some regions **substituting temp and temp\u2011to\u2011hire arrangements for direct, permanent hires**, all while continuing to compete for scarce technical talent in key sectors and regions.\n",

      "question": "How did wages grow across districts?",
      "expected": "Wages grew across all reporting Districts, generally at a modest to moderate pace.",
      "predicted": "Across districts, wages generally increased at a restrained pace, but the language used points to small differences in strength. Side\u2011by\u2011side:\n\n**Overall pattern**  \nAcross all reporting Federal Reserve Districts, wage growth was described as **modest to moderate**, with no district characterized as having rapid or sharp wage gains. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n---\n\n**Softest wage growth**\n- **Kansas City (Tenth District)**  \n  \u2022 Wage growth was explicitly described as **\u201csubdued\u201d**, weaker than \u201cmodest\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d wording used elsewhere.  \n  \u2022 This subdued growth was linked to **waning labor demand** and the **availability of former federal workers**, which eased upward wage pressure. [Evidence 1\u20133]\n\nIn contrast, other districts (below) reported at least modest wage gains rather than \u201csubdued\u201d conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Modest wage growth group**\n- **New York (Second District)**  \n  \u2022 \u201cWage growth remained **modest** over the reported period.\u201d [Evidence 10]  \n  \u2022 This places New York in the middle of the spectrum\u2014firmer than Kansas City\u2019s \u201csubdued,\u201d but not as strong as \u201cmoderate.\u201d\n\n- **Philadelphia (Third District)**  \n  \u2022 \u201cWages \u2026 **rose at modest pre\u2011pandemic rates**, continuing a prior pattern.\u201d [Evidence 5]  \n  \u2022 \u201cThe pace of wage increases \u2026 **matched modest pre\u2011pandemic rates**.\u201d [Evidence 6]  \n  \u2022 Relative to Kansas City, Philadelphia saw *steadier* gains; relative to Richmond (below), the emphasis is on \u201cmodest\u201d rather than \u201cmoderate.\u201d\n\n- **Cleveland (Fourth District)**  \n  \u2022 Wage pressures were reported as **modest**. [Evidence 8]  \n  \u2022 Like New York and Philadelphia, Cleveland sits in the **modest** category, implying similar, restrained wage increases.\n\nTaken together, **New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland** form a cluster with **modest** wage growth\u2014stronger than Kansas City\u2019s \u201csubdued,\u201d but weaker than the explicit \u201cmoderate\u201d wording in Richmond.\n\n---\n\n**Upper end of the range**\n- **Richmond (Fifth District)**  \n  \u2022 \u201cWage growth in the Fifth District **remained moderate**.\u201d [Evidence 7, 9]  \n  \u2022 This \u201cmoderate\u201d description is somewhat stronger than the \u201cmodest\u201d language used for New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland, and definitely firmer than the \u201csubdued\u201d conditions in Kansas City.\n\nCompared side\u2011by\u2011side, Richmond shows the **strongest explicitly documented wage growth** among the districts for which we have quoted language.\n\n---\n\n**Other districts mentioned but less precisely documented**\n- **Minneapolis (Ninth District)**  \n  \u2022 Earlier characterization: wage growth **remained moderate**, but the new evidence set does **not** include a direct quote confirming that exact term for the Ninth District. Its placement near Richmond in the \u201cmoderate\u201d category is therefore **inferred**, not documented.\n\n- **Atlanta (Sixth District)**  \n  \u2022 Previously described as experiencing **modest wage growth in roughly the 1\u20133 percent range**. This suggests growth comparable to the **modest** districts, but we do not have a fresh, verbatim phrase in the new evidence.\n\n- **Chicago (Seventh District)**  \n  \u2022 Reported earlier as **modest** wage growth, but this wording is not independently confirmed in the new evidence excerpts. The mapping of \u201cChicago\u201d to \u201cSeventh District\u201d is standard Fed structure but not restated in the excerpts.\n\n- **Dallas (Eleventh District)** and **San Francisco (Twelfth District)**  \n  \u2022 Dallas was earlier described as having **modest** wage growth, and San Francisco as **slight** wage growth, both implying they are at or below the modest range. However, the precise phrases do not appear in the new evidence set.\n\n- **Boston (First District)** and **St. Louis (Eighth District)**  \n  \u2022 Included in the general statement that all reporting districts saw **modest to moderate** wage gains, but without district\u2011specific phrasing in the new evidence.\n\nSo, in side\u2011by\u2011side qualitative terms based on documented language:\n- **Weakest**: Kansas City \u2013 **subdued** wage growth, held down by softer labor demand and added worker supply. [Evidence 1\u20133]\n- **Middle (modest)**: New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland \u2013 **modest** wage gains, with Philadelphia explicitly at **modest pre\u2011pandemic rates**. [Evidence 5, 6, 8, 10]\n- **Stronger end (moderate)**: Richmond \u2013 wage growth **remained moderate**, the clearest case of somewhat firmer gains. [Evidence 7, 9]\n- **Likely within the same modest\u2013moderate band but less precisely documented**: Boston, Atlanta, Chicago/Seventh, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, San Francisco \u2013 generally described (in earlier material) as having modest to moderate or slight wage growth, but without direct wording in the new excerpts.\n\nAcross all of these, the comparison shows **narrow differences**: no district is described as having rapid wage inflation; instead, conditions range from **subdued** (Kansas City) through **modest** (New York/Philadelphia/Cleveland and likely several others) up to **moderate** (Richmond and possibly Minneapolis).",

      "expected": "Labor cost pressures intensified in recent weeks due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses.",
      "predicted": "Labor cost pressures intensified because several reinforcing factors raised what firms had to pay per worker, even when base wages were not rising rapidly.\n\n1. Rising non\u2011wage compensation directly increased labor costs.\n   - Employers faced outsized increases in the cost of providing health insurance benefits. This was caused by significantly higher employer\u2011sponsored health insurance expenses, and in some cases sharply higher insurance costs more broadly (e.g., liability insurance). [BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - As a result, total compensation per worker increased even when hourly or salary pay did not accelerate. This raised firms\u2019 overall labor cost structures and unit labor costs, especially where productivity did not rise enough to offset these higher benefit costs. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. Tight labor supply forced firms to bid up compensation.\n   - Labor supply was reduced or strained in key sectors, notably construction, and firms had difficulty finding enough workers. This was caused by ongoing labor shortages and hiring challenges in multiple Districts (e.g., Boston and St. Louis construction shortages; hiring difficulties tied to immigration\u2011related vacancies in the Philadelphia area; construction labor tightness in New York). [BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - As a result, firms had to offer higher wages and better compensation packages to attract and retain workers. In construction in particular, Boston commercial real estate contacts reported that \u201cconstruction costs continued to face upward pressure from labor shortages,\u201d meaning scarce labor directly pushed up project and labor costs. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n3. Sector\u2011specific shortages amplified the pressures.\n   - Construction: This sector experienced especially strained labor pools in several Districts, which was caused by a combination of strong or steady demand and limited availability of qualified workers. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - As a result, construction wages and total project costs rose, feeding directly into higher labor cost pressures for firms in that sector.\n\nPutting these channels together:\n- Higher insurance and benefit costs increased non\u2011wage compensation.\n- Simultaneously, tight labor markets and sector\u2011specific shortages forced firms to raise pay and absorb these higher benefit costs.\n- As a result, overall labor costs and unit labor costs rose, and businesses reported that labor cost pressures had intensified.\n\nInformation limitations:\n- The evidence confirms broad statements that manufacturing and agricultural labor supply were strained in \u201cseveral Districts,\u201d but does not identify those Districts by name or quantify the size of employer health insurance cost increases. These elements therefore remain general rather than District\u2011specific. [BeigeBook_20251015]",

      "predicted": "During the October 2025 Beige Book reporting period (culminating in the October 15, 2025 release), prices moved as follows over time:\n\n**Late August\u2013September 2025 (core of the reporting window)**\n- In the **Chicago (Seventh) District**, \u201cprices rose moderately in late August and September,\u201d and firms expected a similar pace of growth over the next 12 months. Nonlabor input costs, including **energy and raw materials (aluminum, copper, steel)**, also **rose moderately**, contributing to overall pricing pressure [BeigeBook_20251015].\n- Other districts (e.g., **Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Kansas City, San Francisco, Richmond**) described prices during \u201cthe period\u201d as **moderately or modestly rising**, indicating that through late August and September, selling prices were **continuing to edge up rather than staying flat or declining** [BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n**Throughout the October 2025 reporting period (as summarized on October 15, 2025)**\n- **National picture:** The October 15, 2025 Beige Book national summary reported that prices **\u201crose further\u201d** during the reporting period. Overall price growth across the country was described as **modest to moderate**, rather than rapid or accelerating [BeigeBook_20251015].\n- **Input costs:** The report noted **faster-rising input costs**, including **imports, insurance, health care, and technology services**, which put upward pressure on firms\u2019 costs and helped drive the continued price increases [BeigeBook_20251015].\n- **By district (during the period):**\n  - **Boston (First District):** \u201cPrices increased at a moderate pace\u201d during the period.\n  - **New York (Second District):** Selling prices were \u201crising moderately\u201d; the **pace** of price increases was **elevated but little changed** from earlier periods.\n  - **Philadelphia (Third District):** Prices \u201ccontinued to rise moderately\u201d during the period.\n  - **Richmond (Fifth District):** Year\u2011over\u2011year price growth \u201cremained within a moderate range,\u201d indicating continued but controlled increases.\n  - **Atlanta (Sixth District):** \u201cPrices rose moderately.\u201d\n  - **Chicago (Seventh District):** \u201cPrices rose moderately in late August and September,\u201d carrying through into the October report.\n  - **Kansas City (Tenth District):** Prices \u201crose at a moderate pace.\u201d\n  - **San Francisco (Twelfth District):** \u201cPrices rose modestly **as in the prior reporting period**,\u201d indicating that the **pace of increases was essentially unchanged** [BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n**Change over time (relative to earlier periods)**\n- Compared with prior Beige Book periods, **prices were still increasing** rather than stabilizing, but the **pace of increase was broadly similar**:\n  - The national summary\u2019s \u201crose further\u201d language shows that the upward trend in prices continued into the October 2025 period.\n  - Districts like **New York** and **San Francisco** explicitly noted that the **pace of price increases was little changed** from earlier periods.\n  - Descriptions such as **\u201cmoderate\u201d** or **\u201cmodest\u201d** across many districts indicate **continued, steady inflation** rather than a new acceleration or a slowdown.\n\n**Overall narrative for October 2025**\n- Over the reporting window that covered **late August through the weeks leading up to October 15, 2025**, prices across the United States **continued to rise at a modest to moderate pace**.\n- Input costs (especially **imports, insurance, health care, technology services, and energy/raw materials**) moved up, supporting further increases in selling prices.\n- The **direction** of change was consistently **upward**, while the **rate** of increase was **broadly similar to previous periods**, not sharply faster or slower.\n\nThus, chronologically, the Beige Book shows that from late August through September and into the early October 2025 reporting cutoff, prices **kept edging higher**, with no major inflection point\u2014just a continuation of moderate price increases across most districts.\n",

San Francisco \u2013 retail trade and demand effects\n   - **Cause:** Retailers\u2019 prices had already been raised, in part due to tariffs.\n   - **Effect:** Retailers in the San Francisco District \u201cattributed lower demand partly to higher **tariff\u2011induced prices**,\u201d meaning consumers were facing noticeably higher prices due to tariffs.

[BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Atlanta > Consumer Spending]\n   - As a result, in Atlanta, tariffs were already affecting pricing plans, even where final consumer prices had not yet fully adjusted.\n\n6. Mixed or partial absorption versus pass\u2011through\n- **Cause:** Firms\u2019 decisions to protect market share, maintain customer relationships, or cope with competitive pressures.\n- **Effect:** While the national summary and District reports show many instances of firms raising prices because of tariffs, they also state that **pass\u2011through \u201cvaried\u201d** and in some cases was only partial or gradual. [BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary > Prices]\n- As a result, in some districts and sectors, firms absorbed part of the tariff\u2011induced cost increases in their margins, leading to **smaller or delayed price hikes**, though specific named examples of firms fully holding prices flat are not detailed in the available excerpts.\n\nSummary of cause\u2013effect relationships across districts\n- **Common cause nationwide:** Tariffs increased import and input costs across many sectors and Districts.\n- **Primary effect nationwide:** In retail trades and manufacturing, these higher costs were **fully passed on** nationally, raising consumer and producer prices.\n- **Differential district effects:**\n  - Districts like **Chicago (smaller retailers), Minneapolis (manufacturers), Dallas and Richmond (manufacturing), Philadelphia (suppliers), and San Francisco (retail)** show clear evidence that tariff\u2011driven costs **caused** firms to raise prices, sometimes enough to dampen demand.\n  - Districts like **Atlanta** show tariffs already affecting **pricing expectations and plans**, implying forthcoming price increases.\n  - Because \u201cthe extent\u201d of pass\u2011through \u201cvaried across many Districts,\u201d some firms in some areas likely absorbed more of the tariff costs, but the precise District\u2011by\u2011District pattern of absorption versus pass\u2011through is not fully specified in the evidence provided.\n\nOverall, tariffs acted as an upstream shock to costs that, in many districts and sectors, was transmitted downstream into higher prices, with the strength and timing of that transmission depending on local conditions and firm behavior.",

In other words, sales volumes were **flat relative to the same period a year before**; there was no notable increase or decrease in overall home sales.  \n\n- **Same period: change in housing inventory (up to October 15, 2025)**  \n  While sales remained flat, **housing inventory in the Boston District increased notably** over this same year\u2011over\u2011year period.

      "expected": "Commercial construction and financial services contacts noted an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates. Some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates.",
      "predicted": "Lower interest rates affected business activity mainly by making credit cheaper and nudging up borrowing and investment, but this effect was modest and very uneven across sectors and Federal Reserve Districts.\n\nBelow is the cause\u2011and\u2011effect chain, organized by channel and region, using the requested language.\n\n---\n\n1. **Cheaper borrowing \u2192 some firms borrowed more \u2192 moderate rise in business lending**\n\n- **Mechanism (cause):** Lower policy and market interest rates reduced the cost of loans.\n  - This was caused by the Federal Reserve easing financial conditions, which lowered the rates banks charged households and businesses.\n\n- **Effect on borrowing in districts where demand clearly rose:**\n  - **Cleveland (Fourth District):**\n    - Bankers reported that **\u201cloan demand increased moderately in recent weeks, as both households and businesses were encouraged by lower interest rates.\u201d**\n    - This was caused by businesses seeing lower borrowing costs as an opportunity to finance projects and investments at more attractive terms.\n  - **San Francisco (Twelfth District):**\n    - Contacts noted that **\u201crecent reductions in interest rates started to spur additional demand for loans,\u201d** even though overall commercial loan demand remained muted.\n    - This was caused by some borrowers re\u2011evaluating planned projects once financing costs fell, prompting them to move forward with new or delayed loans.\n  - **Dallas (Eleventh District):**\n    - Banks reported that **loan demand \u201crose modestly over the reporting period.\u201d**\n    - This was caused in part by easier financing conditions; even though overall economic activity was flat, lower rates made borrowing somewhat more attractive.\n  - **National Summary:**\n    - It noted that **\u201csome reports\u201d cited improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates.**\n    - This was caused by a broad but not universal response of firms and banks to cheaper credit.\n\n**Result:** In these areas, lower interest rates **caused a moderate pickup in business lending**, rather than a surge. This supported some increase in business activity, especially where firms were already inclined to invest.\n\n---\n\n2. **Cheaper borrowing \u2192 more capital spending in some sectors (especially commercial construction/real estate) \u2192 localized boosts to activity**\n\n- **Mechanism (cause):** Lower short\u2011term rates reduced financing costs for construction and development projects, which tend to be highly rate\u2011sensitive.\n\n- **Cleveland commercial real estate and construction:**\n  - A **commercial builder** and **real estate developers** in Cleveland reported that **firms undertook more capital spending as short\u2011term interest rates declined.**\n  - This was caused by the combination of lower financing costs and firms\u2019 efforts to adapt to other pressures (such as tariffs), making it more attractive to invest in facilities or related projects.\n  - As a result, **commercial construction and related real estate activity saw firmer demand** in this district compared with earlier periods.\n\n**Result:** In parts of the commercial construction and real estate sector\u2014particularly in Cleveland\u2014**lower interest rates caused firms to step up capital spending**, which in turn supported related business activity (design, building, materials, some services). However, the evidence does not detail specific project types or quantify the increase.\n\n---\n\n3. **Lower rates \u2192 limited or no increase in hiring (based on evidence) \u2192 effects concentrated in finance/investment, not labor**\n\n- **Mechanism (expected in theory):** When firms invest more and undertake new projects, they often hire to staff them.\n\n- **What the evidence actually shows:**\n  - The excerpts **do not directly report that firms increased hiring or labor demand because of lower interest rates.**\n  - Any link from lower rates to expanded hiring remains an **economic inference**, not a documented outcome in the cited Beige Book passages.\n\n**Result:** The **observed impact of lower rates was mainly on borrowing and capital spending**, not clearly on employment. If hiring increased, it is not explicitly attributed to lower interest rates in these reports.\n\n---\n\n4. **Lower rates \u2192 uneven effects across districts \u2192 some areas flat or weaker despite cheaper credit**\n\nEven with lower rates, **caution and other headwinds** caused lending and business activity to stay flat or fall in several districts.\n\n- **New York (Second District): lower rates but weaker business loan demand**\n  - Banks reported that **overall loan demand declined**, and **small\u2011to\u2011medium sized banks** said this was **because demand for business loans sagged**, while consumer loans and commercial mortgages held steady.\n  - This was caused not by high borrowing costs, but by **weak business appetite for borrowing and elevated uncertainty**, which outweighed the incentive from lower rates.\n  - As a result, **business lending contracted** and overall economic activity in the district edged down.\n\n- **Chicago (Seventh District): lower rates but softer business loan demand and M&A**\n  - Business loan demand **decreased slightly on net**, and a contact linked this directly to a **decline in acquisition (M&A) activity**.\n  - This was caused by firms scaling back deals and expansion plans, so even though financing was cheaper, **fewer transactions needed financing**.\n  - As a result, **lower rates did not translate into stronger business lending** in Chicago; instead, deal volume and associated borrowing declined.\n\n- **Atlanta (Sixth District): flat lending amid uncertainty**\n  - **Overall loan growth was flat**, and loan demand from both corporate borrowers and consumers was **muted amid persistent economic uncertainty**.\n  - This was caused by businesses adopting a \u201cwait\u2011and\u2011see\u201d stance, holding back on projects despite cheaper credit.\n  - As a result, **lower interest rates failed to generate a noticeable increase in borrowing or spending** in this district.\n\n- **Kansas City (Tenth District): little to no change in loan demand**\n  - Banks **\u201cnoted little to no change in loan demand across categories,\u201d** and CRE loan demand was stable even as CRE activity declined moderately.\n  - This was caused by a weakening commercial real estate environment and cautious attitudes, which offset any stimulus from lower rates.\n  - As a result, **credit flows and related business activity remained roughly unchanged**.\n\n- **San Francisco (Twelfth District): tentative response, ongoing caution**\n  - While **recent rate cuts started to spur additional loan demand**, **demand for commercial loans remained muted** and borrowers **\u201cremained cautious in light of high uncertainty.\u201d**\n  - This was caused by firms\u2019 concerns about the broader economic outlook, which limited their willingness to commit to large projects.\n  - As a result, **the positive effect of lower rates on business borrowing was weak and gradual**.\n\n- **Philadelphia (Third District): declines in key business credit categories**\n  - Banks reported a **\u201cmoderate decline in lending,\u201d** driven by a **strong decline in commercial and industrial (C&I) lending** and a **modest decline in commercial real estate loans**.\n  - This was caused by reduced demand for business credit in core lending categories, likely reflecting lower confidence and scaled\u2011back expansion plans rather than borrowing costs.\n  - As a result, **business borrowing and associated investment fell despite lower interest rates**, and overall business activity increased only slightly.\n\n- **St. Louis (Eighth District): mostly unchanged but pockets of strength**\n  - The district said **\u201cbanking activity has remained unchanged since our previous report, with moderate loan demand and overall credit conditions remaining strong.\u201d**\n  - Within that, a **Memphis banker** cited **strong commercial loan demand** and a **bullish midterm outlook**.\n  - This was caused by stronger local conditions or optimism in parts of the district, even as the broader district averages remained flat.\n  - As a result, **the influence of lower rates appeared in localized pockets of stronger business lending rather than a district\u2011wide surge.**\n\n**Overall result:** In many districts, **uncertainty, weaker M&A, and sector\u2011specific slowdowns caused businesses to hold back**, so lower rates **did not uniformly lead to more borrowing or activity**. Instead, the response was modest and highly dependent on local conditions.\n\n---\n\n5. **Lower rates \u2192 mixed effects by sector (some rate\u2011sensitive areas still weak)**\n\n- **Residential real estate in Cleveland:**\n  - Contacts in **residential construction and real estate** reported **declining demand** and anticipated **flat demand** in coming months, even as short\u2011term rates fell.\n  - One broker noted that homeowners were reluctant to sell because they did not want to lose their **existing lower mortgage rates**.\n  - This was caused by a \u201clock\u2011in\u201d effect from earlier low-rate mortgages and other housing\u2011market frictions, which overrode the stimulative effect of recent rate cuts.\n  - As a result, **residential housing activity stayed soft**, despite being a typically interest\u2011rate\u2011sensitive sector.\n\n- **Philadelphia business credit (C&I and CRE):**\n  - As noted, **C&I lending declined strongly** and **commercial real estate lending declined modestly**, even though these are usually rate\u2011sensitive.\n  - This was caused more by **weak demand and risk concerns** than by financing costs.\n  - As a result, **these sectors did not show the expected pickup from lower rates.**\n\n**Result:** Lower rates **sometimes failed to boost even interest\u2011sensitive segments**, because other factors\u2014like prior low mortgages, risk aversion, and weak demand\u2014dominated.\n\n---\n\n6. **Net effect on business activity: modest support, but no broad surge in production**\n\nBringing the channels together:\n\n- **Direct financial channel:**\n  - Lower interest rates **caused borrowing costs to fall**, which **caused moderate increases in business loan demand** in some districts (notably Cleveland, San Francisco, and Dallas) and **supported additional capital spending** in certain commercial construction/real estate niches.\n\n- **Offsetting forces:**\n  - At the same time, **economic uncertainty, weaker M&A activity, sector\u2011specific slowdowns, and homeowner lock\u2011in effects caused many firms and households to remain cautious**, which **caused loan demand to be flat or declining** in other districts (New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, parts of San Francisco).\n\n- **Production and overall activity:**\n  - Because the improvement in borrowing and capital spending was **only moderate and geographically uneven**, and because some key credit categories (like C&I loans in Philadelphia) declined, **the effect on overall production and broader business activity was limited so far**.\n  - In several districts, overall economic activity was described as **flat, slightly up, or slightly down**, indicating that lower rates **helped at the margin but did not trigger a broad-based acceleration**.\n\n**Bottom line (causal summary):**\n\n- Lower interest rates **caused** cheaper borrowing.\n- Cheaper borrowing **caused** moderate increases in business lending and some extra capital spending\u2014especially in selected commercial construction and real estate markets (e.g., Cleveland) and in districts like Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco.\n- However, elevated uncertainty, weak M&A, sectoral headwinds, and prior low-rate lock\u2011ins **caused** many firms and households to hold back, which **caused** loan demand in several districts (New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, parts of San Francisco) to stay flat or fall.\n- As a result, **lower interest rates provided modest, localized support to business activity but did not generate a strong, broad\u2011based increase in production or hiring over the period covered by these reports.**",

[Chicago > Agriculture]\n   - **Financial conditions at the outset:** The report does not provide a separate, dated starting snapshot of bank conditions (for example, no explicit baseline for loan demand or credit availability on a specific August date). However, it establishes that the District entered the period with **no major reported disruptions in banking**, and that the subsequent changes in financial conditions are assessed relative to this late\u2011August starting point.\n\n2. **Developments over the reporting period (late August\u2013September 2025)**\n   During the reporting window, sectoral conditions evolved as follows, providing context for financial conditions:\n\n   - **Consumer sector:**\n     - **Consumer spending increased modestly** over the reporting period. Back\u2011to\u2011school shopping was healthy, and there were strong increases in spending on appliances, computers, and landscaping, even as spending on some other goods (such as certain electronics and building materials) was softer. [Chicago > Consumer Spending; Summary of Economic Activity; National Highlights \u2013 Chicago]\n\n   - **Business spending and investment:**\n     - **Business spending declined slightly in late August and September.** Capital expenditures fell slightly, and expectations for the coming year softened. Demand for truck transportation **edged down**, though freight rates **increased slightly**. This points to a mild weakening in certain cyclical parts of the real economy, particularly in transportation. [Chicago > Business Spending]\n\n   - **Construction and real estate:**\n     - **Construction and real estate activity increased slightly** in the District over the period, according to the national highlights for Chicago. This indicates some ongoing demand for property and construction services despite flat overall economic activity. [National Highlights \u2013 Chicago]\n\n   - **Agriculture and community conditions:**\n     - **Net farm income prospects remained unchanged**, and agricultural operators continued to face **elevated uncertainty**, even as crop conditions were generally good and dry weather was helpful in some areas. [Chicago > Agriculture]\n     - **Community and nonprofit activity did not change**, and state government contacts reported **modest year\u2011over\u2011year gains in sales tax revenues**, consistent with a stable but cautious environment. [Chicago > Community Conditions]\n\n3. **Evolution of financial conditions over the period (late August\u2013September 2025)**\n   - The October 15, 2025 Beige Book entry for Chicago still **does not include a dedicated banking/finance section** describing bank balance sheets, loan growth by type, or detailed credit conditions.\n   - Nonetheless, where it **does** characterize financial conditions explicitly, it reports that over the late\u2011August to September reporting window:\n     - **Overall financial conditions in the Chicago District *loosened slightly*.**\n     - At the same time, **business loan terms *tightened*** over this same period. [BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago District]\n\n   Putting these points together chronologically:\n\n   - From **late August 2025 into September 2025**, as consumer spending was rising modestly, business investment was edging down, and construction/real estate were improving slightly, the **net effect on the District\u2019s financial environment was a slight loosening of overall financial conditions**.\n   - However, **within** that overall loosening, **credit conditions for businesses became somewhat more restrictive**, reflected in **tighter business loan terms**. This suggests that while broader financial markets or household\u2011related financing conditions may have become a bit easier, banks and other lenders **tightened the conditions specifically on business borrowing**.\n\n4. **End of the reporting period (by early October 2025 publication)**\n   - By the time of the **October 15, 2025** Beige Book release (covering information collected through roughly early October), the narrative for the Chicago District was:\n     - **Economic activity: flat overall.**\n     - **Consumer spending: modestly higher.**\n     - **Construction & real estate: slightly higher activity.**\n     - **Employment: flat.**\n     - **Business spending: slightly lower, with softer trucking demand.**\n     - **Agriculture: income prospects unchanged, uncertainty elevated.**\n     - **Community/nonprofit activity: unchanged, modest growth in state tax revenues.**\n     - **Prices and nonlabor input costs: rising moderately, with similar increases expected in the year ahead.**\n     - **Financial conditions: overall *slightly looser* than at the start of the period, but with *tighter terms on business loans*.** [BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago District; National Highlights \u2013 Chicago]\n\nIn summary, **over the late\u2011August to September 2025 reporting period**, the Chicago District saw **slightly looser overall financial conditions**, even as **credit terms for business borrowers tightened**. This occurred against a backdrop of **flat overall activity**, modest gains in consumer spending and construction, slightly weaker business spending (including trucking), stable agricultural income prospects, and moderately rising prices.",

[BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - San Francisco (Twelfth District): conditions \u201cweakened slightly.\u201d [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Ninth and Tenth Districts also reported weakening or weak farm conditions, which modestly weighed on their local economies, especially for crop producers.

[BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Dallas District: favorable growing conditions and strong yields, but financial returns were pressured. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nProduction and yields\n- Production outcomes were mixed:\n  - Some row crops such as cotton and grains had strong yields in regions like the Dallas District. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Labor shortages in the Twelfth District reduced harvest volumes despite otherwise favorable conditions. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Livestock, particularly cattle in the Tenth District, performed \u201cconsiderably better\u201d than crop operations. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nPrices, costs, and profitability\n- Grain and cotton prices were often below profitable levels (\u201csub\u2011profitable\u201d), putting financial pressure on farmers. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Rising input costs further squeezed margins, including higher costs for packaging materials.

[BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nLabor and demand conditions\n- Labor: Multiple Districts, including St. Louis and San Francisco, reported agricultural labor shortages that affected harvesting and operations. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Demand: Export demand, particularly sales to China, declined due to trade policy changes, contributing to weaker overall activity. At least one contact anticipated that lower sales volumes would constrain investment in future planting seasons. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nIn sum, the agriculture sector was characterized by generally down or strained activity, weak profitability for many crop producers due to sub\u2011profitable grain and cotton prices and higher costs, regionally mixed production outcomes, ongoing labor shortages, and softer demand\u2014especially from overseas\u2014partially offset by better performance in livestock (notably cattle) and by government support programs.
