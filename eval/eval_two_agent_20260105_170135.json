      "expected": "The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco prepared the October 2025 Beige Book report.",
      "answer": "## Direct Answer  \nBased on the available evidence, I cannot answer which specific Federal Reserve Bank prepared the October 2025 Beige Book report because none of the provided chunks identify a particular Reserve Bank (e.g., Atlanta, Cleveland, etc.) as the preparer. The evidence confirms the report is the \u201cOctober2025\u201d Beige Book and that it is a Federal Reserve System publication, but it does not name the preparing Bank. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 44fb2a38-1783-4dd7-b97f-7eef0bc49d83]\n\n## Supporting Evidence  \n- The header confirms the document is the \u201cBeige Book \u2026 October2025\u201d and labels it as \u201cFEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM,\u201d without attributing preparation to any single Reserve Bank. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 44fb2a38-1783-4dd7-b97f-7eef0bc49d83]  \n- Background text states the Beige Book is a \u201cFederal Reserve System publication\u201d describing conditions across the 12 Districts, with information \u201cgathered directly from each District\u2019s sources,\u201d but it does not specify which Reserve Bank prepared this specific October 2025 edition. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 63c7314f-6181-4511-b574-fddd10b0de9b]  \n- The collection process notes that \u201cEach Federal Reserve Bank gathers information on current economic conditions in its District,\u201d indicating distributed input rather than identifying a single preparer for the October 2025 report. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 100b6fe2-0070-4072-9250-26a928a8ad92]\n\n## Caveats  \n- No evidence chunk explicitly states \u201cPrepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of X\u201d (or similar attribution) for the October 2025 Beige Book. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 44fb2a38-1783-4dd7-b97f-7eef0bc49d83]  \n- The evidence describes how information is collected and that the Beige Book is a Fed System publication, but it does not include the preparation/compilation credit line needed to answer the question. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 63c7314f-6181-4511-b574-fddd10b0de9b; DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 100b6fe2-0070-4072-9250-26a928a8ad92]\n\n## Confidence  \nLow. The evidence does not contain the specific attribution required to identify which Federal Reserve Bank prepared the October 2025 Beige Book. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 44fb2a38-1783-4dd7-b97f-7eef0bc49d83]",
