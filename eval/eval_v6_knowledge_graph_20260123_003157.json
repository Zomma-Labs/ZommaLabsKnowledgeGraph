Decrease is within that range.\n- Additional detail about other sectors (commercial real estate, manufacturing, lending, etc.) is not in conflict with the expected answer and does not introduce factual contradictions relative to it.\n\nNo contradictions with the expected answer; all key points are covered, and extra details are consistent.
