[Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Manufacturing, 2026-01-09]  \n- **Supporting excerpt:** \u201cSeveral manufacturers continued to attribute flat or weaker orders to **import tariffs and persistent uncertainty about trade policy**.\u201d [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Manufacturing, 2026-01-09]\n\n### 2) Boston District \u2014 **General elevated uncertainty + tariff-related cost pressures**\n- **Factor cited (uncertainty channel):** Firms kept head counts steady \u201cbecause of uncertainty,\u201d and hiring plans were limited due to \u201celevated uncertainty.\u201d [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Labor Markets, 2026-01-09]  \n  - **Supporting excerpts:** \u201csome kept head counts steady **because of uncertainty**\u201d and \u201chiring plans remained limited, owing to rising cost pressures and **elevated uncertainty**.\u201d [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Labor Markets, 2026-01-09]  \n- **Factor cited (policy/cost channel tied to tariffs):** A firm \u201cshed workers to offset tariff-related cost increases,\u201d indicating tariffs were a disruptive cost factor mentioned alongside uncertainty in the same labor-market narrative. [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Labor Markets, 2026-01-09]  \n  - **Supporting excerpt:** \u201cone shed workers to offset **tariff-related cost increases**.\u201d [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Labor Markets, 2026-01-09]\n\n> The excerpt does not explicitly state that tariffs *caused* \u201cuncertainty,\u201d but it does directly link tariffs to cost increases and labor actions in the same passage where \u201cuncertainty\u201d and \u201celevated uncertainty\u201d are explicitly described as constraining hiring. [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Labor Markets, 2026-01-09]\n\n### 3) Minneapolis District \u2014 **Market uncertainty affecting hiring decisions**\n- **Factor cited:** \u201cUncertainty in the market\u201d led employers (via a staffing contact) to shift from direct hiring toward temp and temp-to-hire work. [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis > Labor Markets, 2026-01-09]  \n- **Supporting excerpt:** \u201cthe uncertainty in the market has spurred more temp and temp-to-hire work\u2026 rather than direct hiring.\u201d [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis > Labor Markets, 2026-01-09]\n\n> The excerpt does not specify the root cause of the market uncertainty (e.g., trade policy, rates, geopolitics); it only documents the existence of \u201cuncertainty in the market\u201d and its hiring impact. [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis > Labor Markets, 2026-01-09]\n\n### 4) Philadelphia District \u2014 **Heightened economic uncertainty (factor not specified)**\n- **Factor cited:** The District summary reports \u201cheightened economic uncertainty remains,\u201d but does not identify the specific drivers in the provided excerpt. [Source: National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Philadelphia, 2026-01-09]  \n- **Supporting excerpt:** \u201cGenerally, firms expect modest growth over the next six months, but **heightened economic uncertainty remains**.\u201d [Source: National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Philadelphia, 2026-01-09]\n\n---\n\n## Cross-district synthesis (common vs. district-specific factors; limited to provided evidence)\n- **Common / recurring factor in the evidence:**  \n  - **Trade policy/tariffs-related uncertainty or impacts** appear in multiple districts: Cleveland explicitly ties weaker orders to \u201cimport tariffs\u201d and \u201cpersistent uncertainty about trade policy,\u201d while Boston notes \u201ctariff-related cost increases\u201d alongside explicit mentions of uncertainty constraining hiring. [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Manufacturing, 2026-01-09; Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Labor Markets, 2026-01-09]\n- **District-specific (as supported in the excerpts):**  \n  - **Minneapolis:** \u201cuncertainty in the market\u201d is specifically evidenced as changing hiring composition toward temp work, without identifying a policy or macro driver. [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis > Labor Markets, 2026-01-09]  \n  - **Philadelphia:** \u201cheightened economic uncertainty\u201d is reported, but the excerpt provides no causal factors. [Source: National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Philadelphia, 2026-01-09]\n\n---\n\n## Important completeness note\n- The Beige Book covers **12 Federal Reserve Districts**, but the provided evidence includes uncertainty-related language for only **Boston, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia**, and does not provide uncertainty drivers for Philadelphia beyond the statement that uncertainty remains. As a result, the factor list is **exhaustive only within the supplied excerpts**, not necessarily exhaustive for the full Beige Book edition.
