      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "answer": "The available findings give only a partial picture and do not support a definitive overall assessment of how economic activity changed in the Twelfth District.\n\n1. **Overall economic activity (district-wide):**  \n   - One review explicitly reports that no evidence was collected on recent changes in overall economic activity in the Twelfth District, so no definitive conclusion can be drawn at that level.  \n   - Source: Finding 1 (stating \u201cNo evidence was collected\u201d and \u201cNo definitive conclusions can be drawn\u201d).\n\n2. **Labor market, wages, and prices:**  \n   - Another review similarly found no collected evidence on labor market conditions, wages, or prices in the Twelfth District, so changes in these areas cannot be characterized.  \n   - Source: Finding 2 (stating \u201cNo reliable findings\u2026 due to the absence of any collected evidence\u201d).\n\n3. **Sectoral performance (where some evidence exists):**  \n   - The Twelfth District economy is described as having **moderate but uneven sectoral performance**.  \n   - **Services and consumer spending:** Evidence indicates **continued expansion in the services sector** and **consumer spending that is supportive**, contributing to **moderate economic activity**.  \n   - **Manufacturing:** Manufacturing shows **mixed signals**, with some segments experiencing **slowdowns**, possibly related to supply chain and demand fluctuations.  \n   - **Housing:** The **housing market is experiencing challenges**, with **slower performance**, likely linked to interest rates and affordability constraints.  \n   - **Technology:** The **technology sector\u2019s performance** is reported as being **largely tied to broader economic trends and venture capital activity**, without a separate quantified trend.  \n   - **Outlook:** Projections suggest **continued but potentially decelerating growth**, reflecting the uneven performance across sectors.  \n   - Source: Finding 3 (all sectoral characterizations and outlook).\n\n**Synthesis:**  \nBased on the sectoral evidence, economic activity in the Twelfth District appears to be growing at a **moderate but potentially slowing** pace, driven by resilience in **services and consumer spending**, while **manufacturing and housing** act as **drags**. However, because no evidence was collected on overall activity metrics or on labor, wages, and prices (Findings 1 and 2), the change in economic activity can only be described in this **partial, sector-specific** way, not as a fully documented district-wide trend.",

They state explicitly that no evidence was collected regarding its definition, purpose, contents, frequency, or structure.  \n\nBecause of this lack of evidence, the findings do not allow any description or characterization of the Beige Book beyond noting that the research objective was to define and explain it, but that objective was not met.",

They indicate that no evidence from that report was collected or analyzed, either at the national level or for individual districts.\n\nBecause of this lack of source material, the findings do not specify how overall economic activity changed according to the October 2025 Beige Book, and no conclusion can be drawn from the available research.",

      "answer": "Manufacturing demand in the Chicago Federal Reserve District was driven primarily by sector\u2011specific dynamics and weakening macroeconomic conditions:\n\n1. **Auto sector weakness as the main direct driver (late August\u2013September)**  \n   The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago reported that:\n   * \u201cManufacturing demand declined modestly in late August and September.\u201d  \n   * \u201cMachinery orders decreased moderately, driven by a decline in demand from the auto sector.\u201d  \n   * \u201cAuto production was down modestly, while heavy truck production was flat.\u201d  \n   * Steel orders were \u201cflat overall,\u201d and fabricated metals demand was \u201cunchanged on balance,\u201d as higher sales to a range of sectors were offset by lower sales to the **construction and automotive industries**.  \n    \n   Together, these indicate that reduced demand from the **automotive industry** (and to a lesser extent construction) was a key driver of the modest overall decline in manufacturing demand in the District in that period.  \n   [Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Manufacturing, late August\u2013September]\n\n2. **Macroeconomic and policy factors dampening demand (recent period, not date\u2011specified)**  \n   Separate findings on the Chicago District identify broader forces that have been negatively affecting manufacturing demand:\n   * **Economic uncertainty and inflation** are cited as key influences on demand, with inflation and associated **interest rate hikes** contributing to higher borrowing costs and a dampening of economic activity.  \n   * **Slowing consumer spending and weaker consumer confidence** are linked directly to reduced orders for manufactured goods as households become more cautious.  \n   * Discussions of the **economic outlook** and \u201crecession\u201d as relevant topics indicate expectations of broader economic slowdown, which \u201cdirectly translates to diminished demand for manufacturing output.\u201d  \n   * Feedback from \u201cSeptember Survey\u201d **manufacturing contacts** in the District indicates a \u201cweakening demand environment\u201d and expectations of further declines.  \n\n   These findings attribute contracting manufacturing demand in the Chicago District to **rising economic uncertainty, persistent inflation, tighter monetary policy, and slowing consumer spending**, with manufacturers anticipating continued weakness.  \n   [Source: topics on Demand, Economic Outlook, Economic Uncertainty, Inflation, Consumer Spending, Consumer Confidence, September Survey; Chicago District manufacturing contacts]\n\n3. **Other purported drivers (wage growth, labor market, economic outlook) lack direct, District\u2011specific evidence**  \n   Another summary states that within the Chicago District, **wage growth**, the **economic outlook**, and the **labor market** significantly influence manufacturing demand, asserting that:\n   * Positive wage growth increases disposable income and thus demand for manufactured goods.  \n   * An optimistic economic outlook supports business investment and demand.  \n   * A robust labor market supports manufacturing operations, while labor market weakness can dampen demand.  \n\n   However, this summary does not provide direct Chicago Fed textual evidence tying these factors specifically and causally to manufacturing demand in the Chicago District; it only lists them as relevant topics (Wage Growth, Economic Outlook, Labor Market, etc.). As such, the strength and specificity of these claims for the Chicago District cannot be verified beyond that high\u2011level association.  \n   [Source: topic resolution for \u201cmanufacturing demand Chicago District sector-specific factors\u201d]\n\n**Most concrete, directly supported drivers:**  \nFrom the explicit Chicago Fed manufacturing text, the clearest identified drivers of manufacturing demand in the Chicago District are:\n\n- A **modest overall decline in manufacturing demand** in late August and September;  \n- **Reduced demand from the automotive sector**, which:\n  - Directly lowered **machinery orders**, and  \n  - Contributed, along with construction, to flat/unchanged demand in **fabricated metals**;  \n- A broader environment of **economic uncertainty, inflation, higher interest rates, and slowing consumer spending and confidence**, as reported in topic\u2011based findings and manufacturer surveys, which has been **contracting overall manufacturing demand** and leading firms to expect further weakness.",

      "reasoning": "The expected answer is a specific summary of late August\u2013September Chicago District manufacturing conditions: modest decline in overall demand; flat steel orders; fabricated metals unchanged on balance with higher sales offset by lower construction/auto; machinery orders down moderately due to weaker auto-sector demand; auto production down modestly and heavy truck production flat. The agent reproduces most of these key points accurately and identifies auto-sector weakness as the main driver, consistent with the expected answer. However, the agent adds additional macroeconomic/policy drivers (inflation, interest rates, consumer confidence, recession expectations) that are not part of the expected answer and are not supported by the provided expected text.

This improves **credit conditions**, making it easier and cheaper for businesses to finance **business investment** and **business expansion** [Finding 3].  \n   - The topics resolved (\u201cInterest Rates,\u201d \u201cBusiness Investment,\u201d \u201cBank Lending,\u201d \u201cDebt Financing,\u201d \u201cCredit Conditions,\u201d \u201cBusiness Expansion\u201d) support the link that cheaper borrowing costs under lower interest rates are associated with higher investment and expansion by firms [Finding 3].\n\n2. **Creating longer\u2011term distortions and weaker productivity under persistently low rates**  \n   - Persistently low interest rates are found to encourage **\u201creach for yield\u201d** behavior and support the survival of **\u201czombie firms\u201d**, with a confidence level of 0.85 [Finding 4].  \n   - Lower borrowing costs allow financially weak or unproductive firms (\u201czombie firms\u201d) to stay solvent, which **diverts capital and resources away from more efficient businesses** [Finding 4; topics: \u201czombie firms under low interest rates,\u201d \u201czombie firms,\u201d \u201cBank Lending,\u201d \u201cBankruptcy,\u201d \u201cSolvency\u201d].  \n   - At the same time, the low-rate environment leads investors and businesses to **take on greater risk** in search of higher returns (\u201creach for yield\u201d), including investing in **riskier assets** or extending credit to **less creditworthy borrowers** [Finding 4; topics: \u201creach for yield under low interest rates,\u201d \u201creach for yield,\u201d \u201cCredit Quality,\u201d \u201cDebt Financing,\u201d \u201cBank Lending,\u201d \u201cLiquidity\u201d].  \n   - These behaviors result in a **misallocation of capital**\u2014capital being allocated to less productive uses\u2014linked to weaker **operational efficiency**, **business investment quality**, and potentially **GDP growth** [Finding 4; topics: \u201cmisallocation of capital,\u201d \u201cBusiness Investment,\u201d \u201cOperational Efficiency,\u201d \u201cGDP\u201d].  \n   - This misallocation and the continued existence of less productive firms are directly associated with **suppressed productivity growth** in the broader economy [Finding 4; topics: \u201cproductivity and interest rates,\u201d \u201cGDP,\u201d \u201cEconomic Activity\u201d].\n\nAdditional constraints from the findings:\n\n- The **specific transmission mechanisms** from policy rate cuts to business activity beyond these sectoral links are labeled as **unknown** because no detailed evidence was collected on them [Finding 1].  \n- Likewise, the **quantitative impact** of post\u20112008 low interest rates on overall business investment and output in major advanced economies remains **unquantified** in the collected evidence [Finding 2].\n\nPutting this together:  \nBased on the available evidence, lower interest rates are associated with **higher business investment and expansion via increased bank lending and easier debt financing in the short to medium term** [Finding 3].

The relationship is that AI adoption in employment contexts coincides with **task substitution and workforce reductions**, affecting **who is employed and in what numbers**, but the mechanics of AI-based selection or promotion are not detailed in the evidence provided.\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis**\n\nAcross the documented evidence (primarily as of 2025-10-15), artificial intelligence affected employment decisions mainly by:\n\n- **Driving layoffs and employment reductions** that were explicitly **paired with increased investment in AI**, particularly in certain sectors like professional services.\n- **Substituting for tasks and positions**, especially those held by **less experienced employees**, thereby influencing which categories of workers were retained or displaced.\n- **Altering skill requirements**, strengthening demand and wage pressures for **highly specialized positions**, while AI took over more routine or lower-experience tasks.\n- **Reshaping workforce management** through AI-based scheduling and algorithmic management tools, which influenced decisions about workforce levels and how labor was allocated.\n\nThe findings do not provide quantified net job effects, detailed case studies of individual firms, or specific descriptions of AI\u2019s role in individual hiring or promotion decisions; they only show that AI adoption is associated with **employment reductions, changes in task allocation, and shifts in the skills and experience levels favored in employment decisions.**",

While this is a different sector, it indicates that tariff-related cost pressures were present in the regional economy alongside falling farm-gate prices, contributing to a **squeeze on agriculture** (lower output prices for farmers amid broader tariff-related price adjustments).\n\n- **St. Louis Fed (Eighth District \u2013 sector conditions)**  \n  - The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis **\u201creported strained and further deteriorated conditions in agriculture\u201d** and **explicitly attributed this deterioration to agriculture** in a context that includes trade impacts.  \n  - The St. Louis district\u2019s **Summary of Economic Activity** characterized agriculture as **strained** and **deteriorating**, indicating that trade-related issues were contributing to **worsening financial and operating conditions for farms** in that district.\n\n- **Other district-level indications tied to trade and tariffs**  \n  - Across **federal reserve districts**, **tariffs were reported**, and these were associated with **changes in cost structures** that were **passed through to final prices** to varying extents. This suggests that, beyond the Minneapolis and St. Louis districts where agriculture-specific detail is given, **agricultural producers in multiple districts were affected through price and cost channels linked to tariffs**.  \n  - Contacts in agriculture (as summarized at the Beige Book level) **remarked on the impact** of these trade-related developments, and agriculture was described as having **depressed conditions within overall economic activity**, reinforcing that **trade concerns were a notable headwind for the sector**.\n\n- **China-specific trade concerns (Beige Book agriculture contacts)**  \n  - Agricultural contacts were reported to be **concerned about the elimination of China as a notable component of foreign demand**, and it was reported that China was **eliminated as a market** in this context.  \n  - This elimination of China as an agricultural export destination was described as having **depressed market conditions within soybeans**, indicating that in districts heavily involved in soybean production, **loss of Chinese demand due to trade issues directly contributed to weaker prices and depressed market conditions**.\n\nIn summary, the findings indicate that **trade-related concerns\u2014particularly tariffs and the loss of China as an export market\u2014contributed to weaker agricultural conditions across multiple Federal Reserve districts**. The effects reported include:\n\n- **Depressed market conditions and lower prices** for key commodities (especially soybeans, but also wheat, dairy, livestock, and other crops) across districts in Beige Book reporting.  \n- **District-specific evidence** from Minneapolis showing **broad-based price declines** across many agricultural products, coinciding with tariff-related price adjustments in the regional economy.  \n- **Strained and deteriorating agricultural conditions** in the St. Louis district, linked to the same broad context of trade-related pressures.  \n\nThe available evidence does not provide a full district-by-district breakdown, but it consistently ties **tariffs and trade disruptions** to **depressed prices, flat revenues, and deteriorating conditions in agriculture** across multiple Federal Reserve districts.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer highlights (1) Minneapolis agricultural contacts specifically concerned about China\u2019s elimination of soybean purchases, (2) St. Louis agriculture strained and further deteriorated with pessimistic outlook, and (3) agriculture generally down across districts with trade uncertainty adding to challenges. The agent captures the Minneapolis China/soybean demand loss point (though phrased more generally) and correctly notes St. Louis strained/deteriorating conditions, and it also conveys that trade/tariff uncertainty was a headwind broadly. However, it adds a lot of extra claims (flat revenues, pass-through to final prices, detailed commodity price lists, manufacturing tariff effects) that are not part of the expected key facts and may not be supported as stated. Also, it does not clearly state the \u201coverall pessimistic outlook\u201d in St. Louis and somewhat muddies the Minneapolis point by focusing on general price declines rather than the specific concern about China ending soybean purchases.",

In the Cleveland District, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to uncertainty around federal grants. In the Boston District, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health-care sectors.",
      "answer": "Federal policy changes affected nonprofits across multiple districts in several distinct ways, with COVID-era relief policies providing the clearest, evidence-based impacts; other policy areas are identified but not documented in detail in the findings.\n\n1. **COVID-era federal relief policies (most clearly documented impact)**  \n   - According to Finding 2, major federal COVID relief measures had **significant but regionally varied effects** on nonprofits\u2019:\n     - **Social service delivery capacity:** Relief policies \u201cdemonstrably supported the continued or expanded delivery of social services by nonprofits,\u201d helping them maintain or increase services during the pandemic. This effect is described as consistent across discussions but with variation in how it manifested by district.\n     - **Workforce stability:** Some nonprofits experienced **workforce reductions early in the pandemic**, but federal relief \u201clikely mitigated more severe losses\u201d and in some cases contributed to **wage growth**, due to increased service demand and a tighter labor market. The degree of workforce stabilization and wage effects varied across districts.\n     - **Financial health (net income and revenue):** Relief funds served as a **financial buffer**, \u201cpositively impacting nonprofit net income and revenue by offsetting lost fundraising opportunities and increased operational costs.\u201d The extent of this buffer differed by region, influenced by local economic conditions and nonprofit landscapes.\n     - **Economic outlook and planning:** By directly addressing **economic uncertainty**, relief policies shaped nonprofits\u2019 **economic outlook and operational planning**, though the specific outlook varied across Federal Reserve Districts.\n\n   - Finding 2 explicitly notes that \u201cthe specific nature and magnitude of these impacts\u201d differed by Federal Reserve District, \u201clikely influenced by regional economic conditions and the pre-existing landscape of nonprofit organizations,\u201d but it does not provide district-by-district detail.\n\n2. **Other recent federal policy changes (beyond COVID relief)**  \n   - Finding 4 indicates that nonprofits\u2019 experiences **differ across regions and districts** in responding to \u201crecent federal policy changes,\u201d with variation driven by the **type of policy** and **nonprofit sector**:\n     - **Fiscal policy, social services, and health care policies:** Changes in these areas \u201cdirectly impact nonprofit funding streams and the demand for their services.\u201d Because federal funds are often distributed through state or local entities, **implementation and impact differ regionally**, leading to distinct experiences across districts in terms of **financial stability** and **operational scope**.  \n       - Specific policies, magnitudes, or named districts are not identified in the findings.\n     - **Monetary policy and macroeconomic shifts (e.g., quantitative tightening, wage growth, workforce reduction):** These affect nonprofits **indirectly**, by shaping the broader economic environment\u2014altering **borrowing costs** and **labor market conditions** (recruitment, retention, wage pressures). The findings state that these effects on nonprofits **vary across districts**, but do not quantify or specify district-level differences.\n     - **Campaign finance, corporate governance, and executive leadership context:** Finding 4 notes these broader policy and governance topics can influence **donation patterns**, the **regulatory/ethical environment**, and **strategic decisions** by nonprofit leaders. These impacts are described as **nuanced and regionally varied**, depending on local political and economic climates, but no concrete examples by district are provided.\n\n3. **Areas where findings are inconclusive or absent**  \n   - Finding 1 and Finding 3 explicitly report **no evidence collected** on:\n     - Specific **non-COVID federal policies** (e.g., detailed tax code changes, unrelated business income tax, specific grant program shifts) and their measured effects on nonprofits.\n     - Direct, quantified effects of **federal tax and regulatory changes** on nonprofit finances and operations.\n   - As a result, beyond the COVID-era relief and the broad categorizations in Finding 4, the findings do **not** specify:\n     - Exact federal statutes or regulations,\n     - Which particular Federal Reserve Districts experienced which precise effects,\n     - Sector-specific outcomes beyond general references to social services and health care.\n\n**Synthesis:**  \nBased on the available findings, the clearest documented pattern is that **federal COVID-era relief policies** materially supported nonprofits\u2019 **service capacity, workforce stability, and financial health**, with **meaningful variation across Federal Reserve Districts** shaped by local economic and nonprofit conditions. Beyond COVID relief, federal fiscal, social-service, health, and monetary policy changes are reported to influence nonprofits\u2019 **funding, demand for services, borrowing costs, and labor markets**, again in **regionally varied ways**, but the findings do not provide policy-specific or district-specific quantitative detail.",

Additionally, some contacts in the Chicago District reported moderate increases in nonlabor costs including energy and higher prices for raw materials. This meant total compensation costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.",
      "answer": "Multiple factors affected labor costs, and the findings describe how each interacted with wage growth in the recent period covered (around 2025\u201110\u201115):\n\n1. **Wage growth itself (primary driver of labor costs)**  \n   * Labor costs were \u201cprimarily determined by wage growth\u201d and by the state of the labor market and cost structure [Finding 1].  \n   * Wage growth is directly tied to labor costs through its intensifying effect on firms\u2019 **cost structures**: cost structures \u201cwere intensified in part due to outsized increases\u201d in wage growth and \u201cintensified in recent weeks due to outsized increases\u201d in wage growth [Cost Structure edges; Finding 1, Finding 2].  \n   * At the same time, **wage growth pressures were easing**: wage growth was described as \u201cmodest,\u201d at \u201cpre\u2011pandemic rates,\u201d with \u201cwage pressures continu[ing] to ease\u201d and \u201cwage inflation continu[ing] to ease\u201d [Finding 2]. Thus, although wage growth had previously pushed labor costs up, by the time of the reports it was no longer accelerating strongly.\n\n2. **Labor market conditions (unemployment, employment, and easing/tightness)**  \n   * The **labor market** is identified as a key determinant of labor costs: \u201cLabor costs are primarily determined by wage growth, significantly influenced by the dynamics of the labor market (including unemployment and employment levels)\u201d [Finding 1].  \n   * Wage growth interacted with labor market conditions in two directions:\n     * Wage pressures \u201cpersisted for\u201d the labor market but \u201ccontinued to ease in the context of\u201d the labor market [Labor Market\u2013Wage Growth edges; Finding 2].  \n     * The \u201cwaning\u201d of labor market pressures \u201ccontributed to keeping\u201d wage growth contained [Labor Market\u2013Wage Growth edge, 2025\u201110\u201115; Finding 2].  \n   * **Low unemployment** and labor market tightness had earlier created wage pressures, but small upticks in unemployment were cited by banks as a source of economic uncertainty [Unemployment edges; Findings 1 and 2], which, together with easing conditions, aligned with the observation that wage growth had become modest and was easing.\n\n3. **Cost structure (overall cost base of firms, including labor)**  \n   * Labor costs are described as a \u201csignificant component of the overall cost structure,\u201d with cost structures \u201creported to be up modestly\u201d in the context of the labor market [Finding 1].  \n   * Wage growth feeds directly into this: cost structures \u201cwere intensified in part due to outsized increases\u201d in wage growth and \u201cintensified in recent weeks due to outsized increases\u201d in wage growth [Cost Structure\u2013Wage Growth edges; Findings 1 and 2].  \n   * Cost structures also \u201chad change described as rising moderately similar to inflation\u201d [Cost Structure\u2013Inflation edge, 2025\u201110\u201115; Findings 1 and 2], indicating that as wages and other costs rose, they moved broadly in line with inflation. This links wage growth, labor costs, and general price dynamics.\n\n4. **Economic activity (demand conditions)**  \n   * Declining **economic activity** \u201creduced labor market\u201d demand and \u201ccaused in some cases workforce reduction\u201d [Economic Activity edges; Finding 1], which indirectly affects labor costs by easing hiring needs and weakening upward wage pressure.  \n   * Contacts \u201creported a decline in\u201d economic activity, and \u201cslightly softer\u201d economic activity was \u201ccited as contributing to modest right\u2011sizing\u201d of workforces [Economic Activity edges; Finding 1].  \n   * In this environment, wage growth remained modest and wage pressures eased [Finding 2], showing that weaker demand and right\u2011sizing of staff contributed to slower wage growth and helped contain labor cost acceleration.\n\n5. **Workforce reduction (employment cuts or right\u2011sizing)**  \n   * **Workforce reduction** is linked both to cost structure and economic activity: economic activity that \u201cdeclined\u2026 caused in some cases workforce reduction,\u201d and workforce reduction \u201cincreased\u201d cost structure [Economic Activity\u2013Workforce Reduction and Cost Structure\u2013Workforce Reduction edges; Finding 1].  \n   * The findings indicate that firms sometimes responded to slowing demand by \u201creduc[ing] to right size labor due to slowing demand\u201d [Labor Market\u2013Workforce Reduction edge; Finding 1].  \n   * This adjustment in headcount interacts with wage growth by reducing overall labor demand, which aligns with observed easing wage pressures and modest wage growth.\n\n6. **Inflation (and its connection to wages and labor costs)**  \n   * Inflation \u201cincreased and contributed to higher prices\u201d and had a change \u201cdescribed as rising moderately similar to\u201d cost structure [Inflation\u2013Cost Structure edge; Findings 1 and 2].  \n   * Rising labor costs (driven by wage growth) are part of this cost structure, and there is a feedback noted in the research: rising labor costs can contribute to inflation, and inflation in turn is associated with rising cost structures [Finding 1].  \n   * Wage growth is characterized as modest and easing, while inflation remained elevated in some districts [Inflation edges; Finding 2], suggesting that wage growth was not accelerating in a way that would intensify a wage\u2011price spiral in this period, but still fed into cost increases observed as \u201crising moderately.\u201d\n\n7. **Pricing power (ability to pass higher labor costs into prices)**  \n   * Higher labor costs and broader cost structure pressures interacted with **pricing power**. Some firms experienced \u201cpushback from customers that constrains their pricing power,\u201d leading them to keep prices \u201clargely unchanged despite higher costs\u201d [Pricing Power edges; Finding 2].  \n   * Pricing power \u201cwas constrained for some contacts amid declining demand\u201d [Pricing Power\u2013Contacts edge; Finding 2].  \n   * This interaction means that even when wage growth raises labor costs, firms could not always fully pass these costs on to customers, so higher wage costs squeezed margins rather than causing proportional price increases. This, in turn, may feed back into wage growth: with profitability constrained, some firms \u201cheld [wage growth] steady due to lack of profitability\u201d [Wage Growth\u2013Manufacturers edge; Finding 1], limiting further wage increases.\n\n8. **Operational efficiency and productivity**  \n   * **Operational efficiency** (linked to productivity) affects how labor costs translate into overall business costs. It \u201cincreased within manufacturing\u201d and was associated with robotics and automation [Operational Efficiency edges; Finding 1].  \n   * Productivity improvements can \u201cinfluence how labor costs are managed or perceived,\u201d especially during economic uncertainty [Finding 1], and research on \u201cproductivity and wages relationship\u201d indicates a direct link between productivity, wage growth, and economic activity [Finding 3].  \n   * The findings note that higher productivity can help \u201cmitigate or offset rising labor costs\u201d and is a primary factor influencing both labor costs and wages [Finding 3]. Thus, even when nominal wages rise, improved productivity can keep unit labor costs from rising as quickly. This is consistent with the observation that cost structures were \u201cup modestly\u201d and \u201crising moderately,\u201d despite previous outsized wage increases.\n\n9. **Labor relations (unions, bargaining) and taxation (payroll-related costs)**  \n   * **Labor relations** are mentioned as a factor that \u201calso play[s] a role\u201d in labor costs, though not as a primary driver in the evidence [Finding 1]. Labor relations \u201cwere reported to affect\u201d certain sectors (e.g., health care providers & services) [Labor Relations edges; Finding 1], suggesting that bargaining, disputes, or institutional frameworks can influence wage outcomes in specific contexts.  \n   * **Taxation** is directly linked to firms\u2019 cost structures: taxation \u201cincreased cost structure\u201d and was reported as \u201cincreased cost of doing business\u201d [Taxation\u2013Cost Structure edges; Finding 1]. While the findings do not specify a direct quantitative link between taxation and wage growth, higher non-wage labor costs (like taxes) add to total labor costs. In turn, constrained profitability (partly due to such costs) is noted as a reason some manufacturers held wage growth steady [Wage Growth\u2013Manufacturers edge; Finding 1], indicating an indirect interaction.\n\n10. **Economic uncertainty and institutional/global context**  \n   * **Economic uncertainty** is frequently cited: operational efficiency was \u201cmoderately or significantly constrained by uncertainty\u201d [Operational Efficiency\u2013Economic Uncertainty edges; Finding 1], and unemployment was cited as contributing to economic uncertainty [Unemployment edges; Finding 2]. This uncertainty influences hiring, investment, and willingness to raise wages.  \n   * The research notes that institutions and globalization are present as contextual influences on wage growth but not explicitly detailed in the evidence; they are inferred as part of the broader environment shaping \u201cmodest\u201d and \u201cmoderate\u201d wage growth within the labor market [Finding 4].  \n   * Overall, this environment of uncertainty and modest demand is consistent with wage pressures that \u201ccontinued to ease\u201d and wage growth that remained modest [Finding 2], thereby tempering the rise in labor costs.\n\n**Synthesis of interactions with wage growth**\n\nAcross the findings, the interaction can be summarized as follows (within the 2025\u201110\u201115 context):\n\n- Earlier **outsized increases in wage growth** had already intensified labor-related cost structures, contributing to higher labor costs.  \n- As **economic activity softened**, **labor market conditions eased**, and **workforces were right\u2011sized**, **wage pressures continued to ease** and wage growth settled at modest, pre\u2011pandemic rates.  \n- Even with moderate inflation and higher overall cost structures, constrained **pricing power** and **profitability** limited firms\u2019 ability or willingness to grant further wage increases, reinforcing the easing of wage growth.  \n- **Productivity/operational efficiency gains** helped offset some of the impact of prior wage increases on unit labor costs.  \n- **Taxation** and **labor relations** added to cost structures and could influence wage setting at the margin, but the dominant pattern in the findings is that easing labor market tightness and softer demand led to modest, easing wage growth, which in turn reduced the pace at which labor costs were rising.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says wage growth was modest to moderate, but labor cost pressures intensified mainly because employer-sponsored health insurance costs rose sharply, and (in Chicago) some nonlabor inputs like energy and raw materials increased\u2014so total compensation rose faster than wages alone.

However, it does describe how overall consumer spending patterns affected the broader \u201crestaurants and food services\u201d category:\n\n1. **Overall consumer spending context in the Chicago District**  \n   - Consumer spending in the Chicago Federal Reserve District showed **robust growth in the services sector**, and food services are included within this broader services category [Finding 1].  \n   - More generally, consumer spending **increased modestly over the period** referenced, indicating a supportive backdrop for services, including restaurants [Finding 2].\n\n2. **Impact on restaurants and food services (as a combined segment)**  \n   - Reports from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago indicate that consumer spending in **\u201cHotels, Restaurants & Leisure\u201d increased**, with specific mentions of **increased restaurant spending** and **solid demand** from this category [Finding 2].  \n   - At the same time, other reports from the same source note that **consumer spending declined somewhat** and that **sales in this category were mixed**, with some contacts reporting **softness in spending** in \u201cHotels, Restaurants & Leisure\u201d [Finding 2].  \n\n   Together, this indicates that consumer spending patterns produced **mixed performance** in the restaurant\u2011related category: periods or sub\u2011areas of **increased restaurant spending and solid demand**, alongside reports of **soft or declining spending and mixed sales**.\n\n3. **Differences across restaurant segments**  \n   - The findings do **not** provide segment\u2011level detail (e.g., quick\u2011service vs. full\u2011service vs. fine dining) for the Chicago District.  \n   - The only segmentation identified in the evidence is the broader combined category **\u201cHotels, Restaurants & Leisure,\u201d** and this category as a whole experienced both **strength (increased spending, solid demand)** and **weakness (softness, mixed sales)** over the reported period [Finding 2].  \n   - No evidence was found on **post\u2011pandemic shifts by restaurant format** in the Midwest/Chicago area [Finding 4].\n\n**In summary:**  \nWithin the Chicago Federal Reserve District, consumer spending on services was generally strong, and this supported restaurant and broader \u201cHotels, Restaurants & Leisure\u201d activity. However, Fed Beige Book\u2013style reports describe **mixed conditions**: some indications of **increased restaurant spending and solid demand**, alongside reports of **softness and mixed sales** in the same broad category.

Within that constraint, the following points can be stated:\n\n1. **No documented causal estimates from the literature**  \n   - Finding 3 explicitly states that, within the scope of the research conducted there, *\u201cthere is no established causal impact of federal government spending on industry-level employment\u201d* and that *no evidence was collected* to support or refute any causal claim (Finding 3).\n\n2. **Lack of concrete case\u2011study evidence on specific funding shifts**  \n   - Finding 2 discusses major funding changes (e.g., stimulus packages, infrastructure bills, defense sequestration) only in hypothetical or generalized terms and notes that this is based on common knowledge rather than collected evidence. It therefore does **not** document measured employment effects in specific sectors (Finding 2).\n\n3. **Sectors identified as most directly tied to federal funding**  \n   - Finding 4 identifies **Services** and **Manufacturing** as the sectors \u201cmost directly tied to federal funding\u201d and as showing \u201ctypical employment sensitivity\u201d:\n     - Services: frequently receive federal grants and contracts for a wide range of activities, making employment in this sector \u201chighly susceptible\u201d to shifts in government spending (Finding 4).\n     - Manufacturing: federal procurement (especially defense and infrastructure related) creates demand for manufactured goods, leading to \u201cdirect employment impacts\u201d from changes in funding (Finding 4).  \n   - However, Finding 4 does **not** quantify how much employment changed in these sectors in response to specific funding increases or cuts, nor does it tie the sensitivity to particular programs or time periods.\n\n4. **Overall conclusion relative to the question**  \n   - The research as conducted does **not** document concrete, empirically measured employment changes in specific sectors resulting from identified federal funding changes.  \n   - The only sector-specific statement supported by the findings is that **services and manufacturing are more directly exposed to federal funding and therefore their employment is considered more sensitive to funding shifts** (Finding 4).  \n   - Any stronger statement\u2014such as \u201cfederal funding increase X caused Y jobs in sector Z\u201d or \u201cemployment in a given sector rose/fell by a given percentage after a particular funding change\u201d\u2014is not supported, because the findings explicitly report that **no relevant evidence was collected** for causal or quantitative assessment (Findings 1\u20133).",

Federal grant uncertainty affected nonprofits (Cleveland, New York, Boston). Policy uncertainty was a top business concern (Dallas). Immigration policy changes created labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston). The potential for government shutdown was highlighted as a downside risk. Kansas City noted that despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic.",
      "answer": "The research was largely unable to document specific, district\u2011level factors behind economic uncertainty. For most of the areas you were interested in\u2014Beige Book mentions (Finding 1), manufacturing/energy/agriculture\u2011heavy districts (Finding 2), and labor market/wage/inflation sources by district (Finding 3)\u2014no evidence was collected, so no concrete uncertainty drivers can be identified from those sources.\n\nThe only area where specific factors are documented is in financial conditions, credit, housing, and commercial real estate (CRE) (Finding 4):\n\n- **Credit conditions and bank lending**\n  - In the **Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia**\u2019s district, bank lending (excluding credit cards) **declined moderately** over the period studied, which contrasted with modest growth in the comparable period of 2024 and with lending having held steady in the prior period. This weakening in lending volumes is part of the financial environment contributing to uncertainty there. [Finding 4; Philadelphia chunk]\n  - In the **Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas** district, banks **continued tightening credit standards** for most loan types, with only a slight easing for residential real estate loans. Bankers also expected to **tighten credit standards further** over the next three months for all loan types except residential real estate, where standards were expected to remain unchanged. This ongoing and anticipated tightening contributes to uncertainty around access to credit. [Finding 4; Dallas chunk]\n\n- **Loan demand and performance**\n  - In the **Dallas** district, **loan volume and demand increased**, but **overall loan performance deteriorated slightly**, even as performance for commercial real estate loans \u201csharply improved.\u201d Bankers reported **mixed outlooks**, expecting an acceleration in loan demand and increasing business activity six months ahead but also a **moderate deterioration in loan performance**. These mixed expectations and deterioration in performance are cited as elements of economic uncertainty. [Finding 4; Dallas chunk]\n  - The broader synthesis notes that in multiple districts **economic uncertainty affected loan demand** and contributed to a more pessimistic outlook in credit and housing, although specific additional districts beyond those named are not identified in the findings. [Finding 4 summary; Economic Uncertainty edges]\n\n- **Commercial real estate and construction**\n  - In the **Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City** district, **commercial real estate (CRE) activity declined moderately**, with decreases in:\n    - Sales of construction materials  \n    - Volume of construction underway  \n    - Prices for construction materials  \n    Construction employment faced headwinds from this slowdown. Despite these declines, **financial aspects of CRE activity\u2014credit standards, access to credit, and loan demand\u2014were reported as stable**, and overall CRE activity remained near its historical norm. The contrast between falling activity and stable credit conditions is part of the mixed signals feeding uncertainty. [Finding 4; Kansas City chunk]\n\n- **Housing outlook and broader uncertainty**\n  - The synthesized evidence states that in some districts, including **Dallas**, **economic uncertainty was explicitly cited as contributing to a pessimistic housing outlook** and influencing firm decisions and buyer behavior. However, beyond this general statement, no additional district\u2011specific housing factors are detailed in the findings. [Finding 4 summary; Economic Uncertainty edges]\n\nAcross districts where evidence exists (Philadelphia, Dallas, Kansas City), the specific, documented contributors to economic uncertainty are:\n\n1. **Moderate declines in bank lending volumes** (Philadelphia).\n2. **Ongoing and expected tightening of credit standards** across most loan types (Dallas).\n3. **Deterioration in overall loan performance despite some segment\u2011specific improvements** (Dallas).\n4. **Moderate declines in CRE activity and related construction indicators, even with stable credit conditions** (Kansas City).\n5. **Pessimistic housing outlooks and cautious firm and buyer behavior explicitly linked to economic uncertainty** (at least in Dallas, and more generally \u201csome districts,\u201d though others are not named).\n\nThe findings do not provide specific evidence on uncertainty drivers related to inflation, labor markets, supply chains, or sector\u2011specific shocks beyond what is summarized above.",

      "question": "Which retail categories saw gains versus declines, and how does this reflect consumer behavior patterns?",
      "expected": "In Chicago, leisure and hospitality sales were mixed. Categories seeing gains included restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments, as well as new light vehicle sales which were brisk due to strong underlying demand and the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases. Categories seeing softness included travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels. Used vehicle sales remained steady though dealerships in low-to-moderate income communities reported softer demand. This pattern reflects consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.",
      "answer": "Recent evidence points to a clear split between **essential (staples) categories showing resilience or growth** and **discretionary categories seeing softness or declines**, and this aligns with a broader pullback in retail goods spending and a shift toward value.\n\n### 1. Categories seeing gains or resilience\n\n**Essentials / staples:**\n\n- **Consumer Staples Distribution & Retail / Food Products**\n  - Demand for *Food Products* within *Consumer Staples Distribution & Retail* has been described as **\u201cvery strong\u201d** and **stable**. Conditions for **Food Products** and **Dairy Products** were reported as **stable**, with **\u201cflat to slight increases\u201d in economic activity** in this segment.  \n  - These categories are characterized as **essential goods**, and the findings indicate they are **among the categories experiencing demand and relative strength** compared with others.  \n  *(Source: Consumer Staples Distribution & Retail and Food Products entity explorations, 2025-10-15)*\n\n- **Higher\u2011income luxury spending (select items/services)**\n  - While not broken out as a specific retail category, spending by **higher\u2011income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation** was reported as **strong**, even as overall consumer spending softened.  \n  *(Source: Consumer Spending chunk, National Summary > Overall Economic Activity)*\n\n- **Automotive (select subsegment)**\n  - **Auto sales** were *boosted* in some districts due to **strong demand for electric vehicles** ahead of a federal tax credit expiration. This is a time\u2011limited boost to a specific subcategory but indicates a **gain for EV auto sales** during the reporting period.  \n  *(Source: Consumer Spending chunk, National Summary > Overall Economic Activity)*\n\n### 2. Categories seeing declines or softness\n\n**Overall retail goods and discretionary categories:**\n\n- **Retail goods overall**\n  - **Overall consumer spending, particularly on retail goods, \u201cinched down in recent weeks.\u201d** Retail goods experienced a **slight decline** and **softened demand**, indicating broad pressure across goods categories.  \n  *(Source: Consumer Spending neighbors showing DECREASED_PARTICULARLY_FOR \u2192 Retail Goods, and DECLINED_SLIGHTLY_FOR \u2192 Retail Goods)*\n\n- **Specialty Retail (discretionary)**\n  - **Specialty Retail** (a largely discretionary segment) **\u201cexperienced lower sales\u201d** during the reporting period and was cited as a **lower component of consumer spending**.  \n  *(Source: Specialty Retail entity exploration, edges EXPERIENCED_LOWER_SALES_DURING and EXPERIENCED_LOWER_COMPONENT_OF \u2192 Consumer Spending, 2025-10-15)*\n\n- **Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods**\n  - Consumer spending **softened for Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods**. These are identified as more **sensitive to economic fluctuations and consumer confidence** and are inferred to be **in the declining or stagnant segment** relative to staples.  \n  *(Source: Consumer Spending neighbors SOFTENED_FOR \u2192 Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods; Finding 1 synthesis)*\n\n- **Household Products / Household Durables (indicators of pressure)**\n  - Consumer spending **softened for Household Products**, and **Household Durables** are characterized as more economically sensitive, suggesting they are also under pressure and **not showing robust growth compared with staples**.  \n  *(Source: Consumer Spending neighbors SOFTENED_FOR \u2192 Household Products; Finding 1 synthesis mentioning Household Durables as likely weaker)*\n\n- **Broadline Retail**\n  - Consumer spending **\u201cinched down recently especially for Broadline Retail,\u201d** indicating **softening sales** for large, multi\u2011category retail formats.  \n  *(Source: Consumer Spending neighbors INCHED_DOWN_RECENTLY_ESPECIALLY_FOR \u2192 Broadline Retail, doc 2025-10-15)*\n\n### 3. How these gains and declines reflect consumer behavior patterns\n\n**Shift toward essentials and value, with overall softening in goods:**\n\n- **Overall softening in goods spending**\n  - Consumer spending on **retail goods has decreased slightly and softened**, indicating consumers are generally **pulling back on goods purchases**.  \n  *(Source: Consumer Spending neighbors DECREASED_PARTICULARLY_FOR \u2192 Retail Goods; EXPERIENCED_A_SLIGHT_DECLINE_WITHIN \u2190 Retail Goods)*\n\n- **Resilience in essentials (food and staples)**\n  - **Very strong, stable demand for Food Products** within staples retail, combined with only **flat-to-slight increases** rather than declines, shows that **consumers are prioritizing essential goods**.  \n  *(Source: Consumer Staples Distribution & Retail and Food Products evidence)*\n\n- **Pressure on discretionary and non-essential retail**\n  - **Lower sales in Specialty Retail**, **softened spending on Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods**, and **declines in Broadline Retail** all indicate that **discretionary categories are where consumers are cutting back first**.  \n  *(Sources: Specialty Retail, Consumer Spending edges to Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods and Broadline Retail)*\n\n- **Trade\u2011down and value\u2011seeking behavior**\n  - Lower- and middle-income households **\u201ccontinued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty,\u201d** signaling a **trade\u2011down toward value** even as they maintain spending on essentials.  \n  *(Source: Consumer Spending chunk, National Summary)*\n\n- **Inflation\u2019s role**\n  - Contacts reported that **inflation is eroding consumer purchasing power**, which helps explain the **pullback in discretionary categories** and **heightened value-consciousness**.  \n  *(Source: Inflation entity exploration, edges REPORT_IS_ERODING_CONSUMER_PURCHASING_POWER \u2192 Consumer Spending, 2025-10-15)*\n\n- **Segmented behavior by income**\n  - While many households are trading down, **higher\u2011income consumers continue to spend strongly on luxury travel and accommodations**, demonstrating **uneven consumer behavior across income groups**: robust luxury/experience spending at the top, versus constrained, value-seeking behavior for essentials in the broader population.  \n  *(Source: Consumer Spending chunk, National Summary)*\n\n### 4. Overall interpretation\n\nBased on the findings:\n\n- **Categories with gains or resilience:**  \n  - Essentials and staples, especially **Food Products** within **Consumer Staples Distribution & Retail**, and specific pockets like **EV auto sales** and **luxury travel/accommodation** for higher\u2011income consumers.\n\n- **Categories with declines or softness:**  \n  - Broad-based **retail goods**, especially **Specialty Retail**, **Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods**, **Household Products/Household Durables**, and **Broadline Retail**.\n\nThese patterns collectively reflect a consumer environment where **inflation and economic uncertainty are pushing most households to protect spending on essentials, trade down for value, and cut back on discretionary retail purchases**, while **higher\u2011income consumers sustain demand in certain luxury and experience-related areas.**",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is Chicago-specific and highlights gains in fast food/fast casual/family dining restaurants and new light vehicle sales (brisk due to underlying demand and EV tax incentive expiration), softness in travel-related categories (airlines/hotels), and steady used vehicle sales with weaker demand in lower-income areas\u2014reflecting value-seeking in dining while cutting back on travel. The agent instead discusses broad national/staples vs discretionary patterns (food products, specialty retail, apparel, broadline retail) and even claims strong luxury travel/accommodation, which contradicts the expected softness in airlines/hotels.

In Dallas (Eleventh District), drilling and well completion activity was flat. Nationally, energy activity was generally down among reporting districts. The Chicago District noted higher energy prices as part of nonlabor cost increases affecting manufacturers.",
      "answer": "Energy sector performance differed by type of energy activity and across districts, but the available findings are only specific for certain components of the sector and do not provide a full district\u2011by\u2011district map.\n\n**Variation across districts and activities**\n\n- **Energy Equipment & Services (including drilling and well completions)**  \n  - For the **Eleventh District / Dallas** (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas), conditions in *Energy Equipment & Services* were reported as **flat over the reporting period**, with:\n    - \u201cEnergy Equipment & Services \u2026 was flat in Eleventh District / Dallas\u201d and \u201cexperienced flat levels \u2026 during the reported period\u201d [Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Summary of Economic Activity, 2025\u201110\u201115].  \n    - Contacts in this context \u201creported that drilling activity was mostly steady\u201d and that \u201cdrilling and well completion activity \u2026 was [flat/steady]\u201d in Dallas [contacts; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2025\u201110\u201115].\n  - In cross\u2011district summary form, **contacts across districts** reported a **mix of steady and declining conditions**:\n    - \u201cEnergy Equipment & Services \u2026 reported steady for nearly two thirds of contacts,\u201d while other contacts \u201creported declines\u201d and a \u201cdistribution of steady and declining\u201d conditions [contacts (general Fed contacts), 2025\u201110\u201115].  \n  - Overall, for this segment, performance **varied across districts**: some areas (notably Dallas/Eleventh District) were flat/steady, while a subset of contacts in other districts reported declines.\n\n- **Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels; Energy Prices**  \n  - At the aggregate (not district\u2011specific) level, reports on **oil, gas & consumable fuels** indicated **strong demand, increased production, and elevated prices** for crude oil and natural gas, and **rising energy prices** were notable in \u201cseveral districts\u201d [Energy Prices; Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels, most recent Beige Book period].  \n  - However, the findings explicitly state that **no usable evidence was collected on district\u2011level mentions of oil, gas, and extraction activity**, so **variation by specific district for oil and gas extraction cannot be determined** from the available data [district\u2011level oil/gas finding, confidence 0.0].\n\n- **Electric Utilities & Multi\u2011Utilities (power and general energy costs)**  \n  - **Electric utilities** are linked, at the district level, to:\n    - **Capacity constraints** that \u201cconstrained ability \u2026 to build housing developments\u201d and \u201cprevented construction of housing\u201d in some areas [Electric Utilities \u2192 Communities/Housing Market, 2025\u201110\u201115].\n    - **Solid demand in the commercial and industrial sectors** [Electricity, 2025\u201110\u201115].\n    - A role in episodes where utilities \u201ccontributed to a dip in production levels\u201d at **Gulf Coast refineries** and to a \u201cdip in manufacturing production\u201d [Gulf Coast Refineries; Manufacturing, 2025\u201110\u201115].  \n    These references indicate **non\u2011uniform impacts across districts**, but the exact districts are not named in the evidence provided.\n  - **Multi\u2011utilities** (bundled electricity/gas and related services) were linked, at the district level, to:\n    - **Increased difficulty paying utility bills** among **low\u2011 and moderate\u2011income households** [Low\u2011 and Moderate\u2011Income Households, 2025\u201110\u201115].\n    - **Higher costs for businesses and households**, \u201ccontinued cost pressures,\u201d and contributions to **inflation**, higher **cost structures**, and broader **price pressures** [Most Business Contacts; federal reserve bank of san francisco; Business Contacts; Several Contacts, 2025\u201110\u201115].  \n    These effects were noted in multiple districts, including the area covered by the **Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco**, but the findings do not quantify relative severity by district.\n\n- **Independent Power & Renewable Electricity (renewables)**  \n  - For **Independent Power & Renewable Electricity**, the only district\u2011linked evidence is that these activities \u201cslowed down during this time span\u201d in connection with **financial reporting** [Independent Power & Renewable Electricity \u2192 Financial Reporting, 2025\u201110\u201115].  \n  - The findings note that **direct district\u2011level elaboration on renewable electricity is sparse**; thus, **variation in renewables performance across specific districts cannot be detailed** from the current evidence.\n\n**Specific energy activities mentioned**\n\nFrom the above, the concrete activities explicitly mentioned are:\n\n- **Energy Equipment & Services / Oilfield activity**\n  - Drilling activity (reported \u201cmostly steady\u201d in Dallas/Eleventh District).\n  - Well completion activity (flat/steady in Dallas/Eleventh District).\n  - General Energy Equipment & Services activity (flat in Eleventh District; mix of steady and declining conditions across contacts in other districts).\n\n- **Oil, gas, and fuel\u2011related**\n  - Increased production of crude oil and natural gas (aggregate, not tied to specific districts).\n  - Elevated prices for crude oil and natural gas (noted in several districts, but not individually named).\n\n- **Electric utilities and multi\u2011utilities**\n  - Provision of electricity for:\n    - Housing development (where electric\u2011utility capacity constraints limited or prevented new housing construction in some districts).\n    - Commercial and industrial demand (solid demand reported).\n  - Utility\u2011related cost pressures:\n    - Higher household utility bills and associated payment difficulties (especially for low\u2011 and moderate\u2011income households).\n    - Higher energy\u2011related operating costs for businesses, contributing to inflation and higher cost structures.\n\n- **Refining and manufacturing interactions**\n  - Electric\u2011utility\u2011related issues contributing to **dips in production levels** at **Gulf Coast refineries** and in **manufacturing** (district context implied but not named).\n\n- **Renewable/independent power**\n  - Independent power and renewable electricity projects/operations that **slowed down** during the reported financial period (with no further district\u2011specific activity detail).\n\n**What cannot be determined from the findings**\n\n- The research explicitly states that it is **not possible to determine district\u2011level prevalence or nature of oil, gas, and extraction activity** beyond the broad oil/gas price and production statements.\n- Apart from the Eleventh District/Dallas example for Energy Equipment & Services, and scattered references involving the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Gulf Coast refineries, **a complete, district\u2011by\u2011district quantitative comparison of energy sector performance is not supported** by the collected evidence.",

Employment in IT services increased modestly with hiring in sales and technical positions - a relative bright spot. Jobseekers in Cleveland reported offers were more likely to be part-time with little or no benefits. This pattern indicates employer uncertainty and reluctance to commit to permanent workforce expansion.",

      "reasoning": "The expected answer lists specific Chicago (Seventh) District Beige Book-style indicators (activity, consumer spending, manufacturing, employment, wages, prices, financial conditions, construction/real estate, farm income) and compares each to national trends. The agent instead claims insufficient evidence and provides only a generic note about national statistical releases, failing to identify or compare the Chicago District indicators at all. This does not address the question and contradicts the expectation that these indicators are known.",
