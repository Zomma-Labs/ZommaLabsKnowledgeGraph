(Finding 1; \u201cWhat is the Beige Book?\u201d; Beige Book title page)\n\nIts purpose is to characterize how economic conditions have changed since the previous report and to complement other forms of regional information gathering, using input collected through a wide range of contacts via formal and informal methods. (Finding 2, \u201cWhat is the purpose of the Beige Book?\u201d)\n\nThe Beige Book is published by the Federal Reserve System and released eight times per year. (Finding 1; Finding 2, \u201cWhat is the Beige Book?\u201d)\n\nFor content and structure, each Federal Reserve Bank gathers information on current economic conditions in its District through reports from Bank and Branch directors, interviews, and online questionnaires.

\u201cmiddle-income consumers are increasingly cautious\u201d).  \n- **Wage growth was modest** and **employment largely flat**, so incomes were not rising fast enough to offset price pressures, reinforcing the need to cut spending or borrow (\u201cemployment held steady\u2026 wage growth remained modest\u201d;

      "question": "How did employers' hiring preferences change?",
      "expected": "Employers that reported hiring generally noted improved labor availability, and some favored hiring temporary and part-time workers over offering full-time employment opportunities.",
      "answer": "Over the last 10\u201315 years, the evidence indicates three main changes in employers\u2019 hiring preferences, plus several underlying drivers:\n\n1. **What employers look for in candidates (skills and attributes)**  \n   - Employers have increasingly sought a combination of **digital/technical skills** and **critical soft skills** such as critical thinking, problem\u2011solving, and creativity. This pattern is reported across multiple employer and global surveys, including the World Economic Forum\u2019s \u201cFuture of Jobs\u201d reports (2016, 2018, 2020, 2023), ManpowerGroup Talent Shortage surveys, and LinkedIn Global Talent Trends reports (Finding 1; sources cited there).  \n   - At the same time, many employers have become more **cautious in expanding headcount**, focusing more on replacing existing workers than on aggressive hiring, and in some sectors favoring **part\u2011time or temporary roles** over full\u2011time positions (Federal Reserve District labor market reports; Finding 1, Finding 4).\n\n2. **Education vs. skills/experience in hiring criteria**  \n   - The available evidence **does not show a clear, documented shift** away from formal education toward skills/experience in employers\u2019 stated criteria.  \n   - Instead, what is documented is how employers are managing staffing overall:  \n     * \u201cMost employers hired only to replace workers, holding head counts steady.\u201d (Labor Markets, score: 0.25; Finding 2)  \n     * \u201cSeveral contacts in manufacturing and health care noted reductions in staff levels through attrition, layoffs, and early retirements. In some cases, employment reductions were coupled with investment in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly for positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees.\u201d (Labor Markets, score: 0.25; Finding 2)  \n   - Because no direct survey or quantitative data on changing degree vs. skills requirements was found, we **cannot substantively conclude** that employers\u2019 formal education requirements have systematically weakened relative to skills/experience over this period (Finding 2).\n\n3. **Preferences about remote work, flexible arrangements, and geography**  \n   - The search and evidence base **did not yield direct data** on employers\u2019 preferences for remote work, hybrid/flexible work, or geographic constraints in hiring (e.g., same state/time zone requirements).  \n   - The available documents focus instead on overall labor market conditions (employment levels, wages, uncertainty) and not on work\u2011location or schedule policies (Finding 3).  \n   - As a result, **no evidence\u2011based statement can be made** about changes in hiring preferences related to remote or flexible work from these sources.\n\n4. **Documented drivers behind recent changes in hiring preferences**  \n   The observed shifts\u2014greater emphasis on certain skills and more cautious, replacement\u2011focused hiring\u2014are linked in the evidence to four main drivers:\n\n   - **Economic uncertainty and weaker demand**  \n     * \u201cIn most Districts, more employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition, with contacts citing weaker demand, elevated economic uncertainty...\u201d (LaborMarkets, score: 0.39; Finding 4)  \n     * \u201cDeclining business activity led to reduced labor demand, and in some cases, to layoffs.\u201d (Labor Markets, score: 0.30; Finding 4)  \n     These conditions contribute to employers\u2019 more conservative hiring, including slower expansion and more selectivity.\n\n   - **Increased investment in AI and automation**  \n     * \u201cEmployment reductions were coupled with investment in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly for positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees.\u201d (Labor Markets, score: 0.36; Finding 4)  \n     * Reports of \u201cincreased investment in artificial intelligence technologies\u201d associated with lower headcounts (LaborMarkets, score: 0.39; Finding 4).  \n     This indicates that for some tasks/roles\u2014especially entry\u2011level or less\u2011experienced positions\u2014employers are substituting technology for human hiring.\n\n   - **Labor shortages tied to immigration policy and demographics**  \n     * \u201cContacts in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture continue to report labor shortages due to workers not reporting to work because of fears of deportation.\u201d (Labor Markets, score: 0.35; Finding 4)  \n     * \u201cImpacts from changes to immigration policy and enforcement were more material than previously reported but were concentrated in certain geographies like south Georgia and sectors such as agriculture and hospitality.\u201d (Labor Markets, score: 0.37; Finding 4)  \n     These shortages push employers in some sectors to adjust hiring practices, although the evidence mostly documents the shortages and cost pressures rather than detailed changes in selection criteria.\n\n   - **Shift toward temporary / part\u2011time roles in some cases**  \n     * \u201cEmployers that [preferred] part-time workers over offering full-time employment opportunities.\u201d (LaborMarkets, score: 0.39; Finding 4)  \n     Together with the AI examples above, this suggests a preference in some contexts for more flexible or lower\u2011commitment staffing models rather than permanent, full\u2011time hires.\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis answer to the original question (\u201cHow did employers\u2019 hiring preferences change?\u201d):**\n\nBased on the available evidence, over roughly the last decade employers\u2019 hiring preferences have:\n\n- **Shifted toward candidates with strong digital/technical capabilities and enduring soft skills** (critical thinking, problem\u2011solving, creativity), as documented in global employer and skills surveys (World Economic Forum \u201cFuture of Jobs,\u201d ManpowerGroup, LinkedIn; Finding 1).  \n- **Become more cautious and replacement\u2011focused rather than expansion\u2011oriented**, with many employers holding headcounts steady or reducing them through attrition/layoffs, sometimes in tandem with **greater AI investment** that specifically targets tasks formerly done by less\u2011experienced workers (Labor Markets reports; Findings 1, 2, 4).  \n- **Shown a tendency in some sectors to prefer part\u2011time or temporary staffing** instead of adding full\u2011time roles, under conditions of economic uncertainty (LaborMarkets; Finding 4).  \n\nThe evidence base used here **does not provide solid documentation** of:  \n- A broad, quantifiable shift from formal education credentials to skills/experience in hiring criteria; or  \n- Systematic changes in employer preferences around remote/hybrid work or geographic hiring constraints.",

      "reasoning": "The expected answer has two key points: (1) employers reported improved labor availability, and (2) some preferred hiring temporary/part-time workers over offering full-time roles.

      "answer": "Labor cost pressures intensified mainly because of tighter labor supply in specific sectors and stronger competition for workers, driven by:\n\n1. **Immigration policy changes and enforcement reducing labor supply**\n   - Contacts in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture reported labor shortages because some workers were not reporting to work due to fears of deportation; a construction firm in Memphis explicitly said the reduced labor pool was driving up labor costs.

(Finding 1; Finding 2; Finding 3; Finding 4: Labor Markets)\n   - Post\u2011COVID, some sectors such as hospitality, tourism, agriculture, construction, and certain manufacturing niches faced localized labor tightness and shortages, contributing to higher wages and hiring costs there. (Finding 1; Finding 2; Finding 4: Labor Markets)\n\n4. **Policy\u2011driven and structural constraints on labor supply**\n   - Changes to immigration policy and enforcement became \u201cmore material than previously reported\u201d for labor supply in sectors like agriculture and hospitality, intensifying wage and hiring pressures.

(Finding 3: Community Perspectives; Labor Markets)\n\nTogether, these factors\u2014especially immigration\u2011related labor shortages, sector\u2011specific tightness, and persistent competition for workers\u2014are identified in the findings as the primary drivers behind the intensification of labor cost pressures.",

      "expected": "Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity.",
      "answer": "Residential real estate  \n\n- Activity and demand: Multiple Federal Reserve District contacts reported that U.S. residential real estate activity was weak, slow, or flat, with declining or flat home sales and choppy, lackluster foot traffic (Residential Real Estate; ConstructionandRealEstate; RealEstateandConstruction, various districts).  \n- Prices: House prices rose moderately compared with a year earlier, with this growth slower than in the prior period; condo prices fell modestly in some areas (Residential Real Estate, U.S. housing market 2023\u20132024 search). Several Northern California contacts observed that prices eased as developers offered incentives (Real Estate and Construction, Northern California contacts).  \n- Inventory and new supply: Inventories in some markets increased sharply from the previous August, extending an earlier trend (Residential Real Estate, U.S. housing market 2023\u20132024 search). In another period, home inventories fell slightly but remained elevated (ConstructionandRealEstate, housing market activity remained weak). New residential construction was limited, with some contacts citing competition for work, and home starts slowed further in certain districts (Real Estate and Construction; ConstructionandRealEstate).  \n- Builder behavior and incentives: Builders in several districts relied on marketing and incentives\u2014including discounting and mortgage-rate buydowns\u2014to close deals (ConstructionandRealEstate; Real Estate and Construction). Developers also continued to offer incentives to buyers in parts of Northern California (Real Estate and Construction).  \n- Demand patterns: Some contacts reported declining demand in recent weeks, with expectations of flat demand in coming months (RealEstateandConstruction, residential contacts). In some areas, lower-priced homes sold quickly while higher-end homes were not moving, and rural markets were negatively affected by weak agriculture conditions and hospital financial stress (RealEstateandConstruction, rural-area contacts).  \n- Rentals: Rents continued to rise, with New York City rents at historic highs (RealEstateandConstruction, Rochester/NYC contacts). In the same context, contacts anticipated some reduction in rental demand as mortgage rates eased (RealEstateandConstruction, rental demand outlook).\n\nCommercial real estate  \n\n- Overall activity level: Across sources, commercial real estate (CRE) activity was described as mixed but slightly improving or flat. Some reports noted that CRE activity experienced a slight uptick (RealEstateandConstruction, Virginia broker) or was up slightly net of seasonal factors (Commercial Real Estate, Boston-area contacts), while others said CRE activity was unchanged on balance (Real Estate and Construction, Northern California contacts) or declined moderately (RealEstateandConstruction, CRE activity declined moderately).  \n- Sector performance:  \n  - Retail and medical: Retail space and medical offices were reported to be performing well in one district (RealEstateandConstruction, Virginia and other agents). Another source noted retail leasing activity as stable, with modest rent growth and low vacancies (Commercial Real Estate, Boston).  \n  - Office: Big-box and office spaces were encountering difficulties in at least one district (RealEstateandConstruction, Virginia broker). In the Boston-area CRE report, office rents were flat while operating costs continued to rise (Commercial Real Estate). One set of contacts reported that office leasing activity had picked up, supported by restaurant-group demand, but prices and rents were unchanged (ConstructionandRealEstate, multifamily/office/restaurant contacts).  \n  - Industrial: Industrial leasing and sales activity were characterized as stable in the Boston CRE account (Commercial Real Estate).  \n  - Multifamily within CRE: In the multifamily sector, rent concessions for new tenants had become more common (ConstructionandRealEstate, multifamily contacts). Another CRE summary noted that apartment rents rose, although detailed figures were not provided (Commercial Real Estate).  \n  - Data centers and health care: Nonresidential construction increased slightly in one district as demand remained robust for data centers and health-care facilities (ConstructionandRealEstate, nonresidential construction).  \n- Regional and qualitative views:  \n  - A Virginia broker described overall CRE conditions as \u201cmurky,\u201d even as activity ticked up slightly (RealEstateandConstruction, Virginia broker).  \n  - In New York, commercial real estate markets were reported as continuing to improve in the same context where New York City residential rents were at historic highs (RealEstateandConstruction, Rochester/NY contacts).  \n  - In another district, CRE activity was mixed, with a developer in Memphis describing varied conditions and rural markets facing added stress (RealEstateandConstruction, Memphis/rural contacts).  \n- Development and construction: Some districts reported moderate declines in CRE-related development, including lower sales of construction materials, reduced construction volume underway, and pressure on construction employment (RealEstateandConstruction, CRE activity declined moderately). Another district noted nonresidential construction activity recording slight declines even as nonresidential leasing and transaction volumes posted slight growth (RealEstateandConstruction, nonresidential markets).",

The agent instead provides a long, detailed summary focused on housing/CRE activity, prices, inventory, and sector breakdowns, but does not convey the key expected point about interest-rate-sensitive sectors being mixed in connection with improved business lending from lower rates versus continued muted activity.

Foot traffic and sales continued to be choppy and lackluster despite the recent dip in mortgage rates.\u201d (Construction and Real Estate \u2013 Beige Book).  \n   * **Closed sales:** \u201cHome sales throughout the District declined moderately,\u201d and elsewhere, \u201cclosed sales of single-family homes were flat or down slightly overall (as of August).\u201d  \n     *Evidence:* Construction and Real Estate excerpts and Residential Real Estate summary.  \n\n2. **Prices and price trends**  \n   * **Home prices:** House prices were **rising, but only moderately**, with **slower growth than in the prior period**. Condo prices fell modestly in some areas.  \n     *Evidence:* \u201cHouse prices rose moderately on average from a year earlier, representing somewhat slower growth than in the previous report, and condo prices fell modestly in some areas.\u201d (Residential Real Estate \u2013 Beige Book).  \n\n3. **Inventory and days-on-market\u2013type conditions**  \n   * **Inventories:** For for-sale homes, inventory was **elevated and rising on a year-ago basis**:  \n     * \u201cInventories increased sharply from the previous August, extending a trend that began earlier in the year.\u201d (Residential Real Estate \u2013 Beige Book).  \n     * In another period, \u201cHome inventories fell slightly during the reporting period but remained elevated.\u201d (Construction and Real Estate \u2013 Beige Book).  \n   * **Builder side:** Builders reported **slowing home starts** and **rising supply of vacant developed lots**, suggesting increasing slack on the new-construction side.  \n     *Evidence:* \u201cHome starts slowed further, and vacant developed lot supply was rising.\u201d (Construction and Real Estate \u2013 Beige Book).  \n\n4. **Market speed and segment differences**  \n   * Agents \u201cdescribed the residential market as **slow**,\u201d with segmentation:  \n     * **Lower\u2011priced homes** were still selling relatively quickly unless they needed repairs.  \n     * **Higher\u2011end homes** were often \u201cnot moving.\u201d  \n     *Evidence:* \u201cReal estate agents across the District described the residential market as slow\u2026lower-priced homes were selling quickly unless they needed repairs, while higher-end homes were not moving.\u201d (Real Estate and Construction \u2013 Beige Book).  \n\n5. **Rental (multifamily) market conditions**  \n   * **Rents and pricing:** Overall **prices and rents were unchanged** in the relevant real estate segment.  \n     *Evidence:* \u201cPrices and rents were unchanged.\u201d (Construction and Real Estate \u2013 Beige Book excerpt referencing multifamily/CRE).  \n   * **Concessions:** In the multifamily rental sector, **rent concessions for new tenants became more common**, indicating owners using incentives to attract or retain tenants.  \n     *Evidence:* \u201cContacts noted that in the multifamily sector rent concessions for new tenants had become more common.\u201d (Construction and Real Estate \u2013 Beige Book, Dallas-area context).  \n\n6. **Use of incentives and seller behavior**  \n   * **For-sale/new homes:** Builders increasingly relied on **marketing and incentives**, including **discounting and mortgage-rate buydowns**, to close deals.  \n     *Evidence:* \u201cBuilders noted ongoing reliance on marketing and incentives, including discounting and mortgage rate buydowns, to close deals.\u201d (Construction and Real Estate \u2013 Beige Book).  \n   * **Investment/commercial side:** Contacts reported **sellers bringing down asking prices** for some properties to spur movement.  \n     *Evidence:* \u201cContacts noted that sellers have brought down asking prices for properties, opening the door for some movement.\u201d (Construction and Real Estate \u2013 Beige Book).  \n\n7. **Demand, credit conditions, and buyer behavior**  \n   * **Demand:** Overall housing demand was **sluggish**, with **sluggish sales and foot traffic** and a **pessimistic outlook** among builders.  \n     *Evidence:* \u201cOutlooks remained pessimistic amid sluggish demand and elevated econ[omic uncertainty].\u201d (Construction and Real Estate \u2013 Beige Book).  \n   * **Buyer hesitation and credit:**  \n     * Home sales \u201cdeclined moderately\u201d as **economic uncertainty increased buyer hesitation**.  \n     * Some contacts noted a **deterioration in the credit profiles of potential buyers**, making it harder for them to qualify for mortgages.  \n     *Evidence:* \u201cRealtors reported increased buyer hesitation as economic uncertainty weighed on buyers\u2019 decisions to purchase a home. Some contacts noted a deterioration in the credit profiles of potential buyers, making it difficult for many to qualify\u2026\u201d (Construction and Real Estate \u2013 Beige Book).  \n\n8. **Macro/economic factors linked to housing weakness**  \n   * The Dallas District experienced **flat overall economic activity**, with:  \n     * Mild contraction in services, falling retail sales, moderating manufacturing growth.  \n     * **Employment dipping** and **modest wage growth**.  \n     * Price pressures subdued in services but still elevated in some other sectors.  \n   * The Beige Book explicitly associates these conditions with a **weak housing market**.  \n     *Evidence:* \u201cEconomic activity was flat\u2026Retail sales fell\u2026Loan demand grew, but the housing market remained weak\u2026Employment dipped, and wage growth was modest.\u201d (Dallas \u2013 Beige Book summary).  \n     *Evidence:* \u201cEconomic activity in the Eleventh District was little changed\u2026Retail sales fell. Housing market activity remained weak\u2026Employment fell, and wage growth was modest.\u201d (Eleventh District summary).  \n\nIn sum, within the Dallas (Eleventh) District during the reported periods, the housing market was weak: sales were flat to moderately declining, price growth was moderate and slowing, inventories were elevated (and up sharply from a year earlier in some reports), builders and landlords increasingly used incentives (including rent concessions and mortgage buydowns), and economic conditions\u2014flat activity, modest wages, and heightened uncertainty\u2014contributed to sluggish demand and increased buyer hesitation.",

      "question": "How did consumer spending patterns differ between income groups, and what drove those differences?",
      "expected": "Higher-income individuals maintained strong spending on luxury travel and accommodation. Lower- and middle-income households sought discounts and promotions due to rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. This bifurcation was driven by rising prices eroding purchasing power for lower/middle-income groups while higher-income groups remained insulated.",
      "answer": "Across income groups, the research points to three main differences in spending patterns and their drivers, all based on recent U.S. evidence from Federal Reserve Beige Book sources:\n\n1. **Upper\u2011income households vs. middle\u2011income households**\n\n   *Pattern differences*  \n   - Upper\u2011income households and corporate clients \u201ccontinue to spend on travel, events, and luxury services\u201d despite an overall environment where \u201cconsumer spending has slightly declined\u201d ([Consumer Spending, Beige Book, Oct 2025, multiple districts]).  \n   - By contrast, \u201cmiddle\u2011income consumers are increasingly cautious as they have been using credit to maintain their spending levels\u201d ([Consumer Spending, Beige Book, Oct 2025]).\n\n   *Drivers*  \n   - **Access to resources and resilience of higher incomes:** The Beige Book summary for the Second District reports that consumer spending \u201cincreased modestly, in part due to the resilience of mid\u2011 to upper\u2011income households\u201d ([Summary of Economic Activity, Second District]).  \n   - **Reliance on credit for the middle tier:** Multiple districts note that middle\u2011income households are maintaining spending \u201cusing credit\u201d and that there are \u201celevated credit card delinquency rates\u201d and more people going to \u201ccredit counseling agencies after borrowing to maintain\u201d spending ([Consumer Spending, Beige Book, Oct 2025]; [Banking and Finance]). This indicates that continued consumption for middle\u2011income groups is being driven by borrowing rather than income growth.\n\n2. **Lower\u2011income vs. higher\u2011income households**\n\n   *Pattern differences*  \n   - Lower\u2011income households are described as highly selective and deal\u2011oriented: contacts report \u201csales, deals, and purchases by lower income households that need to be more selective\u201d and \u201cheightened price sensitivity\u201d leading to more volatile consumption ([Consumer Spending, multiple districts]).  \n   - In specific markets, \u201cdealerships located in low\u2011to\u2011moderate income communities reported softer [used vehicle] demand,\u201d even as overall used vehicle sales \u201cremained steady\u201d ([Consumer Spending, Beige Book, Oct 2025]).  \n   - Nonprofit and community contacts note that low\u2011 and moderate\u2011income households are struggling with necessities, evidenced by \u201cgreater food pantry use,\u201d \u201cincreased difficulty\u201d meeting needs, and difficulty affording childcare, where \u201cprevailing prices remained difficult for low- and moderate-income families to afford\u201d preschool and especially infant/toddler care ([Community Perspectives, First District]; [Community Conditions]).\n\n   *Drivers*  \n   - **Economic precarity and constrained budgets:** The First District reports an \u201cincreased anxiety and uncertainty regarding the economic situation of low- and moderate-income households,\u201d with \u201cthe prevalence of economic precarity increased in many communities\u201d ([Community Perspectives, First District]). This precarity forces these households to \u201ctake steps to reduce spending where possible\u201d and to be more selective, particularly on non\u2011necessities.  \n   - **High price sensitivity:** Several districts explicitly link recent consumption volatility to \u201cheightened price sensitivity,\u201d with lower\u2011income households especially focused on \u201cvalue and comparative price shopping,\u201d sales, and deals ([Consumer Spending, multiple districts]; [Summary of Economic Activity, some districts]).  \n   - **Limited access to or strained use of credit:** Community and banking contacts report \u201cmoderate deterioration in consumer lending\u201d and expect \u201ccustomers with lower personal incomes\u201d to be \u201cmost likely to face challenges\u201d as disposable incomes decrease ([Community and Regional Banking]). That constraint helps explain both softer demand in low\u2011income markets (e.g., autos) and elevated demand for food pantries and social services.\n\n3. **Necessities vs. discretionary spending across groups**\n\n   *Pattern differences*  \n   - For low\u2011 and moderate\u2011income households, much of the observed stress is around necessities: food (greater \u201cfood pantry use\u201d), utilities and housing assistance (\u201cdemand for rental and housing assistance increased\u201d), and childcare (\u201cprevailing prices remained difficult\u201d for low\u2011 and moderate\u2011income families) ([Community Perspectives]; [Community Perspectives \u2013 nonprofits]; [Community Conditions]). These groups are cutting back \u201cwhere possible,\u201d implying constrained discretionary outlays.  \n   - In contrast, upper\u2011income households\u2019 and high\u2011end consumers\u2019 demand for discretionary and luxury services remains comparatively strong. District contacts report that tourism and hospitality growth is \u201cfueled almost entirely\u201d by luxury accommodations, with a \u201cwidening gap in demand between luxury and budget-friendly accommodations\u201d ([Retail and Tourism, First District]). Similarly, \u201cmid\u2011 to upper\u2011income households\u201d are cited as underpinning modest increases in consumer spending in some regions ([Summary of Economic Activity, Second District]).\n\n   *Drivers*  \n   - **Price and income pressures on necessities for low\u2011income groups:** Rising consumer prices and changes to federal benefit programs are cited as adding \u201cadditional risks to low- and moderate-income households\u201d ([Community Perspectives, First District]). Planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid and tariff\u2011linked price increases are specifically mentioned as exacerbating difficulty affording essentials, which in turn forces reallocation away from discretionary spending.  \n   - **Differences in discretionary capacity:** Because upper\u2011income households are less affected by these constraints, they continue to support demand for luxury travel, events, and high\u2011end hospitality, while budget\u2011constrained consumers pull back, skip extras (e.g., \u201cskipping desserts and/or alcoholic beverages\u201d at restaurants), or trade down ([Consumer Spending, selected districts]).\n\n**Summary**\n\n- **Upper-income households**: Continue robust spending on discretionary categories (travel, luxury services, higher\u2011end tourism), supported by relatively resilient incomes and less binding budget constraints ([Consumer Spending; Retail and Tourism; Summary of Economic Activity, Second District]).  \n- **Middle-income households**: Show caution, using **credit to maintain** prior spending levels, with rising credit card delinquencies and increased reliance on credit counseling indicating that borrowing rather than income is driving their ability to keep spending up ([Consumer Spending; Banking and Finance]).  \n- **Low- and moderate-income households**: Face **economic precarity**, are highly **price\u2011sensitive**, concentrate constrained resources on necessities (food, housing, childcare), increasingly rely on food pantries and social assistance, and show softer demand in discretionary categories such as vehicle purchases and travel ([Consumer Spending; Community Perspectives; Community Conditions]).\n\nAcross all these groups, the primary drivers of differences in spending patterns in the cited evidence are (1) divergence in income resilience, (2) differing access to and use of credit, and (3) varying degrees of price sensitivity and economic precarity, especially among low\u2011 and middle\u2011income households.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer emphasizes a bifurcation: higher-income consumers kept spending strongly on luxury travel/accommodation, while lower- and middle-income consumers became more deal/discount oriented due to rising prices and uncertainty eroding purchasing power for those groups. The agent\u2019s answer captures the core pattern for higher-income (continued luxury travel/hospitality spending) and for lower-income (heightened price sensitivity, selective/deal-seeking, economic precarity). It also mentions elevated uncertainty as a driver. However, for middle-income households it focuses primarily on credit use/delinquencies rather than explicitly stating they sought discounts/promotions; it also adds several extra drivers (credit access, benefit cuts, etc.) that are not part of the expected key framing. Thus it contains most but not all key facts, especially regarding middle-income discount/promotion behavior and the central \"rising prices eroding purchasing power\" framing for middle-income.",

      "expected": "In the Minneapolis District, agricultural contacts were specifically concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases, representing a direct trade policy impact. In the St. Louis District, agriculture conditions were strained and further deteriorated, with the overall pessimistic outlook. Across reporting districts, activity in agriculture was generally down, with trade uncertainty adding to sector challenges.",
      "answer": "Trade-related concerns affected the agriculture sector mainly through weaker export demand (especially from China), depressed crop prices, and resulting financial strain on producers, with impacts differing by district according to production structure.\n\n1. **Nature of trade-related concerns (all districts covered in the reports)**  \n   - Contacts reported that demand from abroad, \u201cparticularly from China, reportedly continued to fall because of trade policy adjustments and negotiations\u201d (Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries).  \n   - Trade policy volatility weighed on agricultural exports: overseas sales of domestic rice declined as buyers sourced from other countries at lower prices, and Chinese markets turned to Brazil for soybeans, wheat, and corn (Energy).  \n   - Agricultural contacts in the Minneapolis District were specifically \u201cconcerned about China\u2019s elimination of soybean purchases\u201d (Minneapolis).\n\n2. **Effects on agricultural production, prices, and incomes**  \n   - In multiple Federal Reserve District agriculture reports, soybean prices were lower \u201cin part due to the absence of new-crop exports to China,\u201d and corn prices were down despite strong export volumes (Agriculture; Agriculture, Energy, and Natural Resources).  \n   - These low crop prices, combined with elevated expenses, were \u201cweighing down producer incomes\u201d (Agriculture, Energy, and Natural Resources).  \n   - Even where \u201coverall demand for agricultural products was healthy,\u201d trade policy volatility still depressed export sales and kept prices for soybean, wheat, and corn subdued (Energy).\n\n3. **District- and region-level variation in impacts**  \n   - A Kansas City Fed agriculture survey found notable differences by local production mix: \u201cover 80 percent of lenders in crop-heavy areas reported declines in farm income and working capital, compared to about 40 percent in areas with more cattle production\u201d (Kansas City Fed, Agriculture). This indicates that crop-focused districts were more adversely affected than more cattle-oriented districts.  \n   - In crop-heavy districts across multiple Fed agriculture reports, the combination of:  \n     * lower soybean prices due to lost China exports (Agriculture),  \n     * depressed prices for soybean, wheat, and corn as Chinese markets turned to Brazil (Energy), and  \n     * concerns over eliminated soybean purchases (Minneapolis),  \n     translated into sharper declines in farm income and greater financial strain.  \n   - In contrast, districts or areas with stronger livestock/cattle sectors experienced relatively less deterioration in farm income and working capital, as indicated by the lower share (about 40 percent) of lenders reporting declines in those more cattle-focused areas (Kansas City Fed, Agriculture).\n\nIn sum, across Federal Reserve Districts, trade-policy-related declines in export demand\u2014especially from China\u2014depressed key crop prices and reduced farm incomes, with the most severe effects reported in crop-heavy districts and comparatively milder impacts in areas with more diversified or cattle-oriented agricultural production.",

However, it does not accurately or explicitly reflect the St. Louis District detail from the expected answer (strained conditions that further deteriorated with an overall pessimistic outlook), and it adds substantial extra claims (e.g., rice exports, Kansas City lender survey differences) that are not part of the expected cross-district comparison.

      "question": "How did federal policy changes affect nonprofits across multiple districts?",
      "expected": "In the New York District, nonprofits faced challenges due to unpredictable funding and reduction in federal benefit programs, with a community health-care center reporting financial distress among Medicaid patients. In the Cleveland District, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to uncertainty around federal grants. In the Boston District, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health-care sectors.",
      "answer": "Federal policy changes affected nonprofits mainly by altering their funding environment and the demand for their services, with evidence drawn from multiple Federal Reserve District\u2013level reports rather than from sector\u2011wide national evaluations.\n\n1. **Unpredictable and reduced federal-related funding across districts**\n\n   - Across several Federal Reserve \u201cCommunity Conditions\u201d surveys, nonprofits in multiple districts reported that funding had become more unpredictable and was often declining. In a semiannual survey of nonprofits (source: Community Conditions, multiple districts), \u201ca growing share of respondents indicated that funding for their respective organizations decreased over the past six months,\u201d with one organization having to use its reserve fund for operating expenses for the first time in more than ten years. Another respondent reported that nonprofits were not filling open positions \u201cbecause of uncertainty around federal grants.\u201d\n   - Many nonprofits attributed these pressures to \u201ca reduction in federal benefit programs\u201d and uncertainty about federal grants (source: Community Perspectives and Community Conditions, multiple districts). These reductions and uncertainties are characterized in the findings as consequences of federal policy changes affecting benefit programs and grantmaking rather than direct nonprofit\u2011specific legislation.\n\n2. **Increased demand for services as federal benefits were reduced**\n\n   - In several districts, nonprofits reported that federal policy changes affecting benefit programs (e.g., SNAP, Medicaid, other federal assistance) were associated with higher demand for nonprofit services:\n     - Community support organizations saw that \u201cdemand for assistance rose, particularly for food, other basic household necessities, and health care,\u201d while \u201cfunding and grant cuts limited their ability to provide assistance\u201d (source: Community Conditions, multiple districts).\n     - Nonprofits \u201ccontinue to see elevated demand for a broad range of social services. Food and utility assistance remained key needs, while demand for rental and housing assistance increased\u201d (source: Community Perspectives, multiple districts).\n     - In the First District, contacts linked \u201cplanned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid\u201d and tariff\u2011related price increases to rising economic precarity and \u201cgreater food pantry use\u201d (source: Community Perspectives, First District).\n   - A community health-care center reported that \u201cfinancial distress among Medicaid generally, rising business costs, including insurance, added to financial pressures for community service providers\u201d (source: Community Perspectives, multiple districts). This indicates federal health\u2011policy\u2011related changes (e.g., Medicaid financing and rules) increased financial strain on health nonprofits.\n\n3. **Operational and workforce impacts tied to federal grants and benefits**\n\n   - In labor market reports, \u201ccuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health-care sectors\u201d (source: Labor Markets, multiple districts). Because many education and health-care providers in these districts operate as nonprofits, this implies federal grant reductions translated into nonprofit job losses and reduced capacity.\n   - Nonprofits reported specific operational consequences of funding uncertainty:\n     - Not filling open positions due to \u201cuncertainty around federal grants\u201d (source: Community Conditions, multiple districts).\n     - Drawing down reserves for the first time in over a decade to maintain operations (source: Community Conditions, multiple districts).\n\n4. **Sectoral examples in education, health, housing, and basic needs**\n\n   While the evidence does not provide a systematic district\u2011by\u2011district comparison, it does give cross\u2011district examples in multiple fields:\n\n   - **Health and community health centers:** A community health\u2011care center noted that \u201cfinancial distress among Medicaid generally\u201d and rising costs increased financial pressures (source: Community Perspectives, multiple districts), linking federal health program conditions to nonprofit strain.\n   - **Education and health employment:** \u201cCuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health-care sectors\u201d (source: Labor Markets, multiple districts), affecting nonprofit schools and health providers in those districts.\n   - **Housing and homelessness services:** Nonprofits reported rising \u201cdemand for rental and housing assistance\u201d while also facing funding and grant cuts that \u201climited their ability to provide assistance\u201d (source: Community Perspectives and Community Conditions, multiple districts). These statements appear in the context of broader discussions of HUD and housing\u2011related funding, although the excerpts do not attribute district\u2011specific numbers.\n   - **Food and basic assistance providers:** District reports tied \u201cplanned cuts to SNAP\u201d and other benefit reductions to increased food pantry use and higher demand for nonprofit assistance (source: Community Perspectives and Community Conditions, multiple districts).\n\n5. **Cross\u2011district commonalities and limits of the evidence**\n\n   - Across multiple Federal Reserve District Beige Book\u2013style sources (Community Perspectives, Community Conditions, Labor Markets), nonprofits consistently described:\n     - More unpredictable and sometimes reduced funding tied to federal benefit and grant changes.\n     - Elevated demand for services in food, utilities, housing, and health care.\n     - Staffing and operational adjustments (hiring freezes, layoffs, use of reserves).\n   - However, the available evidence does **not** provide:\n     - Quantitative comparisons of the magnitude of these effects by congressional district, county, or state.\n     - Causal estimates of COVID\u2011era programs like PPP, EIDL, CARES, or ARPA on nonprofits by geography.\n   - The research synthesis for COVID\u2011era relief explicitly notes that \u201cthe provided evidence does not directly address the variation in the impact of COVID-era federal relief (PPP, EIDL, CARES, ARPA) on nonprofits across congressional districts or counties\u201d (Finding 3), only general sector challenges.\n\n**Direct answer based on the findings:**  \n\nFederal policy changes\u2014mainly those altering federal benefit programs and grant funding rather than nonprofit\u2011specific statutes\u2014contributed to unpredictable and often reduced funding for nonprofits, rising demand for their services, and staffing and operational cutbacks. These effects were reported in multiple Federal Reserve districts through Community Perspectives, Community Conditions, and Labor Markets reports. Nonprofits in health, education, housing, and social services across districts described similar patterns of financial strain and elevated need, but the available evidence does not supply systematic, comparative metrics of how impacts differed by specific district or county.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer requires district-specific effects: New York nonprofits faced unpredictable funding and reduced federal benefit programs with a community health-care center noting Medicaid patient financial distress; Cleveland nonprofits were not filling open positions due to uncertainty around federal grants; Boston saw layoffs in education and health care due to federal grant cuts. The agent\u2019s response captures these key elements (funding unpredictability/benefit reductions, hiring freezes due to grant uncertainty, and layoffs tied to grant cuts, plus the Medicaid distress example).

In Chicago, a retail industry analyst expected peak tariff impact in the first half of 2026.",
      "answer": "Across sectors, firms responded to tariff\u2011induced cost increases with a mix of partial pass\u2011through to prices, cost absorption, and timing or structure changes in price setting, with clear sectoral differences.\n\n**Manufacturing firms (including autos and other goods producers)**  \n- **Moderate price increases with heterogeneous pass\u2011through:** Manufacturing firms reported that \u201cselling prices increased slightly overall, while rising more sharply in the manufacturing sector due to the widespread impact of tariffs\u201d and that \u201cprices rose moderately\u201d as tariffs raised operating costs. However, \u201cthe extent of those higher costs passing through to final prices varied\u201d ([tariff pass\u2011through manufacturing; sectoral differences steel/autos/machinery/consumer goods]).  \n- **Cost absorption to protect demand:** Some manufacturers, notably auto firms, \u201cwere absorbing these increases to prevent further declines in demand,\u201d keeping prices lower than cost increases would imply ([tariff pass\u2011through manufacturing; heterogenous effects]).  \n- **Delayed/gradual pass\u2011through via inventory management:** Firms in manufacturing reported that some tariff\u2011related input costs \u201chave yet to be passed along to customers\u201d and that they \u201cexpected to raise prices once they worked through their pre\u2011tariff inventory\u201d ([sectoral differences steel/autos/machinery/consumer goods]).

This is a price\u2011cutting or constrained\u2011price environment driven by trade shocks rather than rising tariffs on their inputs.  \n- **Rising input costs with mixed pass\u2011through downstream:** At the same time, \u201ctariff\u2011induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts,\u201d including for food\u2011related items such as \u201cvehicles, beef, coffee, and chocolate,\u201d and for agricultural producers\u2019 inputs (e.g., imported components, chemicals).

Retail and service firms showed more heterogeneous, demand\u2011sensitive pricing (including elasticity\u2011based markups and non\u2011price adjustments), while agriculture and food producers faced a combination of depressed output prices from lost export markets and rising input costs, leading to constrained or delayed price pass\u2011through downstream.",

      "answer": "Federal policy influenced EV sales mainly through federal tax credits, and this, in turn, produced short\u2011term boosts in overall auto sales around policy deadlines.\n\n1. **Relationship between federal policy and EV sales**\n\n   - Federal EV tax credits are explicitly linked to spikes in EV purchases:\n     - \u201cAutomobile dealers experienced a robust surge in new electric vehicle (EV) sales ahead of the expiration of the EV tax credit.\u201d (Consumer Spending)\n     - \u201cAutosales were boosted in some Districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September.\u201d (Overall Economic Activity)\n   - These observations support that the **existence and especially the impending expiration of federal EV tax credits causally increased EV sales**, at least in the short run (Finding 1, Finding 4).\n\n2. **Effect on overall auto sales**\n\n   - The same episodes show that EV\u2011driven surges fed directly into broader light\u2011vehicle sales:\n     - \u201cNew light vehicle sales were brisk, reflecting a combination of strong underlying demand and the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases.\u201d (Consumer Spending; cited in Findings 1, 2, and 3)\n     - \u201cAutosales were boosted in some Districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit\u2026\u201d (Overall Economic Activity; Findings 1, 3, 4)\n   - Thus, **federal EV tax credits temporarily lifted overall new auto sales** when buyers accelerated EV purchases to capture the credit.\n   - Outside these incentive\u2011driven surges, contacts reported some softening and shifts in demand\u2014\u201cdemand continued to shift from SUVs and electric vehicles to family sedans and used vehicles\u201d (Consumer Spending; Findings 2 and 3)\u2014but the provided evidence does not quantify longer\u2011term effects of federal EV policy on total auto market volumes.\n\nIn sum, the findings show a clear short\u2011term causal channel: **federal EV tax credits \u2192 higher EV sales \u2192 noticeable, but time\u2011limited, boosts to overall new light\u2011vehicle sales around credit expirations.** Longer\u2011run or aggregate effects beyond these bursts are not detailed in the cited evidence.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly explains that an expiring federal EV tax credit caused a pre-expiration surge in EV purchases that boosted overall auto sales in some districts. However, it omits the other key expected point: that after the credit ended (notably in the Chicago District), light vehicle sales declined overall, especially EVs, showing a post-expiration drop. Because it lacks this post-expiration/Chicago decline component, the answer is only partially correct.",

      "question": "What were the multiple factors affecting labor costs, and how did they interact with wage growth?",
      "expected": "Wages grew at a modest to moderate pace across all districts. However, labor cost pressures intensified due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses. Additionally, some contacts in the Chicago District reported moderate increases in nonlabor costs including energy and higher prices for raw materials. This meant total compensation costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.",
      "answer": "Multiple factors affected labor costs, and they interacted with wage growth through labor supply, labor demand, sectoral conditions, and firms\u2019 profitability and technology choices. All evidence below is from the cited \u201cLabor Markets\u201d and related Beige Book\u2013type sources.\n\n1. **Labor supply constraints (especially immigration policy and deportation fears)**  \n   - **Factor:** Reduced labor supply and labor shortages in sectors such as manufacturing, construction, agriculture, and hospitality, partly linked to immigration policy changes, visa revocations, and deportation fears.  \n     - Evidence: Contacts in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture reported that \u201clabor shortages due to workers not reporting to work because of fears of deportation\u2026[and] the reduced labor pool was driving up labor costs\u201d (Labor Markets, scores ~0.29\u20130.36). Impacts from immigration policy and enforcement were \u201cmore material than previously reported\u201d in certain geographies (south Georgia) and sectors like agriculture and hospitality (Labor Markets, score: 0.32, 0.34).  \n   - **Interaction with wage growth:** These shortages raised labor costs by forcing firms to pay more to attract or retain workers in the affected sectors and regions. This contributed to **localized wage increases** despite overall moderate wage growth, especially where the labor pool tightened significantly.\n\n2. **Labor demand, business activity, and economic uncertainty (softening labor market conditions)**  \n   - **Factor:** Weaker demand for labor due to softer business activity, elevated uncertainty, and specific sectoral slowdowns.  \n     - Evidence: Contacts across many industries \u201cobserved softening labor market conditions\u201d and a \u201ccontinued decline in demand from manufacturers\u201d (Labor Markets, score: 0.40). In multiple Districts, employers \u201creported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition, with contacts citing weaker demand [and] elevated economic uncertainty\u201d (Labor Markets, scores ~0.28\u20130.34).  \n   - **Interaction with wage growth:** Reduced labor demand **dampened upward wage pressure**. Surveys and payroll data indicated that \u201cwage pressure was easing slightly\u201d and median wages were rising more slowly than earlier in the year (Labor Markets, scores ~0.33\u20130.37). In this environment, many firms reported \u201clittle upward wage pressure,\u201d and wage increases were \u201ctypical of their long-run average\u201d (Labor Markets, scores ~0.35\u20130.42), helping keep overall labor cost growth modest.\n\n3. **Competition in the labor market**  \n   - **Factor:** Persistent competition for workers in certain industries (e.g., banking, professional and business services).  \n     - Evidence: Contacts in banking and professional/business services \u201csaid that they had raised wages because of persistent competition in the labor market\u201d (Labor Markets, scores ~0.30\u20130.47).  \n   - **Interaction with wage growth:** Where competition for talent was strong, firms **raised wages**, increasing labor costs in those segments. This contributed to **sector-specific wage growth** above the overall modest trend, even as aggregate wage pressures were described as easing.\n\n4. **Sector-specific conditions (especially hospitality and tourism)**  \n   - **Factor:** Differences in sectoral demand and labor-market tightness.  \n     - Evidence: \u201cNearly three-quarters of hospitality and tourism firms reported wage increases of three percent or more\u201d (Labor Markets, scores ~0.34\u20130.42). In contrast, manufacturing and some other sectors saw weaker demand and headcount reductions.  \n   - **Interaction with wage growth:** In sectors such as hospitality and tourism, strong demand and/or acute labor shortages generated **relatively high wage growth**, directly elevating labor costs there. At the same time, softer conditions in manufacturing and other sectors contributed to **more modest or steady wages**, muting the aggregate wage and labor-cost increase.\n\n5. **Firm profitability and cost-control strategies**  \n   - **Factor:** Profitability constraints and firms\u2019 efforts to manage overall costs.  \n     - Evidence: Several manufacturers \u201cheld wages steady because of lack of profitability,\u201d and \u201cone restaurateur aimed to hire at as close to minimum wage as possible to bring down overall costs\u201d (Labor Markets, scores ~0.28\u20130.33).  \n   - **Interaction with wage growth:** Where profitability was weak, firms **limited wage increases** or targeted low wage levels, restraining wage growth and therefore labor-cost growth despite any underlying tightness in the labor market. This is consistent with reports that, on balance, wage inflation \u201ccontinued to ease\u201d and that wage growth was \u201cmodest to moderate\u201d (Labor Markets, multiple entries).\n\n6. **Technological investment (especially artificial intelligence) and employment reductions**  \n   - **Factor:** Increased investment in technology and AI, sometimes coupled with layoffs or slower hiring.  \n     - Evidence: In most Districts, more employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition, citing \u201cweaker demand, elevated economic uncertainty, and, in some cases, increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies\u201d (Labor Markets, scores ~0.28\u20130.33). Some employment reductions were \u201ccoupled with investment in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly for positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees\u201d (Labor Markets, score: 0.34\u20130.36).  \n   - **Interaction with wage growth:** By reducing headcounts and replacing some tasks with technology, firms **reduced labor demand**, which contributed to generally **muted wage pressures** and helped keep wage growth modest, even as wages still rose slightly on average.\n\n7. **General macro labor market stance: modest, easing wage growth**  \n   - **Observed outcome (from multiple factors jointly):**  \n     - Wage inflation \u201ccontinued to ease on balance, but firms still reported modest increases\u201d (Labor Markets, scores ~0.35\u20130.42).  \n     - Wage growth \u201cwas modest to moderate,\u201d with surveys suggesting that wage pressure was \u201ceasing slightly\u201d and median wage increases were slower than earlier in the year (Labor Markets, scores ~0.33\u20130.37).  \n     - Contacts widely reported \u201clittle upward wage pressure,\u201d and wage increases were \u201ctypical of their long-run average\u201d (Labor Markets, scores ~0.35\u20130.42).  \n   - **Interaction summary:**  \n     - **Upward forces on labor costs and wages:** localized labor shortages (especially immigration-related), strong sectoral demand (e.g., hospitality/tourism), and competition for specific types of labor.  \n     - **Downward or moderating forces on wage growth and labor costs:** softening overall labor demand, elevated uncertainty, technological substitution (AI), and profitability constraints leading firms to cap or hold wages.  \n     - The net result was **modest overall wage growth and easing wage inflation**, with **pockets of faster wage and labor-cost growth in constrained or competitive sectors**.\n\nIn sum, labor costs were shaped by the interaction of: (1) labor supply constraints (notably from immigration-related factors), (2) labor demand and business conditions, (3) sector-specific competition and demand, (4) firms\u2019 profitability and cost-management strategies, and (5) technological investment and associated headcount reductions. These forces combined to produce **moderate, easing aggregate wage growth**, while generating **higher wage and labor-cost growth in specific sectors and regions experiencing tighter labor markets.**",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says wages rose modestly to moderately, but overall labor cost pressures increased mainly because employer-sponsored health insurance costs rose sharply; it also notes some nonlabor cost increases (energy, raw materials) in Chicago, implying total compensation rose faster than wages alone. The agent\u2019s answer focuses instead on labor supply/demand dynamics, immigration, AI, profitability, and sectoral competition, and does not mention health insurance cost spikes or the cited nonlabor costs. It therefore fails to address the key factors and their interaction with wage growth described in the expected answer.",

Demand from restaurant groups remained solid, as indicated by commercial real estate leasing activity.",
      "answer": "Consumer spending patterns in the Chicago (Seventh) District led to a divergence across restaurant segments:\n\n- Overall consumer spending in the District **slightly declined**, with **middle\u2011income consumers becoming more cautious and relying on credit**, and with rising use of food pantries and elevated credit card delinquencies indicating financial strain for some households (Beige Book, Consumer Spending).\n\n- Within leisure and hospitality, **spending shifted toward lower\u2011 and mid\u2011priced restaurant formats**: multiple sources report **\u201cincreased spending at restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments\u201d** even as leisure and hospitality sales overall were mixed (Beige Book, Consumer Spending; National Restaurant Association Midwest report).\n\n- At the same time, **full\u2011service/casual sit\u2011down restaurants experienced softening demand**: a National Restaurant Association Midwest source notes that **\u201ccasual sit\u2011down restaurants reported a softening\u201d** (Retail, Travel, and Tourism, National Restaurant Association Midwest report).\n\n- During the post\u20112021 recovery and inflation period, **heightened price sensitivity among moderate\u2011 and lower\u2011income consumers** is reported, with evidence of resistance to higher menu prices at restaurants, leading some to **reduce portion sizes or change recipes** (Prices, various Federal Reserve Districts). In this context, the same pattern of **increased spending at fast food, fast casual, and family dining restaurants** and **softening at full\u2011service** is observed (Consumer Spending, various Districts, including the Midwest context).\n\nTogether, these findings indicate that as overall consumer spending softened and middle\u2011income households became more cautious, **restaurant demand in the Chicago/Seventh District shifted away from higher\u2011priced full\u2011service/casual sit\u2011down formats toward fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments, which saw increased spending.**",

      "expected": "Lower interest rates had positive effects across multiple sectors: In Cleveland, commercial construction and financial services saw uptick in demand due to lower rates. In Chicago, financial conditions loosened modestly with business loan volumes increasing. However, the impact was mixed - while some reports noted improved business lending, residential real estate remained weak in Dallas and home sales were flat in Boston. The housing market's response to lower rates was more muted than commercial sectors.",
      "answer": "Across districts, lower interest rates had uneven effects on interest rate\u2011sensitive sectors:\n\n1. **Banking and Finance / Credit Channels (most consistent positive response)**\n   * In multiple districts, **loan demand increased in response to lower rates**:\n     * \u201cOverall, bankers indicated that loan demand increased moderately in recent weeks, as both households and businesses were encouraged by lower interest rates.\u201d (Financial Services)\n     * \u201cLoan volume and demand increased in September\u2026 loan pricing declined.\u201d (Financial Services)\n     * \u201cRecent reductions in interest rates started to spur additional demand for loans, but borrowers remained cautious in light of high uncertainty.\u201d (Financial Institutions, e.g., San Francisco/Cleveland)\n   * In some districts, the pickup was concentrated in specific segments:\n     * \u201cBankers reported moderate growth in demand for residential mortgages\u2026 Business loan demand decreased slightly on net\u2026 Business loan rates moved down, but terms tightened. In the consumer sector, loan demand increased slightly, with a few contacts noting a pickup in mortgage refinancing.\u201d (Banking and Finance)\n     * Cleveland reported \u201can uptick in demand because of lower interest rates\u201d in **commercial construction and financial services**. (Cleveland District commentary)\n\n   * Other districts still saw **muted or flat overall loan growth** despite lower rates:\n     * \u201cOverall loan growth in the Sixth District was flat\u2026 Loan demand from both corporate borrowers and consumers was muted amid persistent economic uncertainty.\u201d (Atlanta, Transportation/Banking)\n     * \u201cLending activity was largely steady\u2026 Recent reductions in interest rates started to spur additional demand for loans, but borrowers remained cautious.\u201d (Financial Institutions, multiple districts)\n\n   **Net effect:** Lower rates generally loosened financial conditions and modestly increased loan demand across districts, but in some areas this effect was damped by borrower caution and tightened non\u2011price terms.\n\n2. **Housing and Residential Construction (weak or flat despite lower rates)**\n   * Several districts reported that **lower rates did not translate into strong housing activity**:\n     * \u201cHousing market activity remained weak\u2026 Foot traffic and sales continued to be choppy and lackluster despite the recent dip in mortgage rates.\u201d (Construction and Real Estate)\n     * In Dallas: \u201cLoan demand grew, but the housing market remained weak.\u201d (Dallas, Summary of Economic Activity)\n     * \u201cResidential real estate activity decreased somewhat\u2026 Demand for new [homes]\u2026 developers continued to offer incentives to buyers.\u201d (Real Estate and Construction, San Francisco)\n     * \u201cClosed sales of single-family homes were flat or down slightly overall\u2026 despite rising [inventories]\u2026 buyers became increasingly selective.\u201d (Residential Real Estate, Boston)\n   * Some micro\u2011patterns:\n     * One broker noted existing homeowners were \u201creluctant to sell and lose their lower mortgage interest rates,\u201d limiting turnover.

(Atlanta, Summary of Economic Activity)\n\n   **Net effect:** In rate\u2011sensitive durable goods and autos, **lower interest rates did not prevent modest declines in demand**; manufacturing and related consumer durable spending were generally flat to slightly weaker across districts.\n\n5. **Cross\u2011District Patterns in Transmission**\n   * **Where effects were strongest:**  \n     * Districts citing **direct rate\u2011linked increases in loan demand and financial\u2011sector activity** (e.g., Cleveland; Financial Services commentary in multiple districts).\n     * Some districts where **commercial construction** and **residential mortgage demand/refinancing** rose with lower rates.\n   * **Where effects were muted:**  \n     * Districts like **Dallas**: \u201cLoan demand grew, but the housing market remained weak.\u201d (Dallas)\n     * **San Francisco and Boston**: residential real estate activity decreased or was flat despite lower mortgage rates.

The agent\u2019s answer explicitly includes Cleveland\u2019s uptick in commercial construction and financial services, describes broader increases in loan demand/looser financial conditions (covering the Chicago point in substance even if not singled out by name), and notes Dallas housing remaining weak and Boston single-family sales flat/down.

In New York, nonprofits faced challenges from reduced federal benefit programs, with community health-care centers reporting financial strain. Manufacturing employment in Boston was mixed, with one firm shedding workers to offset tariff-related cost increases.",
      "answer": "The only clear linkage identified in the evidence is between cuts to federal grant funding and employment in education and healthcare:\n\n- Multiple Beige Book labor market reports state that \u201ccuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health-care sectors.\u201d (LaborMarkets, repeatedly cited in Findings 2\u20134) This directly attributes job losses in these sectors to reductions in federal grant funding.\n\n- A related nonprofit survey notes that \u201cfunding for their respective organizations decreased over the past six months\u201d and that \u201cthe nonprofit sector was not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants,\u201d indicating reduced hiring and staffing in nonprofit organizations reliant on federal funding. (CommunityConditions, Finding 4)\n\nFor other sectors:\n\n- Construction employment \u201cfaced headwinds amid the slowdown in CRE and residential development activity,\u201d but this is linked to broader real estate and demand conditions, not directly to federal funding changes. (RealEstateand Construction; ConstructionandRealEstate, Finding 2)\n\n- In energy, \u201chead counts dipped further \u2026 as companies continued to find ways to complete more wells in less time and with fewer people,\u201d which is attributed to productivity/efficiency changes, not to federal funding. (Labor Markets; Energy, Finding 2)\n\n- The evidence set explicitly does not provide usable data on trends in federal funding by major function (e.g., defense, healthcare, education, infrastructure, R&D) over time, nor on corresponding long-run sectoral employment series (Finding 1). As a result, no broader causal or correlational patterns between federal funding levels and employment can be established beyond the specific grant-cut examples above.\n\nIn sum, within the available evidence, the documented employment effect of federal funding changes is:  \n- Reduced federal grant funding \u21d2 layoffs and hiring reductions in education, healthcare, and grant-dependent nonprofits.  \nNo other sectoral employment changes are clearly tied to federal funding changes in the provided sources.",

This reflects consumers favoring more affordable or convenient eating\u2011out formats and trimming higher\u2011margin extras.\n\n2. **Categories with declines or softness**\n\n   * **Building material and garden equipment, furniture, electronics and appliance stores**  \n     *Performance:* \u201cBuilding material and garden equipment, furniture, and electronic and appliance stores saw lower sales\u201d (RetailSales).  \n     *Behavior pattern:* The broader context is that \u201cRetail sales fell during the reporting period\u201d and outlooks were pessimistic, with tariffs \u201cone of the primary drivers of uncertainty\u201d (RetailSales). This suggests that big\u2011ticket or home\u2011related categories are being deferred or reduced amid economic uncertainty and tariff\u2011related cost concerns, consistent with \u201cconsumer spending declined slightly\u201d and increased caution (ConsumerSpending).\n\n   * **More affordable goods across multiple consumer categories**  \n     *Performance:* \u201cConsumer goods reportedly softened, including for food products, beverages, clothing, and pet supplies\u201d (RetailTradeandServices).  \n     *Performance (price tier split):* \u201c\u2026retail sales of luxury goods and athletic footwear continued to perform well, while the demand for more affordable goods declined\u201d (RetailTradeandServices).  \n     *Behavior pattern:* Several passages point to \u201cheightened price sensitivity\u201d and lower-income households needing to be \u201cmore selective\u201d (Consumer Spending), as well as evidence of \u201crising food pantry services, and elevated credit card delinquency rates\u201d (Consumer Spending). The combination indicates a trade\u2011down/constraint pattern where many consumers cut back even on everyday and lower\u2011priced goods, focusing only on the best perceived value and sometimes substituting away.\n\n   * **General retail goods and unit volumes**  \n     *Performance:* \u201cRetail sales fell during the reporting period\u201d (RetailSales) and \u201cseveral retail stores reported a drop in unit sales\u201d (ConsumerSpending).  \n     *Behavior pattern:* This aligns with \u201coverall consumer spending \u2026 inched down in recent weeks\u201d (OverallEconomicActivity / Consumer Spending) and a \u201cslightly declined\u201d trend (ConsumerSpending). Consumers are buying fewer units overall, reflecting caution and volatility in household consumption under economic uncertainty and tariff/inflation pressures.\n\n   * **Travel-related categories (airlines, hotels, some tourism)**  \n     *Performance:* \u201cLeisure and hospitality sales were mixed, with softness in some travel-related categories, including airlines and hotels\u201d (Consumer Spending), and some tourism contacts reported weaker summer activity (RetailandTourism).  \n     *Behavior pattern:* At the same time, tourism reports show \u201ca widening gap in demand between luxury and budget-friendly accommodations, where overall growth was fueled almost entirely by the former\u201d (RetailandTourism). This indicates that while mainstream and budget travel weaken, higher\u2011end travel and experiences are relatively more resilient among higher\u2011income consumers.\n\n   * **Casual sit\u2011down restaurants**  \n     *Performance:* \u201cCasual sit-down restaurants reported a softening\u201d (Retail, Travel, and Tourism).  \n     *Behavior pattern:* This softening occurs alongside increased spending at fast food/fast casual/family dining and diners skipping desserts/alcohol (ConsumerSpending). The pattern suggests consumers are trading down within food\u2011away\u2011from\u2011home: choosing lower\u2011cost formats and cutting discretionary add\u2011ons.\n\n   * **Furniture store traffic**  \n     *Performance:* \u201cA furniture store saw less traffic\u201d (Retail, Travel,and Tourism).  \n     *Behavior pattern:* This aligns with the broader decline in furniture sales (RetailSales) and general consumer caution and softer big\u2011ticket demand under uncertainty (ConsumerSpending, RetailSales).\n\n3. **Non-discretionary sectors under margin pressure**\n\n   * **Health care; food and beverage (as retail categories)**  \n     *Performance:* \u201cHealth care and food and beverage margins [were squeezed] due to higher costs\u201d (RetailSales).  \n     *Behavior pattern:* Although the evidence does not state that sales volumes declined, these non\u2011discretionary areas are experiencing cost\u2011pressure. This is consistent with a backdrop of consumers being \u201cmore selective\u201d and \u201cprice sensitive\u201d (Consumer Spending), implying retailers in these essential categories cannot fully pass through higher costs without risking demand, resulting in margin compression.\n\n4. **Overall consumer behavior patterns reflected in these category shifts**\n\n   * **Slight overall spending decline and caution:**  \n     \u201cConsumer spending declined slightly\u201d and was \u201cslightly lower\u201d over multiple periods (Consumer Spending), with businesses \u201canxious\u201d about upcoming seasons (Consumer Spending). This underpins broad softening across many goods categories and big-ticket items.\n\n   * **Heightened price sensitivity and selectivity:**  \n     Multiple reports cite \u201cheightened price sensitivity\u201d and lower-income households needing to be \u201cmore selective\u201d and relying more on sales/deals (Consumer Spending). This explains declines in unit sales (ConsumerSpending) and softness in everyday consumer goods (RetailTradeandServices), along with trade\u2011down within restaurant and travel categories.\n\n   * **Income/segment bifurcation:**  \n     While middle\u2011income consumers are \u201cincreasingly cautious\u201d and using credit to maintain spending (Consumer Spending), upper\u2011income households continue to spend on \u201ctravel, events, and luxury services\u201d (Consumer Spending). This bifurcation is visible in luxury goods and athletic footwear doing well (RetailTradeandServices) and luxury accommodations fueling tourism growth (RetailandTourism) even as mainstream categories weaken.\n\n   * **Promotion- and incentive-driven buying:**  \n     The \u201crobust surge\u201d in EV sales \u201cahead of the expiration of the EV tax credit\u201d (ConsumerSpending) shows that incentives and deadlines can temporarily boost specific categories despite overall softness and consumer caution.\n\nIn sum, gains are concentrated in luxury goods, athletic footwear, incentivized EV sales, and lower\u2011priced restaurant formats, while declines or softness appear in building materials, garden equipment, furniture, electronics/appliances, many everyday affordable goods, casual sit\u2011down dining, and parts of travel. These shifts closely track reported consumer behavior: slightly lower and more volatile spending, strong price sensitivity and selectivity, and a clear split between constrained middle\u2011/lower\u2011income consumers and relatively resilient higher\u2011income spending.",

      "expected": "In Kansas City, while expectations for 2026 were optimistic, consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately, signaling stress among households. In Chicago, business loan demand decreased slightly on net with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity, while consumer loan demand increased slightly with a pickup in mortgage refinancing. In Dallas, loan demand grew overall. St. Louis reported banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions. Consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.",
      "answer": "Across Federal Reserve Districts, the reported contrast between consumer and business lending conditions was as follows:\n\n1. **Nationwide pattern (all districts, aggregate Beige Book evidence)**  \n   * Overall bank lending (excluding credit cards) **declined moderately**, driven by a **strong decline in commercial and industrial (C&I) lending** and a **modest decline in commercial real estate loans**\u2014both business-oriented categories.  \n   * At the same time, **consumer lending (excluding auto and credit cards) rose strongly**, with **home equity lines increasing moderately, auto loans rising modestly, and mortgages ticking up slightly**.  \n   * **Source:** Beige Book, Credit Conditions section.\n\n   This implies that, in aggregate across districts, **business lending was weakening while most forms of consumer lending were expanding or at least edging up**.\n\n2. **Districts where consumer and business trends clearly diverged**  \n   * In one district\u2019s Banking and Finance report, **small-to-medium sized banks** noted that:\n     * **Demand for consumer loans and commercial mortgages held steady**,  \n     * But **overall loan demand declined due to sagging demand for business loans**.  \n     * **Source:** Beige Book, Banking and Finance.\n\n   This indicates that in that district, **business loan demand weakened while consumer loan demand remained stable**, adding a regional example of the broader aggregate pattern.\n\n3. **Districts where both segments were similarly soft**  \n   * In the Sixth District (Transportation section), **overall loan growth was flat**, and **loan demand from both corporate borrowers and consumers was muted amid persistent economic uncertainty**.  \n   * **Source:** Beige Book, Transportation (Sixth District).\n\n   Here, there was **no major difference between consumer and business lending conditions**; both were subdued.\n\n4. **Conditions and standards across categories**  \n   * A Community and Regional Banking summary (system\u2011wide) reported that **district banks noted little to no change in loan demand and credit standards across categories**, implying **broadly similar credit standards for consumer and business loans**.  \n   * However, it also highlighted **moderate deterioration in consumer lending** and expected challenges for **lower\u2011income consumers or those in discretionary\u2011spending industries** as disposable incomes fall.  \n   * **Source:** Beige Book, Community and Regional Banking.\n\n   Thus, while **standards were reported as largely unchanged across categories**, **forward\u2011looking concern was more pronounced on the consumer side**, particularly for vulnerable households.\n\n5. **Interest rates and terms**  \n   * In one Banking and Finance report, **business loan demand decreased slightly on net**, **business loan quality declined modestly**, and **business loan rates moved down but terms tightened**.  \n   * In contrast, another Financial Services report noted that **credit standards and terms eased slightly for residential real estate loans while tightening continued for the remaining loan types**, which include business loans.  \n   * **Sources:** Beige Book, Banking and Finance; Beige Book, Financial Services.\n\n   Across the districts providing this detail, this suggests **business borrowing generally faced tighter non\u2011price terms than residential (household) real estate borrowing**, even where interest rates were declining.\n\n6. **Summary of consumer vs. business by district pattern**  \n   * **Aggregate and in at least one district:** business lending\u2014especially C&I\u2014**weakened**, while consumer lending (especially non\u2011auto, mortgages, and home equity) **held steady or rose**.  \n   * **In the Sixth District:** **both** consumer and business loan demand were **muted**, so conditions did not diverge much.  \n   * **Standards:** banks **generally reported little change in credit standards across loan categories**, but **tightening was more often noted on business/\u201cremaining\u201d loan types**, while **residential real estate standards eased slightly** in some districts.  \n   * **Risk outlook:** concerns about **future deterioration were more explicitly tied to consumer lending**, particularly for lower\u2011income borrowers, even though current stress in loan quality was noted on both sides (consumer and business).\n\nBecause the Beige Book evidence is mainly qualitative and district\u2011specific, it supports **district\u2011level variation around a common theme**: **relative strength or resilience in many forms of consumer lending versus weaker or more cautious conditions in business lending, with some districts reporting uniformly muted demand for both.**",

In Richmond, price growth remained moderate overall despite some pickup in price growth in the manufacturing sector. In Chicago, producer prices grew moderately with contacts reporting moderate nonlabor cost increases including energy and raw materials. Manufacturing contacts attributed some raw materials price increases to tariffs, suggesting tariffs disproportionately affected goods-producing sectors.",
      "answer": "Price pressures were higher and more dynamic in manufacturing than in services.\n\n- **Magnitude and direction of price changes**\n  - Manufacturing:\n    - Input prices for manufacturers \u201cgrew at a strong pace\u201d (Labor Markets, score: 0.38/0.37), with firms reporting higher costs for raw materials, utilities, and imported components such as semiconductor chips (Manufacturing and Other Business Activity; Prices, nonlabor input costs).\n    - Manufacturers saw a \u201cslight increase in prices received\u201d and \u201cprice growth picked up somewhat in manufacturing\u201d (Prices, score: 0.41; Summary of Economic Activity, score: 0.38).\n    - Price indexes for prices paid and received remained above historical averages (Prices, score: 0.37).\n  - Services:\n    - Service sector firms reported \u201cvirtually no change in price growth\u201d and \u201cprice pressures were subdued in services\u201d (Prices, score: 0.41; Dallas, score: 0.40).\n    - Overall year\u2011over\u2011year price growth in the economy was characterized as moderate, with services not showing the same pickup seen in manufacturing (Prices, score: 0.41; Summary of Economic Activity, score: 0.38).\n\n- **Key drivers of price pressures**\n  - Manufacturing:\n    - Tariffs are repeatedly cited as a major source of higher costs and stronger price pressures. Firms noted tariff\u2011driven increases in input costs, with \u201cselling prices increased slightly overall, while rising more sharply in the manufacturing sector due to the widespread impact of tariffs\u201d (Prices, score: 0.38; Dallas, score: 0.40).\n    - Manufacturers also reported higher costs for utilities and imported components, and some noted that tariff-related cost pass\u2011through was still ongoing and expected to continue into future periods (Prices, multiple excerpts).\n    - Manufacturing firms, in response, \u201cexpect selling price growth to accelerate to a strong pace over the next couple of quarters\u201d (Labor Markets, score: 0.38/0.37).\n  - Services:\n    - Service firms also faced some tariff\u2011related input cost pressures (Prices, score: 0.41), but the evidence notes that these had not generally translated into a noticeable acceleration of final service prices.\n    - Wage inflation in services \u201ccontinued to ease on balance,\u201d with wage increases typical of long\u2011run averages (Labor Markets, score: 0.34/0.36), though hospitality and tourism showed stronger wage increases (three\u2011quarters of firms reporting 3%+ wage gains; Labor Markets, score: 0.39). This did not show up as broad\u2011based service price acceleration in the cited surveys.\n\n- **Differences in trends and volatility**\n  - Manufacturing:\n    - Input price growth is described as \u201cstrong,\u201d with ongoing, elevated pressures and expectations of further selling price acceleration (Labor Markets, score: 0.38/0.37).\n    - Price growth in manufacturing \u201cpicked up somewhat,\u201d and tariff impacts on manufacturing prices are expected to continue into 2026 (Summary of Economic Activity; Prices, score: 0.35\u20130.38).\n  - Services:\n    - Service sector price growth remained broadly stable, with \u201cvirtually no change in price growth\u201d (Prices, score: 0.41).\n    - Fed District commentary characterizes service price pressures as \u201csubdued\u201d compared with \u201celevated\u201d pressures in manufacturing (Dallas, score: 0.40).\n\n**Overall comparative conclusion (scope: post\u2011COVID, roughly 2020\u20132024):**  \nAcross the cited surveys and District reports, manufacturing faced stronger and more elevated price pressures than services.

      "answer": "Based on the provided research, the answer can only be given in qualitative terms and for a limited set of indicators.\n\n1. **Key economic indicators tracked for the Chicago (Seventh) District**\n\n   The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\u2019s Seventh District, as reflected in its Beige Book \u201cSummary of Economic Activity,\u201d tracks and reports on the following indicators for the District (Finding 1):\n\n   * Employment  \n   * Wages  \n   * Prices  \n   * Consumer spending  \n   * Leisure travel  \n   * Home sales (residential real estate)  \n   * Commercial real estate  \n   * Transportation  \n   * Manufacturing  \n   * Agriculture (including farm income prospects)\n\n   Evidence: The Seventh District summary notes that \u201ceconomic activity in the Seventh District was little changed over the reporting period,\u201d and that the Beige Book reports for Federal Reserve districts, including the Seventh, consistently discuss \u201cemployment levels, wage growth, price increases, consumer spending, manufacturing activity, and real estate (both residential and commercial)\u201d (Finding 1; Seventh District Summary of Economic Activity).\n\n2. **How Seventh District conditions compared to national/regional trends**\n\n   The available evidence allows only a high-level, qualitative comparison:\n\n   * **Overall activity:**  \n     * Seventh District: \u201cEconomic activity in the Seventh District was little changed over the reporting period, and contacts sensed slightly [softening/improvement]; prospects for 2025 farm income were unchanged.\u201d (Finding 2; Seventh District Summary of Economic Activity)  \n     * Other districts / broader pattern: Several other Federal Reserve districts also reported \u201clittle changed\u201d or \u201cslightly down\u201d economic activity. For example, the Sixth District was \u201clittle changed\u201d (with flat employment and modest wage and price growth), and the Ninth District was \u201cslightly down\u201d (Finding 2).  \n     * **Comparison:** The Seventh District\u2019s \u201clittle changed\u201d overall activity was broadly in line with a general pattern across multiple districts of either \u201clittle changed\u201d or \u201cslightly down\u201d activity, rather than being an outlier (Finding 2).\n\n   * **Sector detail (relative positioning, not quantified):**  \n     The research snippets show that across districts, similar categories are monitored\u2014employment, wages, prices, consumer spending, manufacturing, and real estate (Findings 1 and 2). However, for the Seventh District specifically, only the following qualitative points are available:\n     * Overall Seventh District activity: \u201clittle changed\u201d (Finding 1, Finding 2).  \n     * Prospects for 2025 farm income in the Seventh District: \u201cunchanged\u201d (Finding 2).  \n\n     Other districts provide more sectoral detail (e.g., Sixth District: flat employment, modest wage growth, moderate price increases, somewhat lower consumer spending, softer leisure travel, declining home sales, unchanged commercial real estate, modestly lower transportation, slightly stronger manufacturing; Finding 2). These sectoral descriptions indicate the type of comparison that could be made, but comparable sector-by-sector qualitative detail for the Seventh District is not present in the provided excerpts.\n\n3. **National\u2011level indicators and data comparability**\n\n   * The research does not list specific national quantitative values (e.g., U.S. GDP growth rate, national unemployment rate, national inflation rate) or map them directly to Seventh District values (Finding 3).  \n   * Instead, it notes that:\n     * The Beige Book \u201ccharacterizes regional economic conditions and prospects\u201d using mostly qualitative information, gathered across all 12 districts, and this information \u201csupplements the data and analysis used by Federal Reserve economists\u201d (Finding 3).  \n     * District\u2011level GDP or similarly standardized macro data by Federal Reserve district are \u201cnot readily available in a standardized, quantitative format\u201d; the Beige Book is the primary district\u2011level source and is qualitative in nature (Finding 4).\n\n   **Implication for comparison:**  \n   * Because the Beige Book is qualitative and district\u2011level GDP and similar numerical data are not standardized by Federal Reserve district (Finding 4), the research does not support a detailed, indicator\u2011by\u2011indicator quantitative comparison (e.g., unemployment rate in the Seventh District vs. U.S. unemployment rate, GDP growth in the Seventh District vs. national GDP growth).  \n   * The only supported comparison is that the Seventh District\u2019s overall condition (\u201clittle changed\u201d) aligned with the general tone for several other districts and thus with the broader qualitative picture of the U.S. economy reflected in the Beige Book (Finding 2).\n\n4. **Limits of the findings**\n\n   * The research confirms the **types** of indicators tracked for the Seventh District (employment, wages, prices, consumer spending, leisure travel, home sales, commercial real estate, transportation, manufacturing, agriculture) and that overall conditions were \u201clittle changed\u201d with unchanged farm income prospects (Findings 1 and 2).  \n   * It also confirms that the Beige Book is qualitative and that standardized, district\u2011level macroeconomic data (especially GDP) are not readily available, limiting precise national\u2013district comparisons (Findings 3 and 4).  \n   * It does **not** provide numerical values or detailed, side\u2011by\u2011side Seventh District vs. U.S. indicators, so any more granular comparison would go beyond the evidence and cannot be given here.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer requires listing the key Chicago (Seventh) District indicator directions (consumer spending declined some; manufacturing demand declined modestly; employment flat; wages/benefits up modestly; prices rose moderately; financial conditions loosened slightly; construction/real estate increased slightly; farm income prospects unchanged) and explicitly comparing each to national trends (e.g., overall activity little changed nationally, consumer spending inched down nationally, etc.). The agent mostly lists categories of indicators tracked and only states that overall activity was \u201clittle changed\u201d and farm income prospects were unchanged, while explicitly saying it cannot provide indicator-by-indicator comparison. It omits several required sectoral and comparative points (consumer spending, manufacturing, employment, wages, prices, financial conditions, construction) and therefore does not answer the question as expected.",
