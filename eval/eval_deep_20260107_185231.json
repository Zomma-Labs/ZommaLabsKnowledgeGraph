      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "answer": "During the reported period, overall economic activity in the Twelfth Federal Reserve District (San Francisco) edged down slightly, according to the Beige Book\u2013style evidence for the San Francisco area: \u201coverall economic activity edged down slightly during the reported period.\u201d (San Francisco > Body)\n\nAcross key indicators within this period:\n\n- Employment levels in the San Francisco area were \u201clittle changed during the reported period.\u201d (San Francisco > Body)\n- Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate was \u201cmixed, with activity decreasing or remaining stable across those sectors during the reported period.\u201d (San Francisco > Body)\n- Conditions in consumer and business services were \u201cmixed during the reported period.\u201d (San Francisco > Body; Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > SummaryofEconomicActivity)\n- Prices in the San Francisco area \u201crose modestly during the reported period,\u201d similar to the prior period. (San Francisco > Body; Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Prices)\n\nThe findings do not provide quantified magnitudes, specific dates, or longer-run historical trajectories; they describe a recent reporting period in which activity softened slightly overall, with largely flat employment, mixed sectoral conditions, and modest price increases.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer states that Twelfth District (San Francisco) economic activity edged down slightly, and that retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable. The agent states overall activity edged down slightly and explicitly notes those same sectors were decreasing or stable. Extra details (employment, services, prices) do not contradict the expected answer.",

      "question": "What is the Beige Book?",
      "expected": "The Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication about current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It characterizes regional economic conditions and prospects based on a variety of mostly qualitative information, gathered directly from each District's sources.",
      "answer": "The Beige Book is a publication of the U.S. Federal Reserve System that describes current regional economic conditions and prospects across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts (Finding 1; \u201cWhat is the Beige Book?\u201d).\n\nIts primary function is to provide a qualitative summary of current economic activity, based on information gathered directly from each District\u2019s sources within the Federal Reserve Districts (Finding 1; \u201cWhat is the Beige Book?\u201d). The Beige Book is intended to characterize how economic conditions have changed since the last Beige Book report and to help identify emerging trends that may not be readily apparent in available quantitative economic data (Finding 1; \u201cWhat is the purpose of the Beige Book?\u201d; \u201cHow is the information used?\u201d).\n\nThe document carries the subtitle \u201cSummary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District,\u201d indicating that its content consists of narrative commentary on economic conditions in each of the 12 Districts (Finding 1; \u201cThe Beige Book\u201d).  \n\nThe findings provided do not specify the exact frequency with which the Beige Book is published.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The agent accurately defines the Beige Book as a Federal Reserve System publication describing current economic conditions and prospects across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts, and notes it is largely qualitative and based on information gathered from each District\u2019s sources. These points match the expected answer; extra details about trends and frequency do not contradict it.",

      "expected": "12 Federal Reserve Districts are covered in the Beige Book.",
      "answer": "The Beige Book covers economic conditions across **all 12 Federal Reserve Districts**.  \n\nThis is supported by findings stating that \u201cThe Beige Book characterizes regional economic conditions and prospects for the areas covered by the **12 Federal Reserve Districts**\u201d and that \u201cThe Beige Book covers economic conditions across the **12 Federal Reserve Districts**.\u201d",

      "question": "How did overall economic activity change according to the October 2025 Beige Book?",
      "expected": "Economic activity changed little on balance since the previous report, with three Districts reporting slight to modest growth in activity, five reporting no change, and four noting a slight softening.",
      "answer": "According to the national summary in the October 2025 Beige Book, overall economic activity:\n\n- **\u201cChanged little on balance since the previous report\u201d**, with:\n  - some Federal Reserve Districts reporting **slight to modest growth**,\n  - some reporting **no change**, and\n  - others reporting a **slight softening** of activity.  \n\nThis characterization is taken directly from the national \u201cOverall Economic Activity\u201d section:  \n> \u201cEconomic activity changed little on balance since the previous report, with some Districts reporting slight to modest growth, some reporting no change, and others reporting a slight softening.\u201d",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly states the qualitative summary that economic activity changed little on balance, and that Districts reported slight to modest growth, no change, or slight softening. However, it omits the key quantitative breakdown by number of Districts (three, five, and four) that is part of the expected answer.",

      "question": "Which districts reported slight to modest economic growth?",
      "expected": "Three districts reported slight to modest growth: Boston (First District), Philadelphia (Third District), and Richmond (Fifth District).",
      "answer": "Based on the findings, the following Federal Reserve Districts reported slight to modest economic growth (i.e., low, positive growth in overall activity or key components such as wages or loan volume) in the latest period:\n\n1. **Third District (Philadelphia)**\n   - \u201cEconomic activity in the Third District increased slightly after rising modestly in the prior period.\u201d (Philadelphia Summary of Economic Activity)\n\n2. **Fifth District (Richmond)**\n   - \u201cThe regional economy grew modestly in the Richmond region in recent weeks.\u201d (Richmond body)\n   - \u201cWage growth in the Fifth District remained moderate in the most recent period.\u201d (Richmond Labor Markets)\n\n3. **Sixth District (Atlanta)**\n   - \u201cWages in the Sixth District grew modestly.\u201d (Atlanta body)\n   - Wage growth described as \u201cmodest, in the one-to-three percent range\u201d for the District. (Atlanta Labor Markets)\n\n4. **Eleventh District (Dallas)**\n   - \u201cWage growth in the Eleventh District was modest over the reporting period.\u201d (Dallas Summary of Economic Activity)\n   - \u201cLoan volume in the Eleventh District rose modestly over the reporting period.\u201d (Dallas Summary of Economic Activity)\n\n5. **First District (Boston)**\n   - \u201cEconomic activity in the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston District ticked up overall, indicating a modest improvement in regional economic conditions.\u201d (Boston Summary of Economic Activity)\n   - The uptick was \u201cled by modest increases in consumer spending\u201d and \u201cmodest increases in manufacturing sales.\u201d (Boston Summary of Economic Activity)\n\nThese are the districts explicitly reported as having slight or modest economic growth in overall activity or key economic indicators in the cited materials.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is that three districts\u2014Boston (First), Philadelphia (Third), and Richmond (Fifth)\u2014reported slight to modest economic growth. The agent correctly includes these three, but it also adds Atlanta (Sixth) and Dallas (Eleventh) based on modest wage/loan growth rather than overall economic growth, which makes the response overinclusive and not strictly correct to the question as framed in the expected answer.",
