      "expected": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "graphrag_answer": "Economic activity in the Twelfth District (San Francisco) has faced significant challenges, particularly for small businesses and community support organizations. Reports indicate that small businesses are experiencing reduced demand, leading to increased loan delinquencies, business closures, and a depletion of savings. Specifically, small businesses have seen a rise in loan delinquencies, reflecting their difficulties in meeting debt obligations as revenues decline, and many are reducing operating hours to cope with financial strain (Data: Entities 1219, 554; Relationships 1053, 1054).\n\nCommunity support organizations are also under severe stress, facing increased demand for services while experiencing funding cuts that limit their operational capacity (Data: Entities 1218, 1301, 1302; Relationships 1051, 1052). This situation creates a feedback loop where the struggles of small businesses increase the demand for social support, while the weakened capacity of community organizations exacerbates the challenges faced by these businesses.\n\nOverall, the economic conditions in the Twelfth District are characterized by heightened vulnerability and financial strain, threatening both economic and social stability in the region (Data: Entities 1218, 1219; Relationships 1050).",

The system answer, however, focuses on the challenges faced by small businesses and community support organizations, discussing issues like reduced demand, loan delinquencies, and funding cuts. While it does mention economic difficulties, it does not specifically address the overall change in economic activity as described in the expected answer. \n\nKey facts from the expected answer that are missing in the system answer include: 1) the specific mention of economic activity edging down slightly, 2) the reference to retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate, and 3) the overall characterization of economic activity as slightly down rather than just facing challenges. \n\nThe system answer does not contradict the expected answer but fails to provide the specific details and overall assessment of economic activity that were required. Therefore, it is incomplete but not misleading. \n\nThus, the verdict is PARTIALLY_CORRECT because while the system answer discusses relevant economic challenges, it does not fully capture the expected details about the change in economic activity."

      "graphrag_answer": "According to the October 2025 Beige Book, overall economic activity showed signs of a slight decline, particularly within the Twelfth District, where there were modest decreases in production, trade, and consumption. This decline is attributed to significant downside risks, including the potential impact of a government shutdown, which could disrupt federal operations and undermine consumer and business confidence. Additionally, while some regions reported stability or slight increases in employment, the overall sentiment indicated caution among businesses, particularly in sectors like retail and transportation, where investment and activity levels were subdued. Overall, the economic outlook remains cautious, with expectations of modest growth tempered by various risks and uncertainties.",

The expected answer specifies that three Districts reported slight to modest growth, five reported no change, and four noted a slight softening. In contrast, the system answer emphasizes a decline, particularly in the Twelfth District, and discusses downside risks and caution among businesses, which is not aligned with the expected information. Therefore, the system answer contains a factual error regarding the overall change in economic activity, making it incorrect. \n\nThere are no minor differences in wording or phrasing that could be considered acceptable; the core information is fundamentally at odds with the expected answer.

Additionally, while loan growth remains flat, the overall economic conditions suggest stability, which can be interpreted as a sign of cautious optimism. \n\n2. **Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland**: Although overall business activity has remained flat, there is a general expectation among businesses for modest growth in the coming months, reflecting cautious optimism. \n\nThese observations highlight that while growth may not be robust, there are signs of positive movement in specific sectors within these districts.",

Additionally, there is softening demand for certain refined products and retail segments, which reflects challenges in consumer demand (Transportation sector experiences modest decline; Softening demand observed in refined products).\n\n2. **Twelfth District**: Small businesses are facing significant financial strain, characterized by increased loan delinquencies, business closures, and reduced operating hours, indicating a weakened economic condition (Small businesses are experiencing heightened financial vulnerability; The overall condition of both small businesses and community support organizations has weakened).\n\n3. **Third District**: Auto dealers reported a slight decline in activity, which may reflect broader consumer sentiment and economic confidence (Auto dealers in the Third District report a slight decline in activity).\n\nThese reports highlight the varying degrees of economic challenges faced across different sectors and districts.",

In New Hampshire, for instance, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston reported that consumers accelerated their purchases of electric vehicles to take advantage of these incentives before they expired, leading to a modest overall increase in auto sales in the state. This surge in demand for electric vehicles was directly linked to the timing of the tax credit expiration, highlighting the significant influence of government policy on consumer behavior and market trends (New Hampshire Electric Vehicle Auto Sales and Tax Credit Community). \n\nAdditionally, in upstate New York, auto dealers noted that the impending expiration of the federal EV tax credit was shaping consumer behavior and sales strategies, suggesting that similar dynamics were at play in that region as well (Auto Dealers and Market Dynamics: Margins, Inventory, and EV Incentives).",

They are particularly affected by economic pressures, leading to restrained consumption and a trend described as a 'middle-class recession.' This group is relying more heavily on credit to maintain their spending levels, indicating financial stress. Markdowns have been effective in driving purchasing activity among these households, suggesting that their spending is increasingly dependent on cost-saving opportunities (Community Reports). \n\nIn summary, lower- and middle-income households are adapting to economic uncertainty by prioritizing discounts and using credit to sustain their expenditures, reflecting their cautious approach to spending amidst rising prices and economic pressures.",

      "question": "What drove manufacturing demand in the Chicago District?",
      "expected": "Manufacturing demand declined modestly in late August and September. Steel orders were flat overall. Fabricated metals demand was unchanged on balance, as higher sales to a range of sectors was offset by lower sales to the construction and automotive industries. Machinery orders decreased moderately, driven by a decline in demand from the auto sector. Auto production was down modestly, while heavy truck production was flat.",
      "graphrag_answer": "Manufacturing demand in the Chicago District was driven by mixed performance across various subsectors, with notable resilience in the machinery sector, which showed improving sales in certain regions like the Eleventh District and New York District. However, overall demand was tempered by a decline in new orders, indicating a potential slowdown in manufacturing activity. Additionally, manufacturers faced elevated uncertainty and higher input costs due to tariffs, which constrained capacity utilization and influenced business decisions. This environment of uncertainty, combined with soft capital spending plans and worsening supply availability, contributed to a cautious outlook among manufacturers in the region.",

      "expected": "Several manufacturers noted that changing tariff policies were making it difficult to plan for the future.",
      "graphrag_answer": "Manufacturers faced several challenges regarding tariff policies, primarily related to increased costs and operational uncertainties. Key challenges included:\n\n1. **Rising Input Costs**: Tariffs significantly increased the costs of raw materials, imported components, and finished goods. This led to higher operating expenses for manufacturers across various sectors, including auto manufacturing and steel production (Community Reports, Tariffs and Supply Chain Cost Pressures).\n\n2. **Cost Pass-Through to Consumers**: Many manufacturers, particularly smaller ones, were compelled to pass these increased costs onto consumers, resulting in higher prices for consumer goods and manufacturing inputs. This contributed to inflationary pressures and reduced consumer purchasing power (Community Reports, Suppliers Respond to Tariff-Induced Pressures by Raising Prices; Cost Increases Passed Through to Customers by Smaller Manufacturers).\n\n3. **Uncertainty in Business Planning**: The unpredictability surrounding the timing and scope of tariffs complicated business planning and inventory management. Manufacturers had to adjust their strategies, including production and sourcing decisions, to navigate this uncertainty (Community Reports, Tariffs Introduce Strategic and Operational Uncertainty for Businesses).\n\n4. **Weakening Demand**: The increased costs and uncertainty led to weaker demand for manufactured goods, as businesses and consumers became more cautious. This was particularly evident in sectors like automotive, where manufacturers reported underperformance in shipments (Community Reports, Auto Manufacturers Face Rising Costs and Weakened Demand).\n\n5. **Dwindling Inventories of Pre-Tariff Goods**: As inventories of goods acquired before tariffs were depleted, manufacturers faced heightened exposure to the higher costs associated with new, tariff-affected goods. This transition added pressure to adjust pricing strategies (Community Reports, Dwindling Inventories of Pre-Tariff Goods Add to Uncertainty).\n\n6. **Strategic Adjustments**: Manufacturers had to make significant adjustments in their sourcing, production, and pricing strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs. This included reevaluating supply chains and seeking alternative sources for inputs (Community Reports, Tariffs Necessitate Strategic Adjustments in Sourcing, Production, and Pricing).\n\nOverall, the imposition of tariffs created a complex environment for manufacturers, characterized by increased costs, strategic challenges, and weakened demand.",

The residential real estate market is shifting towards a more balanced state, with increased housing inventory and subdued demand, particularly for starter homes. This trend indicates a transition from a seller's market to a more balanced one, reflecting broader economic conditions and buyer preferences.

      "graphrag_answer": "Lower interest rates have generally spurred increased loan demand, particularly for business lending, as they reduce borrowing costs. This trend is evident in regions like Memphis, where lower rates have led to improved business lending activity, indicating that businesses are taking advantage of favorable borrowing conditions to finance expansion and operations (Financial Services, Loan Demand, and Interest Rate Dynamics Community).\n\nHowever, despite the potential for increased borrowing due to lower interest rates, a cautious \"sideline mentality\" among borrowers has emerged, driven by ongoing economic uncertainty. This has resulted in a notable impact on overall loan demand, as businesses and individuals are delaying new loans or financial commitments (Borrowers and Loan Demand Dynamics Community). Consequently, while lower interest rates typically encourage borrowing, the prevailing uncertainty has led to a decrease in actual loan demand, reflecting a complex interplay between interest rates and borrower sentiment.\n\nAdditionally, the tightening of loan terms by lenders in response to reduced demand further complicates the situation. Tighter terms can dampen demand even more, creating a feedback loop that constrains business growth and economic expansion (Business Loan Demand, Acquisition Activity, and Terms Community). Overall, while lower interest rates have the potential to stimulate business activity, the current economic climate has led to a cautious approach among borrowers, limiting the effectiveness of these lower rates in driving increased business activity.",

The system answer does mention increased loan demand for business lending due to lower interest rates, which aligns with the expected answer. However, it introduces a contrasting narrative about a 'sideline mentality' among borrowers, suggesting that despite lower rates, there is a decrease in actual loan demand due to economic uncertainty. This introduces a contradiction to the expected answer, which does not mention any decrease in demand or a cautious approach among borrowers. The system answer also discusses tighter loan terms and their impact on demand, which is not part of the expected answer. Therefore, while the system answer contains some accurate information, it ultimately contradicts the expected answer by implying that lower interest rates are not effectively driving increased business activity due to borrower caution.

      "graphrag_answer": "Nonprofits in the New York District are facing several significant challenges:\n\n1. **Funding Instability**: There has been a notable decrease in funding, particularly due to reductions and unpredictability in federal grants and benefit programs. This funding decline is a primary driver of operational strain, forcing nonprofits to reduce hiring and dip into reserve funds for the first time in over a decade (Community Reports).\n\n2. **Rising Costs**: Nonprofits are experiencing increased insurance premiums and other nonlabor costs, which are straining their budgets. These rising expenses are reducing financial flexibility and threatening long-term viability (Community Reports).\n\n3. **Staffing Shortages**: Due to financial pressures and uncertainty, many nonprofits are not filling open positions, leading to workforce shortages at a time when demand for services is elevated. This mismatch between community needs and organizational capacity poses risks to service quality (Community Reports).\n\n4. **Elevated Demand for Services**: There is a heightened demand for social services, driven by broader economic challenges, which is straining the limited resources of nonprofits. This gap between rising community needs and the capacity of nonprofits to respond is widening (Community Reports).\n\n5. **Depletion of Reserve Funds**: Nonprofits are using reserve funds to cover operating expenses, which is unsustainable in the long term and undermines their resilience to future financial shocks (Community Reports).\n\n6. **Seeking Alternative Revenue Streams**: In response to funding challenges, nonprofits are actively exploring alternative revenue sources to diversify income and reduce reliance on traditional funding mechanisms (Community Reports).\n\nThese interconnected challenges threaten the sustainability and effectiveness of nonprofit organizations in the New York District, impacting their ability to serve vulnerable populations effectively.",

They noted a period of flat demand and only modest growth expectations, indicating a cautious outlook among logistics providers. Additionally, the pre-tariff import surge led to a temporary spike in freight activity, but the lasting effects have resulted in ongoing operational adjustments that continue to influence the dynamics of the freight sector. In contrast, the airport community is experiencing significant declines in both passenger and cargo volumes, which poses operational and financial risks for the airport and its stakeholders. Overall, the transportation activity reflects a mixed environment, with the freight sector showing modest growth and the airport sector facing declines.",

      "expected": "In some cases, employers cited increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies as a reason for lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition.",
      "graphrag_answer": "The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted employment decisions by driving head count reductions and contributing to a hiring chill across various sectors. Specifically, generative AI technologies have been linked to increased layoffs as organizations automate tasks previously performed by human employees, leading to a contraction in workforce size. This relationship is well-documented, indicating a clear causal link between AI adoption and workforce reductions (Community Reports, Generative AI-Driven Workforce Shifts).\n\nMoreover, the implementation of AI has not only resulted in layoffs but has also contributed to a slowdown in hiring activity. Firms are increasingly opting for technology over expanding their human workforce, which exacerbates the overall decline in employment opportunities (Community Reports, Generative AI is a primary driver of head count reductions). This dual effect of reducing current staff and slowing future hiring creates a feedback loop that accelerates workforce transformation, with significant implications for the labor market (Community Reports, The feedback loop between generative AI, layoffs, and hiring freezes may accelerate workforce transformation).\n\nIn summary, AI has led to both direct job losses and a strategic shift in hiring practices, resulting in fewer new positions being created or filled, thereby impacting overall employment levels negatively (Community Reports, A hiring chill is compounding the effects of workforce reductions).",

Overall, manufacturing in declining districts was flat to slightly moderating.",
      "graphrag_answer": "In districts where economic activity declined, manufacturing experienced notable challenges, including staff reductions and decreased demand. Specifically, the Twelfth District reported staff reductions in both manufacturing and health care sectors, implemented through attrition, layoffs, and early retirements, indicating a systemic trend affecting workforce levels (Community Reports). Additionally, manufacturers faced increased input costs due to tariffs and weak demand, leading to a decline in new orders and overall production challenges (U.S. Manufacturing Sector and Trade Policy Dynamics). For instance, manufacturers in regions like Kentucky and Tennessee reported decreased sales and a downturn in new business inquiries, reflecting broader economic pressures (U.S. Manufacturing Sector and Policy Impacts).

(2) Philadelphia - manufacturers reported increased cost pressures from tariffs and some tariff-related onshoring, while contacts noted disruptions from immigration policies including vacated positions due to visa status changes and decline in foreign-born workers in construction. (3) Atlanta - concerns over tariffs remained prevalent among manufacturers, while immigration policy impacts were more material than previously reported in agriculture and hospitality sectors. (4) Chicago - manufacturing contacts attributed metals price increases to tariffs, while contacts noted fear of immigration enforcement was reducing labor availability and revoked visas created rehiring needs. (5) St. Louis - contacts reported managing tariffs as a cost factor, while immigration policies resulted in labor shortages with workers in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture not reporting to work due to fears of deportation. (6) San Francisco - higher import duties led to cost increases for raw materials and electronic components used in manufacturing, while contacts in construction and manufacturing noted difficulty finding entry-level workers attributed to reduced immigration.",
      "graphrag_answer": "The districts that mentioned both tariff impacts on manufacturing and labor shortages from immigration policies are the **Third District** and the **U.S. Manufacturing Sector and Policy Impacts** community. \n\n1. **Third District**: The reports indicate that the construction industry is sensitive to labor availability, particularly foreign-born workers, which is influenced by immigration policies. Additionally, manufacturing activity in this district has been challenged by increased input costs due to tariffs and weak demand, highlighting the dual impact of tariffs and immigration policies on labor shortages and manufacturing (e.g., \"Labor shortages, exacerbated by restrictive immigration policies\" and \"Manufacturing activity in the Third District has been challenged by increased input costs due to tariffs\").\n\n2. **U.S. Manufacturing Sector and Policy Impacts**: This community explicitly discusses the impact of tariffs on manufacturing, stating that \"Tariffs have had a pronounced impact on the manufacturing sector, increasing input costs and weakening demand.\" While it does not directly mention immigration policies, the broader context of labor challenges in manufacturing can be inferred, especially as labor shortages are a common theme across various reports.\n\nThus, both communities reflect the interconnectedness of tariff impacts on manufacturing and labor shortages influenced by immigration policies.",

      "graphrag_answer": "In the New York District, domestic lumber prices saw decreases due to declining construction activity, which led to reduced demand for construction materials. Builders were able to negotiate lower prices for domestic lumber as a result of increased availability and falling sales in the construction market (source: Builders, Contractors, and Construction Materials in the New York District).\n\nIn the Kansas City District, similar trends were observed, indicating a broader national or regional market softening for construction materials, including price declines (source: Construction Materials Market Softening Extends Beyond New York). \n\nOverall, the price decreases in construction materials, particularly domestic lumber, were primarily caused by a significant decline in construction activity and reduced demand, allowing builders to leverage the situation for better pricing (source: Improved Availability and Declining Prices of Construction Materials).",

In the same district, nonresidential construction increased slightly and commercial real estate activity also increased slightly. The Cleveland (Fourth) District noted that commercial construction and financial services contacts saw an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates.",
      "graphrag_answer": "In districts where financial conditions loosened, real estate activity generally experienced subdued performance. Reports indicate a general decrease in residential real estate activity, characterized by declining home sales and increased housing inventory. For instance, the residential real estate sector is noted to have \"flat or lower\" home sales overall, with some areas experiencing slow markets and declining house prices. The shift from a seller's market to a more balanced market in single-family homes reflects this trend, as increased inventory and subdued demand reduce sellers' leverage (Data: Entities 26, 104, 735).\n\nMoreover, while the luxury new home market showed some resilience, the entry-level segment faced persistently muted demand, which significantly impacted overall sales figures (Data: Entities 650, 651). The overall decline in home sales, particularly in the starter home segment, suggests that even in districts with looser financial conditions, real estate activity did not see a corresponding increase, highlighting the complex interplay between financial conditions and market dynamics.",

      "expected": "Higher-income individuals maintained strong spending on luxury travel and accommodation. Lower- and middle-income households sought discounts and promotions due to rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. This bifurcation was driven by rising prices eroding purchasing power for lower/middle-income groups while higher-income groups remained insulated.",
      "graphrag_answer": "Consumer spending patterns varied significantly between income groups, primarily driven by economic pressures and credit reliance. \n\n1. **Middle-Income Consumers**: This group is increasingly cautious and has been described as experiencing a \"middle-class recession.\" They are heavily reliant on credit to maintain their spending levels amid rising prices and economic uncertainty. Their cautious behavior is reflected in their search for discounts and promotions, indicating a heightened price sensitivity (Community Reports).\n\n2. **Lower-Income Households**: Similar to middle-income consumers, lower-income households are also price-sensitive and actively seek markdowns and promotions to stimulate purchasing activity. This behavior is driven by economic uncertainty and the need to manage limited financial resources (Community Reports).\n\n3. **Upper-Income Households**: In contrast, mid- to upper-income consumers have demonstrated resilience, maintaining or even increasing their expenditures. This group continues to spend on discretionary items such as travel and luxury services, which supports specific sectors of the economy (Community Reports). Their financial stability allows them to be less affected by economic fluctuations compared to lower-income groups.\n\nOverall, the differences in consumer spending patterns are largely driven by economic pressures, credit reliance, and varying levels of financial stability across income groups. Middle- and lower-income consumers are more affected by economic uncertainties, leading to cautious spending and a reliance on credit, while upper-income households continue to drive growth in consumer spending due to their financial resilience.",

      "graphrag_answer": "The Beige Book reports indicate a clear relationship between AI investment and employment trends, characterized by significant workforce reductions and a hiring chill. Increased investment in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, is directly linked to head count reductions as firms automate tasks previously performed by human workers. This trend has led to layoffs and a decrease in the need for certain job roles, contributing to a broader contraction in employment levels across various sectors (e.g., professional services and restaurants) [Data: Entities (548, 584); Relationships (577)].\n\nMoreover, the adoption of AI technologies is not only resulting in job losses but is also causing firms to adopt more cautious hiring practices, leading to fewer head count additions and a stagnation in workforce numbers.

These changes have led to:\n\n1. **Funding Instability**: Nonprofits are facing acute funding declines due to cuts and unpredictability in federal grants and benefit programs. This has resulted in operational challenges, including staffing shortages and the inability to meet community needs (Community Reports, New York District Nonprofits).\n\n2. **Increased Demand for Services**: Despite the funding cuts, there has been a surge in demand for social services, which has strained the already limited resources of nonprofits. This mismatch between rising community needs and reduced capacity has raised concerns about unmet needs among vulnerable populations (Community Reports, Nonprofits face acute funding instability).\n\n3. **Staffing Challenges**: Many nonprofits have been forced to reduce their workforce due to financial pressures, making it difficult to fill open positions. This staffing shortage undermines their ability to respond effectively to the increased demand for services (Community Reports, Staffing shortages are undermining the capacity of nonprofits).\n\n4. **Financial Distress Among Service Users**: The reductions in federal benefits have also led to heightened financial distress among populations served by nonprofits, such as Medicaid patients, limiting their access to necessary health-care services (Community Reports, Medicaid patients are experiencing heightened financial distress).\n\n5. **Exploration of Alternative Revenue Streams**: In response to these challenges, nonprofits are actively seeking alternative revenue sources to sustain their operations. This shift, while necessary, introduces new complexities and risks (Community Reports, Nonprofits are actively seeking alternative revenue streams).\n\nOverall, the interconnectedness of funding cuts, staffing shortages, and increased demand for services creates a systemic risk for nonprofits, threatening their sustainability and the well-being of the communities they serve (Community Reports, The interconnectedness of funding, staffing, and service demand creates systemic risk).",

      "expected": "Responses to tariff-induced costs varied by sector: In manufacturing and retail trades, some firms fully passed higher import costs along to customers. Other firms facing tariff-induced cost pressures kept selling prices largely unchanged to preserve market share and due to pushback from price-sensitive clients. In Chicago, a retail industry analyst expected peak tariff impact in the first half of 2026.",
      "graphrag_answer": "Firms across various sectors have responded to tariff-induced cost increases primarily through price pass-through strategies, where they transfer the increased costs to consumers by raising prices. This practice has been widely adopted as a mechanism to cope with the financial pressures imposed by tariffs, which have significantly increased operating costs.\n\n1. **General Response**: Many firms, regardless of industry, have engaged in negotiations with suppliers to manage rising costs and have often passed these costs onto customers. This is evident in the reports indicating that \"price pass-through is a common response to tariff-induced cost increases\" (Tariff Impacts Community).\n\n2. **Manufacturing and Retail**: In the manufacturing and retail sectors, suppliers have raised their prices due to tariff pressures, which has led manufacturers and retailers to adjust their pricing strategies accordingly. Smaller manufacturers, in particular, have been noted for directly passing on these increased costs to their customers, contributing to higher prices for consumer goods (Tariffs and Supply Chain Cost Pressures in Manufacturing and Retail).\n\n3. **Auto Industry**: Auto manufacturers have faced increased costs for imported components and raw materials due to tariffs. They have had to absorb some of these costs to maintain demand while also passing some onto consumers, resulting in weaker-than-expected auto shipments (Tariffs and Supply Chain Cost Pressures in Manufacturing and Retail).\n\n4. **Steel Producers**: In contrast, steel producers have opted to hold their prices steady despite rising costs and slower demand, indicating a more cautious approach to pricing in an effort to preserve margins (Tariffs and Supply Chain Cost Pressures in Manufacturing and Retail).\n\n5. **Foreign Producers**: In response to U.S. tariffs, foreign producers have cut prices to retain market share, which reflects a competitive adjustment to the cost pressures faced by U.S. firms (Tariffs and Supply Chain Cost Dynamics Community).\n\nOverall, the trend indicates that while many firms are passing costs onto consumers, the strategies vary by sector, with some opting to absorb costs or hold prices steady to maintain competitiveness.

However, in the Chicago District, light vehicle sales declined overall, especially for EVs following the end of federal tax credits. This shows the federal tax credit created a pre-expiration demand surge followed by a post-expiration decline.",
      "graphrag_answer": "The relationship between federal policy and electric vehicle (EV) sales is primarily driven by the federal tax credits, which have significantly influenced consumer behavior in New Hampshire. The impending expiration of these tax credits has led to a notable increase in electric vehicle purchases as consumers rushed to take advantage of the incentives before they lapsed. This surge in EV sales has modestly boosted overall auto sales in the state, indicating that government policy can have a direct impact on market trends and consumer decisions (New Hampshire Electric Vehicle Auto Sales and Tax Credit Community).\n\nSpecifically, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston reported that the expiration of federal tax credits acted as a catalyst for increased EV purchases, which in turn contributed to a modest uptick in overall auto sales (New Hampshire Electric Vehicle Auto Sales and Tax Credit Community). This relationship underscores the significant influence of federal policy on consumer behavior, particularly in the electric vehicle segment, which is characterized by evolving preferences and responsiveness to financial incentives (Auto Dealers and Market Dynamics: Margins, Inventory, and EV Incentives).\n\nIn summary, the expiration of federal tax credits has driven up electric vehicle sales, leading to a modest increase in overall auto sales, highlighting the critical role of federal policy in shaping market dynamics.",

Additionally, some contacts in the Chicago District reported moderate increases in nonlabor costs including energy and higher prices for raw materials. This meant total compensation costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.",
      "graphrag_answer": "Labor costs are influenced by several interrelated factors, primarily wage growth, employer-sponsored health insurance expenses, and labor shortages. \n\n1. **Wage Growth**: Wages have seen modest to moderate growth across various sectors, contributing directly to increased labor cost pressures for employers. Even slight wage increases can significantly impact overall labor costs, especially when combined with other rising expenses (Data: Entities (39, 40); Relationships (84)).\n\n2. **Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance Expenses**: There have been outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance costs, which represent a significant component of labor costs. These rising expenses intensify labor cost pressures, as employers strive to maintain competitive benefits while managing escalating healthcare costs (Data: Entities (41, 40, 105); Relationships (54, 87, 88)).\n\n3. **Labor Shortages**: Labor shortages, particularly in sectors like construction and manufacturing, exacerbate wage pressures as employers compete for a limited pool of workers. This competition drives up wages, which in turn increases labor cost pressures, creating a feedback loop where rising costs and shortages reinforce each other (Data: Entities (80, 39, 40); Relationships (84)).\n\n4. **Immigration Policies**: Changes in immigration policies have contributed to labor shortages, further complicating the labor market dynamics. Restrictions on the supply of skilled and unskilled workers can lead to increased costs and reduced industry growth, impacting wage dynamics (Data: Relationships (83); Entities (80)).\n\n5. **Sector-Specific Variations**: The degree of wage growth and labor cost pressures varies significantly across sectors. Industries like construction and manufacturing are particularly sensitive to labor shortages and wage competition, leading to higher operational costs (Data: Entities (39, 80)).\n\nIn summary, the interaction of these factors creates a complex environment where rising labor costs are driven by modest wage growth, significant increases in health insurance expenses, and acute labor shortages, all of which are influenced by sector-specific dynamics and immigration policies. This interconnectedness poses operational and financial challenges for employers, necessitating strategic responses to manage costs effectively.",

This trend indicates that consumers are prioritizing cost-effectiveness in their dining choices, leading to a shift in demand towards more affordable dining options.\n\n2. **Impact of Economic Uncertainty**: Economic pressures, such as rising prices and concerns about tariffs, have led to a cautious approach among consumers, particularly affecting discretionary spending in restaurants. This has resulted in a decline in demand from international travelers, while domestic consumer demand has remained stable.\n\n3. **Luxury Spending Resilience**: Despite broader economic challenges, higher-income individuals continue to spend robustly on luxury dining experiences. This segment's sustained demand provides a buffer for upscale restaurants, allowing them to maintain profitability even as other segments face declines.\n\n4. **Price Sensitivity Among Lower-Income Consumers**: Lower- and middle-income households are increasingly seeking discounts and promotions, which has led to a greater reliance on markdowns to stimulate purchasing activity.

      "graphrag_answer": "Lower interest rates have had a significant impact on various interest rate-sensitive sectors across districts, primarily by increasing loan demand from both households and businesses. \n\n1. **Financial Services Sector**: The financial services sector has seen increased loan demand attributed to lower interest rates, with stable core deposit levels and delinquency rates. This indicates a resilient sector that is effectively supporting economic growth (Financial Services, Loan Demand, and Interest Rate Dynamics Community).\n\n2. **Business Lending**: In certain districts, lower interest rates have improved business lending, suggesting that businesses are taking advantage of favorable borrowing conditions to finance expansion and operations. For instance, commercial loan demand has been particularly strong in Memphis, despite some tightening of lending standards (Financial Services Sector as a Central Economic Pillar; Banking Sector Credit Conditions and Lending Standards - Memphis Focus).\n\n3. **Household Borrowing**: Households have also responded positively to lower interest rates, with increased demand for loans reflecting their willingness to borrow. This trend is crucial for economic activity, as it indicates confidence among consumers (Households as Key Economic Actors).\n\n4. **Regional Variations**: However, the impact of lower interest rates has not been uniform across all regions. For example, while the Kansas City District reported stable loan demand, the Second District experienced declines. This highlights the sensitivity of loan demand to local economic conditions and the need for regionally tailored financial strategies (Regional and Sectoral Variations in Loan Demand).\n\n5. **Residential Real Estate**: In the residential real estate market, lower mortgage rates are expected to shift demand from rentals to home purchases, potentially reducing rental demand and improving home affordability. This dynamic is crucial as it influences both the housing market and broader economic conditions (New York District Housing Market Dynamics).\n\nOverall, lower interest rates have generally spurred increased borrowing and lending activity across various sectors, although the effects vary by region and sector, reflecting local economic conditions and specific market dynamics.",

This strategy, while preserving short-term market share, threatens long-term profitability and financial stability (Community Reports, Auto Manufacturers and Tariff-Impacted Shipments).\n\n2. **Underperformance in Port Shipments**: Shipments of automobiles through ports have been reported as below expectations, indicating logistical challenges that may stem from supply chain disruptions, decreased demand, or operational inefficiencies. This underperformance creates bottlenecks that exacerbate financial and operational challenges for manufacturers (Community Reports, Auto Manufacturers and Tariff-Impacted Shipments).\n\n3. **Cascading Effects on the Supply Chain**: The imposition of tariffs has not only impacted manufacturers but also affected suppliers and logistics providers, leading to reduced orders for parts and materials. This cascading effect disrupts delivery schedules and inventory management throughout the supply chain (Community Reports, Tariffs have a cascading effect on the entire automotive supply chain).\n\n4. **Rising Input Costs**: Tariffs have led to increased costs for raw materials and imported components across various manufacturing sectors, including automotive and steel. These rising input costs have forced manufacturers to adjust pricing strategies, often passing costs onto consumers, which can lead to reduced demand and operational challenges (Community Reports, Tariffs and Supply Chain Cost Pressures in Manufacturing and Retail).\n\n5. **Operational and Financial Pressures**: The combination of rising costs and underperforming shipments has created significant operational and financial pressures within the manufacturing sector, leading to a cautious outlook among manufacturers and potential declines in production (Community Reports, U.S. Manufacturing, Tariffs, and Trade Policy Community).\n\nOverall, these supply chain disruptions have led to increased costs, reduced demand, and operational inefficiencies, significantly impacting production in the manufacturing sector.",

      "question": "What service-related costs contributed to input cost increases, and how did this affect different sectors?",
      "expected": "Several service-related costs drove input cost increases: insurance, health care, and technology solutions all saw higher costs. In New York, rising business costs including insurance added to financial pressures for community service providers. Employer-sponsored health insurance expenses saw outsized increases, intensifying labor cost pressures across districts. These service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.",
      "graphrag_answer": "Rising health-care costs have significantly contributed to increased input costs across various sectors, particularly affecting the Nonfinancial Services and Health Care sectors. Specifically, the health care industry is facing challenges due to escalating expenses related to labor market conditions and ongoing wage negotiations, which have directly impacted the cost structure of health care providers. This increase in health-care costs has led to higher input costs for businesses, influencing their pricing, hiring, and investment decisions (Community Reports, \"Rising Health-Care Costs Drive Up Input Costs for Businesses\").\n\nAdditionally, labor market pressures, including difficulties in finding workers and strong wage growth, have also contributed to rising costs in the Leisure and Hospitality sectors, further exacerbating input cost challenges (Community Reports, \"Labor Market Pressures Are a Common Challenge Across Multiple Sectors\"). The interconnectedness of these sectors means that rising health-care costs not only impact the health care industry but also increase input costs for businesses across the broader Nonfinancial Services sector (Community Reports, \"Sectoral Interconnections Amplify Community-Wide Impacts\"). \n\nOverall, the rising costs in health care and labor are creating financial pressures that affect operational stability and growth prospects across multiple sectors, highlighting the need for ongoing monitoring and adaptive strategies (Community Reports, \"Uncertainty About Future Growth Persists Across the Community\").",

      "expected": "In Chicago, leisure and hospitality sales were mixed. Categories seeing gains included restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments, as well as new light vehicle sales which were brisk due to strong underlying demand and the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases. Categories seeing softness included travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels. Used vehicle sales remained steady though dealerships in low-to-moderate income communities reported softer demand. This pattern reflects consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.",
      "graphrag_answer": "In the recent Beige Book economic reports, retail categories exhibited mixed performance, with notable gains in essential goods sectors and declines in durable goods sectors. \n\n**Gains:**\n1. **Health Care Retailers**: Reported stable to slight increases in sales, indicating resilience in the essential goods sector. This suggests that consumer demand for health-related products remains consistent, even amid broader retail declines (Data: Entities 1111).\n2. **Food and Beverage Retailers**: Also saw flat to slight increases in sales, reflecting steady demand for essential consumables, which consumers prioritize regardless of economic fluctuations (Data: Entities 1112).\n3. **Apparel**: A department store in the Second District reported strengthening sales in apparel, attributed to increased consumer spending, indicating a positive trend in this category (Data: Entities 255).\n\n**Declines:**\n1. **Building Materials and Garden Equipment Stores**: Experienced reduced sales, likely due to decreased consumer demand influenced by economic uncertainty and higher interest rates (Data: Entities 1108).\n2. **Furniture Stores**: Reported lower sales, reflecting a trend of consumers postponing large purchases amid economic uncertainty (Data: Entities 1109).\n3. **Electronic and Appliance Stores**: Saw a decline in sales, suggesting reduced discretionary spending as consumers become more cautious (Data: Entities 1110).\n\n**Consumer Behavior Patterns**: The overall decline in retail sales, particularly in durable goods sectors, indicates a shift in consumer behavior towards prioritizing essential goods over discretionary purchases. This trend is likely driven by economic uncertainty, inflation, and changing household budgets, as consumers exhibit increased price sensitivity and adaptability in their spending habits (Data: Entities 239). The mixed performance across retail subsectors underscores divergent consumer priorities, with essential goods maintaining stability while discretionary categories face challenges.",

      "expected": "Energy sector performance varied significantly: In Atlanta (Sixth District), energy grew moderately - a positive outlier. In Dallas (Eleventh District), drilling and well completion activity was flat. Nationally, energy activity was generally down among reporting districts. The Chicago District noted higher energy prices as part of nonlabor cost increases affecting manufacturers.",
      "graphrag_answer": "Energy sector performance varied significantly across districts, with notable activities highlighted in the reports:\n\n1. **Sixth District (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta)**:\n   - **Crude Oil Production**: The Gulf of Mexico reported strong crude oil production, contributing positively to the regional economy. This robust output contrasts with stagnation in drilling and well completion activities due to low oil prices and rising breakeven costs.\n   - **Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Exports**: There was moderate expansion in energy activity, particularly in LNG exports, which remained robust and supported global demand. This sector is crucial for the region's economic resilience.\n   - **Refined Products**: There was a noted softening demand for refined products, indicating challenges within this segment of the energy market.\n\n2. **Cleveland District**:\n   - **Data Center Construction**: The construction of data centers has significantly driven demand for energy, particularly fossil fuels and electricity generation. This sector is absorbing skilled workers and stimulating related industries.\n   - **Energy Demand**: The expansion of data centers is influencing energy and infrastructure sectors, leading to increased orders for energy-related services.\n\n3. **General Trends**:\n   - Across various districts, there is a trend of softening demand for refined products and labor in certain sectors, reflecting broader economic headwinds.\n   - The energy industry is diversifying, with segments like solar development and carbon capture gaining attention, although solar projects have recently slowed.\n\nIn summary, while the Gulf of Mexico's crude oil production and LNG exports are performing strongly, other areas like refined products are facing challenges, and the energy sector is adapting to new demands from emerging industries like data centers.",

      "expected": "In Kansas City, while expectations for 2026 were optimistic, consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately, signaling stress among households. In Chicago, business loan demand decreased slightly on net with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity, while consumer loan demand increased slightly with a pickup in mortgage refinancing. In Dallas, loan demand grew overall. St. Louis reported banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions. Consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.",
      "graphrag_answer": "Banking conditions for consumer versus business lending across districts show notable differences. \n\nIn the New York District, consumer lending is characterized by steady demand, particularly for consumer loans and residential mortgages, despite a deterioration in the quality of the consumer loan portfolio. This suggests that while more individuals are borrowing, their ability to repay is declining, raising concerns about future credit quality (e.g., \"Consumer loan portfolio quality is deteriorating despite ongoing demand\"). \n\nConversely, business lending is facing challenges, with a decline in demand for business loans and worsening delinquency rates. This indicates that businesses are either less willing or able to take on new debt, reflecting broader economic uncertainty (e.g., \"Demand for business loans has been declining, and delinquency rates for these loans have worsened slightly\"). The combination of reduced demand and rising delinquencies suggests emerging financial stress among business borrowers.\n\nIn the Memphis focus, while there is moderate loan demand overall, banks are tightening lending standards, particularly affecting smaller investors, which may limit access to credit for businesses (e.g., \"Limited Access to Credit for Smaller Investors\"). However, commercial loan demand remains strong, indicating some resilience in that sector despite stricter lending criteria.\n\nOverall, consumer lending shows steady demand but deteriorating quality, while business lending is marked by declining demand and rising delinquencies, highlighting a more cautious environment for businesses compared to consumers.",

      "expected": "In Dallas, price pressures were subdued in services but remained elevated in the manufacturing sector. In Richmond, price growth remained moderate overall despite some pickup in price growth in the manufacturing sector. In Chicago, producer prices grew moderately with contacts reporting moderate nonlabor cost increases including energy and raw materials. Manufacturing contacts attributed some raw materials price increases to tariffs, suggesting tariffs disproportionately affected goods-producing sectors.",
      "graphrag_answer": "Price pressures in the manufacturing and services sectors exhibited notable differences. \n\nIn the manufacturing sector, there were strong pressures from rising input and raw material costs, which significantly influenced overall price increases. Manufacturing firms reported that input prices grew at a strong pace, with raw material costs previously described as being at a 'boil' but now shifting to a 'simmer,' indicating some moderation yet still elevated costs (Data: Entities (993, 1051)). The overall price increases in manufacturing were characterized as modest to moderate, driven by these input cost pressures (Data: Entities (42, 950)).\n\nConversely, in the services sector, particularly within professional and business services, wage growth remained modest to moderate, with easing wage pressures contributing to this moderation (Data: Entities (195, 386)). While there were still localized wage increases due to labor market competition, the overall intensity of wage pressures was diminishing, leading to a more stable wage environment (Data: Relationships (613)). Additionally, the nonfinancial services sector faced rising costs, particularly in health care, which contributed to increased input costs but did not exhibit the same level of price pressure as manufacturing (Data: Entities (46, 331)).\n\nIn summary, manufacturing faced stronger and more direct input cost pressures leading to price increases, while the services sector experienced more moderate wage growth and easing pressures, resulting in less pronounced price pressures overall.",

      "expected": "Employers showed cautious hiring behavior: More employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. Those still hiring favored temporary and part-time workers over full-time employment. In Boston, both hiring and layoffs increased modestly, indicating churn rather than net growth. Employment in IT services increased modestly with hiring in sales and technical positions - a relative bright spot. Jobseekers in Cleveland reported offers were more likely to be part-time with little or no benefits. This pattern indicates employer uncertainty and reluctance to commit to permanent workforce expansion.",
      "graphrag_answer": "Hiring patterns have shifted towards cautiousness, with employers increasingly selective and focused on maintaining stable head counts rather than expanding their workforce. This is evidenced by reports of stabilizing or declining head counts, where most employers are hiring only to replace departing workers rather than adding new positions. The trend of increased use of temporary and part-time work arrangements further indicates a preference for flexibility in staffing, allowing firms to manage costs amid economic uncertainty.\n\nThese cautious hiring practices reflect a broader lack of employer confidence, as firms are responding to mixed labor demand and uncertainties in consumer demand and labor supply. The overall waning of labor demand, coupled with selective hiring and a focus on cost containment, suggests that employers are hesitant to commit to long-term staffing increases. This is further supported by the rise in temporary employment and the reduction of staffing hours in response to softer sales, indicating a labor market under pressure and a reluctance to expand in the face of economic challenges. \n\nIn summary, the changes in hiring patterns\u2014characterized by selective hiring, increased temporary arrangements, and a focus on cost management\u2014indicate a significant level of caution and reduced confidence among employers regarding future economic conditions.",
