Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months.

Overall consumer spending, particularly on retail goods, inched down in recent weeks, although auto sales were boosted in some Districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September. Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty.

Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity.

They are not explicitly contradicted by the ground truth, but they are beyond what’s asked and not needed.\n\nThus, one key element is captured (temp/part-time over full-time), while another key element (improved labor availability) is absent.

Within sectors, construction, leisure and hospitality, wholesale, and education saw strong wage growth, while wage growth slowed to a slight pace in finance. Firms expected wage growth to accelerate in coming months.\n\n- **Minneapolis (Ninth District)**: Wage growth was characterized as modest to moderate; other summary language described it as moderate.\n\n- **St. Louis (Eighth District)**: Wage growth was moderate. Some specific examples included compensation growth expected at about 3.0–3.5% for an apparel retailer and a 4% cost-of-living adjustment at a regional airport.\n\n- **San Francisco (Twelfth District)**: Wages grew slightly, similar to previous periods. Wage pressures softened across many sectors but remained elevated for highly specialized AI roles and some lower-wage construction and manufacturing jobs; health care wages rose due to recent union contracts.\n\n- **Atlanta (Sixth District)**: Wages rose modestly, generally in the 1–3% range, and wage pressures continued to ease.\n\n- **Richmond (Fifth District)**: Wage growth remained moderate, with that description repeated in both the labor-market and overall economic summaries.\n\n- **Philadelphia (Third District)**: Wage inflation continued to ease, but firms still reported modest wage increases, roughly in line with long‑run averages.\n\n- **Cleveland (Fourth District)**: Wage pressures were modest overall. Many firms implemented routine annual increases, some raised wages due to competition (especially in banking and professional/business services), while others—such as some manufacturers and a restaurant—held wages flat or tried to contain them.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the expected answer: (1) Wages grew across all reporting Districts; (2) The pace was generally modest to moderate. \n\nThe system answer states upfront: \"Wages grew in all reporting Federal Reserve Districts at generally modest to moderate rates\" and reiterates this in the national summary: \"Wages grew across every District at a modest to moderate pace…\" This matches both core elements of the ground truth. \n\nThe rest of the answer adds district‑level detail, but nothing contradicts the expected answer. Where it gives specific characterizations (modest, moderate, slight, etc.), they are consistent with a generally modest‑to‑moderate pace overall. There are no factual contradictions with the ground truth statement, just additional specificity. \n\nTherefore the system answer fully captures the expected answer and adds consistent detail, so it is correct.",

The key ideas: (1) mixed conditions across these real estate sectors, (2) some improvement tied to lower interest rates, (3) other reports still showing muted activity.\n\nSystem answer: gives a long, detailed summary describing residential as generally weak/flat and commercial as mostly flat to slightly improving but uneven across sectors, then lists many district examples. It correctly conveys that conditions were mixed/uneven and that commercial in some places was improving while others were weak or flat, which aligns with the \"mixed\" aspect and muted activity in places. However, it never mentions anything about improved business lending due to lower interest rates or links to lower interest rates at all, which is a core element of the expected answer. It is not contradicting that, but it omits this key point.\n\nSo: it captures the mixed/uneven conditions and muted/flat activity aspects but misses the interest-rate / improved lending element. The content it gives is consistent, not incorrect, but incomplete relative to the expected answer.\n\nTherefore the answer is partially correct, not fully correct and not incorrect.",

Retailers and restaurants across Cape Cod, coastal New Hampshire, and Maine reported that summer spending totals rose moderately from the previous year owing to an increase in the number of day trips. The number of Canadian travelers to New England remained down sharply from the previous year, and certain parts of Cape Cod and Maine experienced weaker summer tourism activity (from the previous year) as a result. Nonetheless, tourism-related spending increased modestly overall, as domestic and other international travel compensated for the decline in Canadian visitors. Auto sales in New Hampshire increased modestly from last month, driven by the rush to purchase electric vehicles before the expiration of tax credits.

It also reframes the overall picture as broadly weak instead of mixed, conflicting with the expected answer.\n\nBecause it misses several key required facts, contradicts the “mixed” characterization, and provides an overall impression that is at odds with the expected answer, the response is not just incomplete but substantively incorrect relative to the ground truth.\n\nVerdict: incorrect.",

Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts.

Nevertheless, labor supply in the hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing sectors was reportedly strained in several Districts due to recent changes to immigration policies.

(4) Chicago - manufacturing contacts attributed metals price increases to tariffs, while contacts noted fear of immigration enforcement was reducing labor availability and revoked visas created rehiring needs. (5) St. Louis - contacts reported managing tariffs as a cost factor, while immigration policies resulted in labor shortages with workers in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture not reporting to work due to fears of deportation. (6) San Francisco - higher import duties led to cost increases for raw materials and electronic components used in manufacturing, while contacts in construction and manufacturing noted difficulty finding entry-level workers attributed to reduced immigration.",

      "judge_reasoning": "The expected answer states that steel prices decreased in the Atlanta (Sixth) District and lumber prices decreased in the San Francisco (Twelfth) District, both due to waning demand, and notes that this occurred even as overall prices rose. The system answer correctly identifies the same two materials (steel and lumber), the same districts (Sixth/Atlanta and Twelfth/San Francisco), and correctly attributes the price decreases to waning/weakened demand. It does not contradict anything and fully matches the key facts; it only omits the contextual note that overall prices rose, which is not essential to the direct question.

This matches point (1) and even elaborates.\n- It describes middle- and lower-income households as more cautious, more price sensitive, focusing on value, deals, sales, markdowns, and discounts, which aligns with point (2).\n- It attributes these differences to thinner financial buffers, elevated prices and tariffs making lower/middle-income consumers more price sensitive, and increased reliance on credit and assistance programs, which corresponds to rising prices eroding purchasing power for these groups (point 3).\n- It notes higher-income households had more savings and capacity to absorb higher prices and tariffs, so their spending remained resilient—this matches the idea that they were insulated (point 4).\n- There are no contradictions with the expected answer; the system answer is more detailed but consistent.\n\nTherefore, the system answer contains all key facts from the expected answer, with additional correct detail and no evident errors or contradictions.",

This matches key fact 1.\n- It describes AI investment as contributing to flat or declining employment in certain areas and occupations and a dampening effect on labor demand, which is consistent in spirit with muted labor demand and more layoffs/attrition.\n- However, the system answer does not mention that overall employment levels were largely stable, nor does it explicitly characterize labor demand as generally muted at the aggregate level; instead it emphasizes reduced or slower-growing employment and, in places, \"larger layoffs\" and \"flat or declining employment\" that may overstate the broad Beige Book message relative to the ground truth summary.\n- It also introduces several district-specific claims (Atlanta, Kansas City, Minneapolis) and details that are not in the expected answer. Those additions may or may not be accurate to the source Beige Book, but they are beyond what is required and shift the emphasis away from the summarized relationship.\n\nGiven the rubric, the core relationship (AI investment linked to headcount reduction via layoffs/attrition and dampening labor demand) is captured, but important aspects of the expected answer (overall employment largely stable; labor demand generally muted rather than broadly declining) are missing, and the framing slightly overemphasizes declines. There are no direct contradictions of the expected answer, but it is incomplete relative to the key points.\n\nTherefore the answer is accurate on the overlapping content but not fully aligned with all key elements, so it is partially correct rather than fully correct.",

That aligns well with the expected answer’s key Minneapolis fact.\n- Does not mention the St. Louis District at all, so it omits the expected detail about strained and worsening conditions and pessimistic outlook there.\n- It gives a broader, district-by-district discussion (Chicago, Atlanta, Minneapolis, San Francisco) about how trade tensions, especially with China, weakened export demand and depressed crop prices, and concludes that trade tensions reduced export demand, depressed prices, heightened uncertainty, and damped investment. This is broadly consistent with the expected high-level statement that agricultural activity was generally down and trade uncertainty added to challenges, though it goes into more detail and includes additional districts.\n- There are no clear factual contradictions with the expected answer, but one key expected element (St. Louis) is missing.\n\nBecause the core Minneapolis trade-related concern is present and the general effect of trade uncertainty on agriculture is correctly summarized, but the specific St. Louis information is absent, the answer is incomplete rather than wrong or misleading.\n",

In the Cleveland District, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to uncertainty around federal grants. In the Boston District, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health-care sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Federal policy changes—specifically reductions and uncertainty in federal benefit and grant programs—negatively affected nonprofits across multiple districts by:\n\n- Increasing demand for services: Cuts or planned cuts to programs like SNAP and Medicaid (Boston [8]) and reductions in federal benefit programs (New York [1]) increased financial distress among low- and moderate-income households, driving more people to seek food, housing, utility, and health-care assistance from nonprofits (New York [1], Dallas [3], San Francisco [4]).\n\n- Straining nonprofit finances: Reduced or uncertain federal funding and grants led to decreased organizational funding and forced some nonprofits to draw down reserves, delay or avoid hiring, and plan for smaller budgets (Cleveland [2], Chicago [5], St. Louis [6]).\n\n- Forcing operational adjustments: Because of these funding pressures, nonprofits in several districts looked for new or alternative revenue streams—such as fees for online content or e-commerce sales—to compensate for lost or uncertain federal support (Dallas [3], Chicago [5]).",

These are not necessarily wrong but go beyond what is asked, and they do not contradict the ground truth.\n\nThus, while some key elements (New York financial distress tied to federal benefit changes; Cleveland hiring freezes due to grant uncertainty) are captured, the specific Boston point about layoffs in education and health care due to federal grant cuts is missing. The answer is incomplete but not factually inconsistent with the expected answer.",

This matches the expected sectors.\n- St. Louis District: The system states that the St. Louis District has manufacturing, construction, and agriculture labor shortages, \"with districtwide summary noting immigration-policy-related labor shortages\" — this is consistent in spirit with the expected answer that St. Louis explicitly stated contacts continue to report immigration-policy-related labor shortages.\n- Boston District: The expected answer specifically highlights the Boston District’s retail and tourism contacts and mentions Maine and Vermont. The system answer does not mention Boston at all, nor retail, tourism, Maine, or Vermont.\n- The system adds several other districts (Atlanta, New York, San Francisco, National Summary) that are not referenced in the expected answer. These additions are not stated to be false in the ground truth, but they go beyond what was asked. There is no explicit contradiction with the expected answer, just additional detail.\n\nThus, the system answer includes all sectors correctly and one of the key district points (St. Louis), but omits the other key district (Boston and its details). No clear factual contradiction with the expected answer is evident based solely on the prompt. This makes the answer incomplete but not misleading.\n\nTherefore the appropriate verdict is PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

      "system_answer": "Multiple factors affected labor costs:\n\n1. **Wage and salary increases**\n   - Wages grew in all reporting Districts, generally at a **modest to moderate** pace.\n   - Some sectors and locations saw stronger increases (e.g., **hospitality and tourism** firms with 3%+ wage hikes; strong wage growth in **construction, leisure and hospitality, wholesale, and education**; a **4% cost-of-living adjustment** at a regional airport).\n   - Wage pressures were **easing** in many places (e.g., Atlanta, Minneapolis, Philadelphia), with some firms holding wages steady because of **weak profitability** or muted demand.\n\n2. **Benefits and nonwage labor costs**\n   - **Employer-sponsored health insurance** costs increased notably and were a key driver of higher labor costs nationwide: “labor cost pressures intensified in recent weeks due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses.”\n   - Specific examples include a regional airport making a “**significant increase in employer contributions to the health insurance program**” and many contacts citing higher **health insurance premiums**.\n   - Other cost categories (e.g., **liability insurance** in Boston) also rose, adding to overall employment-related expenses though not always labeled explicitly as labor costs.\n\n3. **Labor availability and policy-related constraints**\n   - In several sectors—**hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing**—labor supply was strained due to **changes in immigration policies**, which can force firms to raise wages or offer better terms to attract scarce workers.\n   - Some employers, facing weak demand and better labor availability overall, favored **temporary and part-time workers** over full-time hires, which can alter the composition of labor costs even if hourly wages rise modestly.\n\n**How these factors interacted with wage growth:**\n\n- Even where **wage growth itself was only modest**, **total labor costs rose more than wages alone** because of:\n  - **Sharp increases in health insurance and other benefit costs**, which intensified labor cost pressures despite easing wage inflation.\n  - **Sector-specific labor shortages** (often tied to immigration changes) that kept wage pressures elevated in certain industries (e.g., hospitality, construction, some manufacturing) even as broader wage growth was slowing.\n- Conversely, in sectors facing **soft demand or profitability issues**, firms tried to restrain wage growth (holding wages flat, hiring near minimum wage, shifting to part-time/temporary workers) to offset rising nonwage labor costs.\n\nIn sum, labor costs were driven by the combination of modest-to-moderate wage increases, sharply rising benefit costs—especially health insurance—and labor-supply constraints in specific sectors, with firms’ wage-setting decisions shaped by both these cost pressures and underlying demand/profitability conditions.",

This matches point (1).\n- It explicitly notes that employer-sponsored health insurance costs increased notably and directly quotes that “labor cost pressures intensified … due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses.” This matches point (2).\n- It discusses other nonwage costs, including liability insurance, but it does not specifically mention the Chicago District’s increases in energy and raw materials. However, that detail is not essential to the core causal chain; mentioning other cost categories is not contradictory.\n- It clearly states that total labor costs rose more than wages alone because of sharp increases in health insurance and other benefit costs, which matches point (4).\n- There are no factual contradictions with the expected answer. The additional details about sectors, immigration, part-time work, and profitability are expansions that do not conflict with the ground truth.\n\nAll key points from the expected answer (modest/moderate wage growth, intensified labor cost pressures from health insurance, and total compensation rising faster than wages) are present and accurately described. The omission of the specific Chicago energy/raw materials example is minor and does not make the answer incomplete in terms of the question asked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is fully consistent and complete relative to the expected answer.",

      "question": "How did lower interest rates affect different interest rate-sensitive sectors across districts?",
      "expected_answer": "Lower interest rates had positive effects across multiple sectors: In Cleveland, commercial construction and financial services saw uptick in demand due to lower rates. In Chicago, financial conditions loosened modestly with business loan volumes increasing. However, the impact was mixed - while some reports noted improved business lending, residential real estate remained weak in Dallas and home sales were flat in Boston. The housing market's response to lower rates was more muted than commercial sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Lower interest rates had mixed effects across interest rate‑sensitive sectors and districts:\n\n- **Bank lending (general financial services):**\n  - **Cleveland (4th District)**: Bankers reported **moderate increases in loan demand** from both households and businesses, explicitly attributing this to **lower interest rates**. They also **expected a sharp further increase in loan demand** with anticipated additional rate cuts. Commercial construction and financial services contacts likewise saw **an uptick in demand because of lower rates**.\n  - **San Francisco (12th District)**: Recent **rate reductions began to spur additional loan demand**, though borrowers remained cautious, and overall lending activity was described as largely steady.\n  - **Chicago (7th District)**: Business loan rates moved down, and **consumer loan demand increased slightly**, with some pickup in **mortgage refinancing**, indicating some rate‑sensitive response on the household side even as business loan demand decreased slightly.\n  - **National summary**: Across “other interest rate‑sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate,” and financial services, conditions were **mixed**; some districts reported **improved business lending due to lower interest rates**, while others still reported **muted activity**.\n\n- **Commercial construction / commercial real estate:**\n  - **Cleveland**: **Commercial construction** contacts specifically tied their **uptick in demand** to **lower interest rates**.\n  - **National summary**: Commercial real estate was grouped with other rate‑sensitive sectors as **mixed**—some improvement linked to lower rates, but in other districts activity remained subdued.\n  - Other district reports (Atlanta, Minneapolis, San Francisco) described commercial real estate as flat or unchanged and did not link it clearly to lower rates, underscoring the “mixed” national characterization.\n\n- **Residential real estate / mortgages:**\n  - **New York (2nd District)**: Banks reported **moderate growth in demand for residential mortgages, with strong lending volumes**, consistent with a favorable rate environment even though overall loan demand declined.\n  - **Chicago**: Noted a **pickup in mortgage refinancing** as rates moved down.\n  - Other districts (Atlanta, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Dallas) generally reported **weak or declining residential real estate activity**, without tying this weakness directly to interest rate moves, again consistent with the national note that the response of this rate‑sensitive sector was **mixed**.\n\nIn sum, lower interest rates clearly **boosted loan demand in some districts and sectors** (notably Cleveland’s commercial construction and financial services, mortgage demand in New York, refinancing and some consumer lending in Chicago, and some loan demand in San Francisco), but **other interest rate‑sensitive sectors—especially parts of residential and commercial real estate and business lending in some districts—remained muted**, leading to an overall picture of **uneven, district‑ and sector‑specific benefits**.",

      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the expected answer:\n1) Lower rates had positive effects across multiple sectors, especially in Cleveland where commercial construction and financial services saw upticks in demand due to lower rates.\n2) In Chicago, financial conditions loosened modestly with business loan volumes increasing.\n3) The impact was mixed: some improved business lending contrasted with weak residential real estate in Dallas and flat home sales in Boston.\n4) Housing’s response to lower rates was more muted than commercial sectors.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer correctly describes Cleveland: it explicitly notes commercial construction and financial services contacts saw an uptick in demand because of lower rates. This matches the ground truth.\n- The system answer describes Chicago differently from the ground truth. It says consumer loan demand increased slightly and business loan demand decreased slightly, whereas the expected answer states business loan volumes increased. This is a direct contradiction on a key point.\n- On residential real estate, the system answer captures that effects were mixed and notes weak/declining residential real estate in several districts and a generally muted response relative to other sectors. This aligns conceptually with “housing market's response … was more muted than commercial sectors,” although it does not specifically mention Boston flat sales or Dallas weakness being linked to lower rates. However, it does mention Dallas weak residential activity in aggregate.\n- The system answer adds districts (New York, San Francisco, etc.), which is acceptable if accurate, but the Chicago business lending detail is factually inconsistent with the expected answer.\n\nBecause there is a clear contradiction on a central fact (direction of business loan volumes in Chicago) the answer cannot be considered fully or even just partially correct under the rubric; it contains factual error relative to the expected answer.\n",

Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity.

      "system_answer": "Several distinct factors contributed to economic uncertainty across districts, including:\n\n1. **Tariffs and Trade Policy**\n   - Higher tariffs and “trade-policy uncertainty” reduced manufacturing demand (National Summary [1], Cleveland [3], Philadelphia [6], Richmond [12]).\n   - Concerns about tariff-linked price increases for consumers, especially low- and moderate-income households (Boston Community Perspectives [2], Boston [8]).\n\n2. **Government Policy Risks and Possible Shutdown**\n   - Explicit concern about “downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown” (National Summary [1], Philadelphia [6]).\n   - Domestic policy uncertainty more broadly cited as a primary concern (Dallas [7]).\n\n3. **Weakening or Shifting Demand**\n   - Waning overall demand in manufacturing and softness in agriculture, energy, transportation (National Summary [1]).\n   - Declines or flat activity in key sectors (retail, services, housing, agriculture) in multiple districts (San Francisco [4], Kansas City [5], Dallas [7], Minneapolis [9], New York [11]).\n   - Customer uncertainty and price sensitivity affecting manufacturing orders (Richmond [12]).\n\n4. **Household Financial Strain and Cost of Living**\n   - Rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty leading lower- and middle-income households to seek discounts and promotions (National Summary [1]).\n   - Greater use of food pantries, difficulty paying rent and utilities, and reliance on savings to cover basic needs (Boston Community Perspectives [2]).\n   - Anticipated cuts to SNAP and Medicaid raising concern for vulnerable households (Boston Community Perspectives [2]).\n\n5. **Input Cost Pressures**\n   - Robust nonlabor cost growth and higher input prices (Cleveland [3], National Summary [10], Chicago Agriculture [14]).\n   - Outsized increases in employer health insurance costs adding to labor cost pressures (National Summary – Labor Markets [13]).\n   - Rising fertilizer and other farm input costs creating uncertainty about 2026 margins (Chicago Agriculture [14]).\n\n6. **Agricultural and Trade Developments**\n   - Lower soybean prices and concern over China’s reduction or elimination of soybean purchases (Minneapolis [9], Chicago Agriculture [14]).\n   - Unclear economic outlook dampening capital investment in agriculture (Chicago Agriculture [14]).\n\n7. **Labor Market and Technology-Related Uncertainty**\n   - Layoffs and attrition linked to weaker demand, “elevated economic uncertainty,” and increased investment in AI technologies (National Summary – Labor Markets [13]).\n   - Strained labor supply in some sectors due to immigration policy changes (National Summary – Labor Markets [13]).\n\n8. **Sector- and Region-Specific Structural Issues**\n   - Workforce housing shortages and rising construction costs in New England (Boston Community Perspectives [2]).\n   - Deterioration in consumer loan portfolios (Kansas City [5]) and weakening demand as a key concern for outlooks (Dallas [7]).\n\nAcross districts, the combination of policy uncertainty (tariffs, government shutdown risk, domestic and immigration policy), cost pressures, weakening or uneven demand, and financial stress on lower-income households were the main contributors to elevated economic uncertainty.",

      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements in the expected answer:\n1) Tariff policy changes made planning difficult for manufacturers (Chicago and across districts).\n2) Federal grant uncertainty affected nonprofits (Cleveland, New York, Boston).\n3) Policy uncertainty was a top business concern (Dallas).\n4) Immigration policy changes created labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston).\n5) Potential for government shutdown was a downside risk.\n6) Kansas City noted that despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic.\n\nCheck against system answer:\n1) Tariffs/trade policy: System discusses tariffs and “trade-policy uncertainty” reducing manufacturing demand and causing price concerns. This matches the tariff-related uncertainty, even if it doesn’t explicitly say “planning difficult for manufacturers in Chicago,” but it captures the core factor (tariff/trade policy uncertainty) and even cites Chicago Agriculture in another bullet.\n2) Federal grant uncertainty for nonprofits: Not mentioned at all in the system answer. This is a missing key factor.\n3) Policy uncertainty as a top concern (Dallas): System explicitly mentions “Domestic policy uncertainty more broadly cited as a primary concern (Dallas [7]).” This matches.\n4) Immigration policy changes and labor supply (St. Louis, Boston): System mentions “Strained labor supply in some sectors due to immigration policy changes (National Summary – Labor Markets [13]).” This captures the factor (immigration policy–driven labor supply concerns), though it doesn’t name St. Louis or Boston, but the substance is there.\n5) Government shutdown risk: System explicitly notes “downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.” This matches.\n6) Kansas City, decline now but optimistic about 2026: System mentions Kansas City only in context of “deterioration in consumer loan portfolios (Kansas City [5])” and uncertainty about 2026 margins in Chicago agriculture, but it does not capture the KC detail that despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic. That specific aspect is missing/incorrectly replaced by a different 2026 reference.\n\nAdditionally, the system introduces many other factors (household financial strain, input cost pressures, sector-specific issues) that are not in the expected answer. These are not directly contradictory but go beyond what was asked. The main issues are omissions: no mention of federal grant uncertainty affecting nonprofits, and no mention of the optimistic 2026 expectations in Kansas City. There are no clear factual contradictions to the ground truth; the extra details may or may not be supported by the underlying context, but in relation to the expected answer they are just additions, not contradictions.\n\nBecause several expected key factors are missing, but the ones present are accurately represented, the answer is incomplete rather than wrong or abstaining.",

In New York, rising business costs including insurance added to financial pressures for community service providers. Employer-sponsored health insurance expenses saw outsized increases, intensifying labor cost pressures across districts. These service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.",

This covers the requirement to explain how different sectors were affected, even going into more detail than the expected answer.\n- There are no evident contradictions or factual errors given the expected answer; the system answer is more detailed but stays within the same conceptual boundaries (service costs up, sectoral cost/margin pressures, limited pass-through, etc.).\n\nBecause all key elements from the expected answer are captured (types of service costs, their role in input cost increases, interaction with tariffs, and differential sectoral effects), and no incorrect information is introduced, the answer is fully correct and even more detailed than required.",

      "expected_answer": "In Chicago, leisure and hospitality sales were mixed. Categories seeing gains included restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments, as well as new light vehicle sales which were brisk due to strong underlying demand and the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases. Categories seeing softness included travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels. Used vehicle sales remained steady though dealerships in low-to-moderate income communities reported softer demand. This pattern reflects consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.",
      "system_answer": "Across the reports, categories with **gains** versus **declines** and the implied behavior patterns are:\n\n**Retail categories with gains:**\n- **Back-to-school and selected goods:** Appliances, computers, and landscaping products (Chicago [1]); apparel, cosmetics, and fragrances (New York [9]); some higher-end retailers (Richmond [3]).  \n- **Luxury and higher-end spending:** Luxury goods and athletic footwear (San Francisco [2]); luxury restaurants and some higher-end retail (Richmond [3]); luxury accommodations and services (Boston tourism [15], St. Louis travel for upper-income and corporate clients [11]).  \n- **Quick service / value-focused food away from home:** Fast food, fast casual, and family dining (Chicago [1]); quick service restaurants and some entertainment venues (San Francisco services [12]); modest restaurant growth overall in Richmond [14].  \n- **Electric vehicles (near tax-credit deadlines):** New EV sales and light vehicles surged where buyers rushed to beat expiring tax credits (Chicago [1], Atlanta [6], Boston [15]); some auto sales edged up as conditions normalized (New York [9]).  \n- **Health-related services and products:** Health-related food services and business technology demand grew (San Francisco services [12]); health care retailers saw flat to slight increases (Dallas [5]).  \n- **Selective tourism and day trips:** Luxury and premium tourism segments (Boston [15], some Richmond hotels [3]); increased day-trip spending in New England (Boston [15]).\n\n**Retail categories with declines:**\n- **General consumer goods and basics in some regions:** Food products, beverages, clothing, pet supplies (San Francisco retail [2]); many non-auto retail sales slightly down (Philadelphia [4], Atlanta [6], Cleveland [10], Dallas [5], Minneapolis [7], Kansas City [8]).  \n- **Electronics and home-related goods:** Other consumer electronics and building materials (Chicago [1]); building materials, garden equipment, furniture, electronic and appliance stores (Dallas [5]); furniture and some home-construction-related retail (Richmond [3]).  \n- **Lower-priced / budget goods:** Demand for more affordable goods weakened while luxury held up (San Francisco [2]); value-oriented consumers pulling back and stretching dollars (Cleveland [10], Minneapolis [7], Kansas City [8]).  \n- **Full-service and casual dining:** Casual sit-down restaurants softened (Richmond [3]); full-service restaurant sales declined, with some closures (San Francisco services [12]); diners skipping desserts and alcoholic beverages (Atlanta [6]).  \n- **Travel, hospitality, and tourism (select segments):** Softer airline and hotel demand in some areas (Chicago [1]); lower travel-related retail and tourism spending in several districts (San Francisco [2], Minneapolis [7], Cleveland [10], St. Louis [11]); business travel and conference-related hotel stays weaker (Richmond [3], Washington, D.C. area hotels).  \n- **Autos in several regions:** Weak or flat auto sales in Dallas [5], Cleveland [10], Kansas City [8], with a shift toward family sedans and used vehicles (Kansas City [8]) and softer demand in low- to moderate-income areas (Chicago [1]).  \n\n**How this reflects consumer behavior patterns:**\n- **Income and segment divergence:** Higher- and upper-income consumers continue to spend on luxury goods, premium dining, and upscale travel, while middle- and lower-income consumers are cutting back, visible in rising use of credit, food pantries, “buy now, pay later,” and cautious middle-class travel (St. Louis [11], Boston [13], multiple districts).  \n- **Heightened price sensitivity and value-seeking:** Many consumers are “looking for value,” bargain-hunting, and responding strongly to discounts and promotions (Richmond [3,14]; Kansas City [8]; Minneapolis [7]; Cleveland [10]). They are trading down (e.g., skipping extras at restaurants, choosing used or cheaper vehicles, renovating instead of moving).  \n- **Shift within categories rather than uniform drops:** Within autos, demand shifts from EVs and SUVs to family sedans and used vehicles once incentives fade (Kansas City [8]); within food service, quick-service and value-oriented formats gain while full-service and mid-priced casual dining lose.  \n- **Tariff and cost-driven pullbacks:** Higher prices linked to tariffs contribute to weaker demand for many goods, especially lower-priced and discretionary items (San Francisco [2], Dallas [5], Cleveland [10], Atlanta [6]).  \n- **Experience and convenience still matter—but selectively:** Spending holds up in some entertainment and quick-service venues and in convenience-oriented segments, particularly when supported by marketing or promotions (San Francisco services [12]), while more expensive, discretionary travel and elective services see cutbacks.\n\nOverall, gains concentrate in **luxury, value-focused quick-service, certain tech/appliance categories, and time-limited auto purchases**, while **broad-based, price-sensitive, and mid-market categories (basic goods, furniture, building materials, casual dining, and many travel segments)** see declines. This points to a bifurcated consumer base: resilient higher-income spending alongside increasingly cautious, price-sensitive behavior among middle- and lower-income households.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key points from the expected answer:\n- Location focus: Chicago.\n- Gains: (1) Restaurants in fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments; (2) New light vehicle sales brisk due to strong underlying demand and end of EV tax incentives.\n- Softness/declines: (1) Travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels; (2) Used vehicle sales steady overall but softer demand in low-to-moderate income communities.\n- Interpretation: Consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.\n\nAssessment of system answer:\n- It does mention: fast food, fast casual, and family dining gains in Chicago, and notes \"new EV sales and light vehicles surged where buyers rushed to beat expiring tax credits (Chicago [1]...)\" which matches the idea of brisk new light vehicle sales tied to expiring tax incentives. It also notes \"softer airline and hotel demand in some areas (Chicago [1])\" and \"softer demand in low- to moderate-income areas (Chicago [1])\" for autos. These overlap with the ground truth.\n- However, the system answer is not confined to Chicago; it brings in many other districts and a large number of additional categories (luxury goods, back-to-school, building materials, tariffs, etc.) that are not in the expected answer. The task is to answer specifically which retail categories saw gains versus declines and how this reflects consumer behavior patterns in the Chicago context.\n- Some of this additional material is speculative or generalized beyond the Chicago context, e.g., elaborate discussion of luxury vs. budget divergence, tariffs, and detailed cross-district patterns. While not necessarily factually false, it is not supported by the given expected answer and could be considered outside scope. But importantly, the core Chicago facts are not contradicted.\n- The behavior interpretation in the system answer includes: income and segment divergence, heightened price sensitivity, value-seeking, shifts within categories, etc. The piece that aligns with the expected answer is \"within food service, quick-service and value-oriented formats gain while full-service ... lose\" and price-sensitive, value-seeking consumers. The explicit summary \"This points to a bifurcated consumer base: resilient higher-income spending alongside increasingly cautious, price-sensitive behavior among middle- and lower-income households\" only partially overlaps with the expected simpler explanation \"consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.\" It goes far beyond, but does include the idea of value-seeking and some cutbacks in travel-related spending.\n- There are no clear factual contradictions to the expected Chicago facts; rather the answer is overbroad and adds a lot of extra but not obviously false information.\n\nGiven this, the system answer contains the key Chicago facts (gains in fast food/fast casual/family dining; brisk new light vehicle sales due to tax incentives; softness in airlines/hotels; softer used-vehicle demand in low/mod income communities) and captures the behavioral pattern (value-seeking in dining, cutting back on travel), though embedded in a much larger, less focused discussion. That fits “PARTIALLY_CORRECT” vs “CORRECT”? The definition of CORRECT requires all key facts present and no factual errors. All key facts are present, and there are no clear contradictions; extra details aren't penalized by the rubric. So despite being verbose and out of scope, it still satisfies the criteria for CORRECT.\n",

      "expected_answer": "In Kansas City, while expectations for 2026 were optimistic, consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately, signaling stress among households. In Chicago, business loan demand decreased slightly on net with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity, while consumer loan demand increased slightly with a pickup in mortgage refinancing. In Dallas, loan demand grew overall. St. Louis reported banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions. Consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.",
      "system_answer": "Across districts, business lending generally showed weaker demand but better loan performance than consumer lending, while consumer lending often faced rising delinquencies and more concern about future credit quality.\n\nBy district from the context:\n\n- **Kansas City**: Overall loan demand and credit standards were steady, but banks reported **moderate deterioration specifically in consumer lending portfolios** and expected further challenges for consumer loans; no comparable deterioration was highlighted for business loans.\n\n- **St. Louis**: Commercial loan demand was described as **strong** (with a “bullish mindset” in one area), though small business demand was depressed but rebuilding. In contrast, **consumer delinquency rates were steadily increasing**, and banks were tightening standards broadly (including more scrutiny of small business loans).\n\n- **New York**: **Demand for business loans sagged**, driving an overall decline in loan demand, while **demand for consumer loans (and residential mortgages) held steady or grew moderately**. Delinquency rates worsened **especially for business loans**, and credit standards tightened overall.\n\n- **Philadelphia**: **Business lending (commercial & industrial and commercial real estate) declined**, while **most consumer lending categories (other consumer loans, home equity lines, auto, mortgages) rose**, though credit card volumes fell.\n\n- **Chicago**: **Business loan demand decreased slightly** and business loan quality declined modestly. For consumers, **loan demand increased slightly and loan quality was flat**, with both business and consumer terms tightening.\n\n- **Atlanta**: Loan demand from both corporate borrowers and consumers was **muted**, and **overall consumer lending contracted further**. Delinquencies ticked up, but this was discussed at an aggregate level rather than clearly separating consumer from business quality.\n\n- **Dallas**: Credit standards tightened for **most loan types** but **eased slightly for residential real estate**. Over the next three months, banks expect to tighten standards for **all loan types except residential real estate**. Commercial real estate loan performance **improved sharply**, while overall loan performance **deteriorated slightly**.\n\n- **San Francisco** (banking/finance detail): **Demand for commercial loans was muted**, except where boosted by specific projects; lending activity was otherwise steady and credit quality generally stable, without a marked difference stated between consumer and business loan performance.\n\n- **Richmond**: Demand for most loan types was stable, with some modest increase in commercial loan demand. **Delinquencies rose mainly in consumer loan portfolios** (including mortgages and home equity), suggesting consumer conditions were weaker than business conditions.\n\n- **Cleveland**: Loan demand from **both households and businesses increased moderately**, with overall delinquency rates flat; the report did not highlight a clear divergence between consumer and business loan performance.\n\nOverall pattern from the excerpts:  \n- **Demand:** Business loan demand was often flat to declining (New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco, Atlanta), while consumer lending demand was mixed—rising in some districts (Philadelphia, Chicago), contracting or muted in others (Atlanta).  \n- **Credit quality:** Deterioration or rising delinquencies was frequently concentrated in **consumer portfolios** (Kansas City, St. Louis, Richmond), while business loan performance was typically stable or only modestly weaker, with a few exceptions where business delinquencies worsened (New York, some business loan quality issues in Chicago).",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements of the expected answer:\n1) Kansas City: expectations for 2026 optimistic, but consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately, indicating household stress; contrast with business.\n2) Chicago: business loan demand decreased slightly on net; consumer loan demand increased slightly with pickup in mortgage refinancing.\n3) Dallas: overall loan demand grew.\n4) St. Louis: banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions; consumer lending showed some signs of stress; business lending mixed.\n5) Overall contrast consumer vs business conditions across districts, focusing on these four districts.\n\nComparison:\n- The system correctly describes Kansas City: \"moderate deterioration specifically in consumer lending portfolios\" and no similar deterioration for business loans – aligns with the ground truth’s consumer stress vs others.\n- It correctly captures Chicago: \"Business loan demand decreased slightly\" and \"For consumers, loan demand increased slightly\" – this matches the expected answer, though it doesn’t explicitly mention mortgage refinancing but that’s a minor omission.\n- It gives a partially compatible but not fully aligned description of Dallas. Ground truth: \"loan demand grew overall.\" System: talks about tightened standards, easing for residential real estate, expectations, and some performance details but **does not state that loan demand grew overall**; it instead focuses on standards and performance. That key fact is missing, but it’s not contradicted.\n- For St. Louis, ground truth: banking activity unchanged, strong overall credit conditions, consumer lending some stress, business mixed. System: says commercial loan demand strong, small business depressed but rebuilding; consumer delinquencies increasing and broader tightening. That still conveys consumer stress vs relatively better or at least mixed business lending; it doesn’t contradict, though it emphasizes \"strong\" commercial demand rather than \"unchanged\" banking activity. Not clearly wrong, but not a tight match either.\n- The system adds many other districts (New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Francisco, Richmond, Cleveland) and a synthesized overall pattern. This extra material isn’t in the expected answer, but it is framed as \"from the context\" and appears to be plausible, not obviously contradictory to the expected content. There is no direct conflict with the ground truth’s description of the four highlighted districts.\n- The overall summary of patterns (business demand often weaker, consumer quality often worse) is consistent with the Kansas City/Chicago/St. Louis description in the expected answer.\n\nThe main issues are incompleteness (no explicit statement that Dallas loan demand grew overall; only partial alignment on St. Louis) and omission of the 2026 optimism detail for Kansas City. However, the facts given are not wrong, and some key contrasts consumer vs business are correctly drawn. This fits \"some key facts present, incomplete but not misleading\" → partially correct, not fully correct and not incorrect.\n",

There is no direct contradiction with the expected answer.\n\nHowever, key Chicago-specific facts (moderate producer price growth, moderate nonlabor cost increases in energy/raw materials, attribution of some raw materials price increases to tariffs in manufacturing) are only partially and vaguely captured by the general closing sentence. The closing sentence reflects the tariffs affecting goods-producing sectors idea, but lacks the Chicago framing and the detail on moderate overall price growth and specific categories. Thus, some but not all key facts are present, with no clear factual errors.\n\nTherefore, the answer is incomplete but generally aligned, so it is partially correct rather than fully correct.",

A staffing firm with multiple offices saw hiring decline at the end of summer after an earlier uptick. A staffing contact in Michigan's Upper Peninsula noted healthy labor demand in manufacturing, construction, and mining, but acknowledged that \"the uncertainty in the market has spurred more temp and temp-to-hire work in our area,\" rather than direct hiring. Hospitality and tourism firms reported that they were predominantly hiring to replace turnover; only one in ten were hiring new full-time employees, and a comparable share was cutting workers. However, recent unemployment claims across the District remained low overall. Montana employers reported healthy labor demand, but a contact said that \"most hiring is to replace vacancies rather than support business expansion.\" Artificial intelligence was expected to have a slight dampening effect on future labor demand. A Minnesota advertising firm said there \"will be a smaller need for entry-level folks\" because Al tools \"get this work done faster.\"",

In most Districts, more employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition, with contacts citing weaker demand, elevated economic uncertainty, and, in some cases, increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies. Employers that reported hiring generally noted improved labor availability, and some favored hiring temporary and part-time workers over offering full-time employment opportunities. Nevertheless, labor supply in the hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing sectors was reportedly strained in several Districts due to recent changes to immigration policies. Wages grew across all reporting Districts, generally at a modest to moderate pace, and labor cost pressures intensified in recent weeks due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses.",

Employment was flat (matching national stable levels). Wages and benefits costs were up modestly (matching national modest-to-moderate). Prices rose moderately (matching national rising trend). Financial conditions loosened slightly (better than mixed national picture). Construction/real estate increased slightly (better than mixed national). Farm income prospects unchanged. Compared to national trends, Chicago showed relative strength in financial conditions, construction, and consumer spending while manufacturing weakness aligned with broader trends.",
      "system_answer": "For the Chicago (Seventh) District, the key economic indicators and their directions were:\n\n- **Overall economic activity:** Flat / little changed.  \n- **Consumer spending:** Increased modestly.  \n- **Construction and real estate:** Increased slightly.  \n- **Employment:** Flat.  \n- **Nonbusiness (nonprofit/community) activity:** No change.  \n- **Business spending:** Declined slightly.  \n- **Manufacturing activity:** Declined modestly.  \n- **Prices:** Rose moderately.  \n- **Wages:** Up modestly.  \n- **Financial conditions:** Loosened slightly.  \n- **Prospects for 2025 farm income:** Unchanged.\n\nComparison to national trends (from the National Summary):\n\n- Nationally, **overall activity** also “changed little,” with many districts flat and some slightly up or down—so Chicago’s flat activity is in line with the national picture of little net change.\n- National **consumer spending** “inched down” overall, whereas **Chicago’s consumer spending increased modestly**, meaning Chicago outperformed the national trend in consumer spending.\n- Nationally, **manufacturing activity** was generally challenged and varied by district, often soft; **Chicago’s manufacturing declined modestly**, consistent with this generally weak national manufacturing environment.\n- National **prices** were rising, with many districts reporting moderate increases; Chicago’s **moderate price increases** match this pattern.\n- Nationally, **wage growth** was generally modest; **Chicago’s modest wage increases** are consistent with that.\n- National **agriculture** was “generally down” among reporting districts; in contrast, **Chicago’s 2025 farm income prospects were unchanged**, indicating relatively more stable expectations than the generally weaker national agriculture/related sectors.\n\nFor some indicators (construction/real estate, business spending, financial conditions specifically for Chicago versus national), the context does not provide a direct national comparison beyond the general note that interest‑rate‑sensitive sectors were “mixed” nationally.",

      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n- Overall activity: little changed, matching national “little change.”\n- Consumer spending: increased modestly, stronger than national (“inched down”).\n- Manufacturing: demand declined modestly, aligned with national challenging conditions.\n- Employment: flat, matching national stable levels.\n- Wages/benefits: up modestly, matching national modest-to-moderate.\n- Prices: rose moderately, matching national rising trend.\n- Financial conditions: loosened slightly, somewhat stronger than mixed national picture.\n- Construction/real estate: increased slightly, somewhat stronger than mixed national.\n- Farm income prospects: unchanged; relative to generally down nationally.\n- Overall comparative framing: Chicago relatively stronger in financial conditions, construction, consumer spending; manufacturing weakness aligned with national.\n\nCheck system answer:\n- Lists Chicago indicators: overall activity flat/little changed; consumer spending increased modestly; construction/real estate increased slightly; employment flat; manufacturing declined modestly; prices rose moderately; wages up modestly; financial conditions loosened slightly; farm income prospects unchanged. These all match the ground truth and add some extra local indicators (nonbusiness activity, business spending) that are not in the ground truth but are not contradictory or wrong with respect to it.\n\n- Comparison to national trends:\n  * Overall activity: says national activity “changed little” and Chicago’s flat is in line – matches.\n  * Consumer spending: says national spending inched down vs Chicago increased modestly – matches.\n  * Manufacturing: says national manufacturing was generally challenged/soft and Chicago declined modestly, consistent – matches.\n  * Prices: national prices rising moderately; Chicago moderate price increases – matches.\n  * Wages: national wage growth modest; Chicago modest – matches.\n  * Agriculture: national agriculture generally down; Chicago farm income prospects unchanged, indicating relatively more stability – matches the expected comparison.\n  * It notes that for construction/real estate, business spending, financial conditions, the context doesn’t provide direct national comparison beyond mixed interest‑rate‑sensitive sectors. The expected answer explicitly says financial conditions and construction/real estate were relatively stronger than the mixed national picture; the system answer is slightly more cautious here but not factually wrong—it does not contradict, just doesn’t fully emphasize the relative strength. It does correctly identify Chicago financial conditions as loosening slightly and construction/real estate as increasing slightly.\n\nAll key Chicago indicators and their directions are present and correct. The national comparison points that are explicitly made match the ground truth, and there are no factual errors or contradictions. The only difference is a minor omission of the explicit statement that Chicago’s financial conditions and construction/real estate were relatively stronger than the national mixed picture, but the answer remains accurate and not misleading.\n\nTherefore the answer is complete and accurate relative to the expected answer, with only minor differences in emphasis, not in fact.",
