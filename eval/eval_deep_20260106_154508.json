      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "answer": "Economic activity in the Twelfth Federal Reserve District (San Francisco) has recently softened slightly and become more uneven across sectors and states, with overall output edging down and employment roughly flat.\n\n**Current / Recent Pattern**\n\n- **Overall activity:**  \n  Reports for the San Francisco Fed region indicate that \u201ceconomic activity edged down slightly\u201d in the District. [Chunk: search_facts('\"In San Francisco\" Beige Book Twelfth District economic activity edged down slightly employment little changed', \u2026)]  \n  This points to a mild slowdown rather than a sharp contraction.\n\n- **Labor market:**  \n  Employment has mostly plateaued: \u201cemployment levels were little changed\u201d in San Francisco, and \u201cemployment in the District was down slightly compared with the last report,\u201d with surveys noting \u201cdeclining head count among District employers,\u201d partly due to seasonality. [Chunk: search_facts('San Francisco Fed district economic conditions GDP employment inflation', \u2026); search_facts('\"Twelfth District\" GDP employment unemployment population sectoral composition', \u2026)]  \n  Overall, labor demand is softer, especially for tech workers, but unemployment claims remain low, suggesting cooling rather than crisis. [Chunk: search_facts('Twelfth District COVID-19 recovery labor market 2020 2022', \u2026); search_facts('remote work tech sector San Francisco Seattle pandemic', \u2026)]\n\n- **Sector details (recent):**\n  - **Retail trade, agriculture, housing:** Activity in \u201cretail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable\u201d in San Francisco, implying stagnation or modest decline. [Chunk: search_facts('San Francisco Fed district economic conditions GDP employment inflation', \u2026)]  \n  Residential prices in Northern California \u201ceased,\u201d reflecting weaker housing demand. [Chunk: search_facts('\"Twelfth District\" housing boom bust California Nevada Arizona', \u2026)]\n  - **Business & consumer services:** Conditions described as \u201cmixed\u201d in both business and consumer services, pointing to some growth pockets but no broad-based strength. [Chunk: search_facts('San Francisco Fed district economic conditions GDP employment inflation', \u2026)]\n  - **Trade & agriculture:** Demand from abroad, \u201cparticularly from China, reportedly continued to fall because of trade policy adjustments,\u201d weighing on export-oriented agriculture and some manufacturing. [Chunk: search_facts('\"Twelfth District\" Asia-Pacific trade shocks', \u2026)]\n  - **Tourism & travel (including Hawaii):** Post\u2011COVID, demand for leisure and hospitality \u201cby international travelers fell further,\u201d and travel services demand declined, contributing to a weaker recovery in tourism hubs like Hawaii and parts of the West Coast. [Chunk: search_facts('Hawaii tourism collapse pandemic 2020 2021 recovery 2022 2023', \u2026)]\n  - **Technology and remote\u2011work\u2013related activity:** Demand for software and IT services remained strong in some areas, but \u201clabor demand remained soft for tech workers,\u201d indicating a shift toward productivity gains and selective hiring rather than broad expansion. [Chunk: search_facts('remote work tech sector San Francisco Seattle pandemic', \u2026); search_facts('San Francisco Fed Beige Book 2021 2022 Twelfth District remote work technology sector', \u2026)]\n\n**Broader Trend and Cyclical vs. Structural Elements**\n\n- **Cyclical softening:**  \n  Numerous references describe \u201csoftening activity across several sectors,\u201d \u201clittle changed\u201d or slightly down employment, and easing house prices\u2014consistent with a late\u2011cycle slowdown and tighter financial conditions rather than a collapse. [Chunk: Finding 3 summary; search_facts('\"Twelfth District\" Asia-Pacific trade shocks', \u2026)]\n  \n- **Structural shifts:**  \n  - Greater exposure to global trade\u2014especially Asia and China\u2014has made parts of the District more sensitive to trade policy and external demand; falling demand from China has damped exports for agriculture and some industrial goods. [Chunk: search_facts('\"Twelfth District\" Asia-Pacific trade shocks', \u2026)]\n  - Post\u2011COVID changes in work and travel patterns (rise of remote work, shifts in business travel, and consumers choosing closer, cheaper destinations) have structurally altered demand for office space and tourism in major West Coast metros and Hawaii. [Chunk: search_facts('FRBSF COVID-19 regional economic impact Twelfth District', \u2026); search_facts('tourism travel Hawaii Nevada post-pandemic recovery', \u2026)]\n\n**Post\u2011crisis recoveries (contextual history)**\n\n- **After the 2008\u201309 Great Recession:**  \n  The Twelfth District, particularly California, Nevada, and Arizona, was at the center of the housing boom\u2013bust. Recovery was \u201cweak\u201d and \u201csluggish\u201d in housing markets, with \u201chousing market activity remained weak,\u201d easing prices, and tight credit (\u201cdeterioration in the credit profiles of potential buyers made it difficult for many to qualify for financing\u201d). Construction employment faced headwinds. [Chunk: search_facts('Twelfth District Great Recession recovery housing labor', \u2026); search_facts('foreclosure crisis California Nevada Arizona 2008 2010', \u2026)]\n\n- **After the COVID\u201119 shock:**  \n  Output and jobs rebounded, but the recovery has been \u201cuneven\u201d:  \n  - Economic activity in San Francisco later \u201cedged down slightly\u201d rather than continuing strong post\u2011rebound growth. [Chunk: search_facts('FRBSF COVID-19 regional economic impact Twelfth District', \u2026)]  \n  - Labor markets cooled from very tight conditions, particularly in tech and interest\u2011sensitive sectors like construction and real estate. [Chunk: search_facts('Twelfth District COVID-19 recovery labor market 2020 2022', \u2026); search_facts('remote work tech sector San Francisco Seattle pandemic', \u2026)]  \n  - Tourism, especially international and middle\u2011market leisure, has recovered only partially and remains below pre\u2011pandemic strength. [Chunk: search_facts('Hawaii tourism collapse pandemic 2020 2021 recovery 2022 2023', \u2026)]\n\n**Magnitude and Direction (what we can and can\u2019t say)**\n\n- Directionally, the District has moved from strong post\u2011COVID rebound to **slight decline / flat activity**, **flat-to-slightly-down employment**, and localized weakness in housing, trade\u2011exposed agriculture, and tourism.\n- The evidence comes mainly from qualitative and high-frequency business reports (Beige Book\u2013type information). There are no precise GDP growth or unemployment rate figures in the provided chunks, so we cannot quantify exact percentage changes by year or over long historical periods.\n- Where the text references other Districts (e.g., Eleventh, Tenth) to characterize \u201csoftening\u201d or \u201cweak housing,\u201d those are useful analogs but not direct data for the Twelfth District itself; I rely only on Twelfth\u2011specific statements (San Francisco, Northern California, Hawaii, Alaska) for District\u2011level conclusions.\n\n**Summary**\n\nOver time, the Twelfth District has evolved from a boom\u2011and\u2011bust, housing\u2011driven pattern (pre\u20112008 and the Great Recession) to a post\u2011COVID environment characterized by:\n\n- Slightly **softening overall economic activity** and **mostly flat employment** in recent reporting. [Chunk: search_facts('San Francisco Fed district economic conditions GDP employment inflation', \u2026)]\n- **Weak or stagnant** conditions in retail, agriculture, housing, and parts of tourism.\n- **Mixed** but not uniformly strong performance in business and consumer services.\n- Ongoing **structural adjustments** linked to global trade patterns, housing corrections, and the shift to remote work and changed travel behavior.\n\nBecause the available evidence is qualitative and focused on recent reporting periods, a more granular, long\u2011run quantitative history (e.g., decade\u2011by\u2011decade GDP or employment growth) would require direct data pulls from BEA/BLS and San Francisco Fed statistical releases, which are not present in the provided chunks.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer has two key elements: (1) overall economic activity in the Twelfth District edged down slightly, and (2) retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or were stable. The agent explicitly states that overall activity \u201cedged down slightly\u201d and also repeats the sector detail about retail, agriculture, and residential real estate decreasing or remaining stable. Extra information about employment and other sectors is not required but does not contradict the expected answer.",

      "question": "What is the Beige Book?",
      "expected": "The Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication about current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It characterizes regional economic conditions and prospects based on a variety of mostly qualitative information, gathered directly from each District's sources.",
      "answer": "The Beige Book is a recurring report published by the U.S. Federal Reserve System that provides a qualitative summary of current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. Its official title is \u201cSummary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District.\u201d [Chunk: Finding 1]\n\nBelow are its key attributes:\n\n1. **Purpose and function**  \n   - The Beige Book\u2019s main function is to give a timely, largely anecdotal picture of how the economy is actually behaving on the ground in different regions and sectors.  \n   - It is based on \u201cmostly qualitative information\u201d gathered from businesses, labor contacts, community organizations, and others in each district. [Chunk: Finding 2]  \n   - This qualitative nature \u201ccreates an opportunity to characterize dynamics in the economy that may not be readily apparent in the available economic data\u201d and to \u201cidentify emerging trends.\u201d [Chunk: Finding 2]  \n   - Information from these contacts \u201csupplements the data and analysis used by Federal Reserve economists and staff to assess economic conditions\u201d and thus supports monetary policy deliberations. [Chunk: Finding 2]\n\n2. **Who prepares and publishes it**  \n   - It is a **Federal Reserve System** publication, labeled under \u201cFEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM\u201d in the document header. [Chunk: Finding 3]  \n   - Each of the 12 Federal Reserve District Banks gathers information \u201cdirectly from sources within\u201d its district, using a variety of formal and informal methods. [Chunk: Finding 3]  \n   - The district inputs are compiled into a system-wide summary organized by Federal Reserve District, as reflected in the subtitle \u201cby Federal Reserve District.\u201d [Chunks: Finding 1, Finding 3]  \n   - The report \u201cis not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials\u201d; it is a summary of outside contacts\u2019 reports. [Chunks: Finding 2, Finding 3, Finding 4]\n\n3. **Frequency and timing**  \n   - The Beige Book \u201cis published eight times per year.\u201d [Chunk: Finding 3]  \n   - It is typically released about two weeks before each scheduled meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), so that its information is available to policymakers and the public ahead of those meetings. [Chunk: Finding 3]\n\n4. **Content and structure**  \n   - The Beige Book \u201cdescribes current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts\u201d and \u201ccharacterizes regional economic conditions and economic prospects.\u201d [Chunks: Finding 2, Finding 3, Finding 4]  \n   - It is intended \u201cto characterize the change in economic conditions since the last report,\u201d not just the level of activity. [Chunk: Finding 4]  \n   - Information comes from \u201ca wide range of contacts\u201d and is organized by district; within those sections it often covers:\n     - Overall economic activity\n     - Labor markets, hiring demand, and wages (e.g., reports of \u201cwages grew \u2026 at a modest to moderate pace,\u201d \u201cwage pressures softened,\u201d and \u201cdemand for labor was generally muted\u201d) [Chunk: Finding 4]\n     - Prices and inflation pressures\n     - Consumer spending\n     - Manufacturing and services\n     - Real estate, banking, agriculture, and other key sectors  \n   - The report is largely narrative\u2014textual summaries rather than charts and tables\u2014because it is \u201cbased on a variety of mostly qualitative information.\u201d [Chunk: Finding 2]\n\n5. **Significance and use**  \n   - **For the Federal Reserve / FOMC:**  \n     - It provides near-real-time, ground-level intelligence that \u201csupplements\u201d statistical data and model-based analysis used by Fed economists and staff. [Chunk: Finding 2]  \n     - It helps identify \u201cemerging trends in the economy\u201d and regional differences that might not yet show up clearly in national statistics, informing the context for monetary policy decisions. [Chunks: Finding 2, Finding 4]\n   - **For markets and the public:**  \n     - Because it is public and closely tied to the FOMC meeting cycle, it is an important window into how conditions are evolving and what businesses and workers are experiencing.  \n     - Market participants, analysts, and journalists read it to gauge business sentiment, labor market tightness, wage and price pressures, and regional strengths/weaknesses, which can influence expectations about future Fed policy. [Chunk: Finding 4]  \n   - **Limitations / clarifications:**  \n     - It is explicitly \u201cnot a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials,\u201d so it should not be read as an official policy signal in itself. [Chunks: Finding 2, Finding 3, Finding 4]  \n     - It is primarily qualitative and anecdotal, so it is used to complement, not replace, formal economic data.\n\nIn summary: the Beige Book is the Federal Reserve\u2019s eight-times-a-year, district-by-district qualitative report\u2014officially titled *Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District*\u2014that compiles on-the-ground reports about current economic conditions and trends. It is prepared by the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, used by Fed staff and the FOMC alongside quantitative data, and widely followed by markets and the public as a timely indicator of regional and sectoral economic developments.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The agent accurately defines the Beige Book as a Federal Reserve System publication summarizing current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts, emphasizing its mostly qualitative, anecdotal nature and that it is compiled from information gathered by each District from local sources.

      "expected": "Economic activity changed little on balance since the previous report, with three Districts reporting slight to modest growth in activity, five reporting no change, and four noting a slight softening.",
      "answer": "According to the October 2025 Beige Book, overall economic activity was essentially flat, with only very small net changes compared with the prior report.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s national summary stated that:\n\n- **On balance, activity \u201cchanged little\u201d across Federal Reserve Districts** relative to the previous report, reflecting \u201ca mix of slight-to-modest growth, no change, and slight softening\u201d in different places and sectors [Chunk: search_facts({'query': 'Beige Book October 2025 overall economic activity characterized', 'top_k': 10})].\n\n- **There was a slight overall uptick**, driven mainly by **modest increases in consumer spending and manufacturing sales** [Chunk: search_facts({'query': '\"Summary of Economic Activity\" \"October 2025\" \"economic activity\"', 'top_k': 10})]. At the same time, many other sectors were reported as **generally flat** over the period [Chunk: search_facts({'query': '\"Summary of Economic Activity\" \"October 2025\" \"economic activity\"', 'top_k': 10})].\n\n- Within that flat national picture, **some areas softened**:  \n  - Retail trade and residential real estate activity \u201cdecreased somewhat,\u201d while **commercial real estate was unchanged on balance** [Chunk: search_facts({'query': '\"Summary of Economic Activity\" \"October 2025\" \"economic activity\"', 'top_k': 10})].  \n  - Several Districts (e.g., New York, Ninth, Tenth, San Francisco) reported **slight declines** or \u201cedged down slightly\u201d in overall activity [Chunk: search_facts({'query': '\"Beige Book\" \"slight\" \"economic activity\"', 'top_k': 20})].\n\nPutting this together, the October 2025 Beige Book characterized the change in overall economic activity as:\n\n- **Little changed in aggregate**,  \n- composed of **very modest growth in some sectors and regions**,  \n- **no change in many others**, and  \n- **slight softening or small declines in a few**.\n\nThere are no indications in the report of either strong expansion or sharp contraction; instead, it describes a broadly stable economy with mixed, generally small movements in either direction.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The agent captures the main qualitative point that economic activity \"changed little\"/was essentially flat and mixed across districts. However, it omits the key quantitative district breakdown (3 slight-to-modest growth, 5 no change, 4 slight softening) that the question/expected answer requires, and it introduces an unsupported claim of a \"slight overall uptick\" driven by consumer spending and manufacturing, which is not part of the expected summary.",

      "expected": "Three districts reported slight to modest growth: Boston (First District), Philadelphia (Third District), and Richmond (Fifth District).",
      "answer": "Districts described as having **slight to modest economic growth** are drawn from Federal Reserve\u2013style regional reports, which characterize conditions qualitatively rather than by exact GDP percentages.\n\nFrom those reports, the following districts/regions are explicitly associated with *slight* and/or *modest* growth in overall activity or key components (wages, prices, sectoral output):\n\n1. **Third District (Philadelphia Fed region)**  \n   - Reported that **\u201ceconomic activity \u2026 increased slightly after having risen modestly in the prior period\u201d** [Chunk: search_facts/'\"slight pickup in growth\" percentage' \u2192 Third District;

search_facts/'\"modest growth\" Federal Reserve Districts slight modest'].  \n   - **\u201cLoan volume \u2026 rose modestly over the reporting period\u201d** and **growth in the manufacturing sector \u2026 slowed to a modest pace** [Chunk: search_facts/'\"slight growth\" districts'; search_facts/'\"modest growth\" Federal Reserve Districts slight modest'].  \n   \u2192 The district is consistently described as having modest growth in several economic dimensions.\n\n5. **Richmond area (within the Fifth District)**  \n   - **\u201cThe regional economy grew modestly in recent weeks in the Richmond area.\u201d** [Chunk: search_facts/'subnational economic growth dataset NUTS3' \u2192 Richmond; search_facts/'\"modest growth\" Federal Reserve Districts slight modest'].  \n   \u2192 This is one of the clearest statements of modest overall regional economic growth.\n\n6. **Dallas area (within the Eleventh District)**  \n   - **\u201cIn the Dallas area, wage growth was modest during the period described.\u201d** [Chunk: search_facts/'subnational economic growth dataset NUTS3'; search_facts/'\"slight growth\" districts'].  \n   \u2192 Not overall GDP, but labor-market conditions show modest improvement.\n\n7. **Second District (New York Fed region)**  \n   - **\u201cWage growth in the Second District remained modest during the reporting period.\u201d** [Chunk: search_facts/'subnational economic growth dataset NUTS3'; search_facts/'\"modest growth\" Federal Reserve Districts slight modest'].  \n   \u2192 Suggests modest underlying economic momentum.\n\n8. **New York region (sub\u2011area of Second District)**  \n   - **\u201cIn the New York region, wage growth remained modest during the reported period.\u201d** [Chunk: search_facts/'subnational economic growth dataset NUTS3'; search_facts/'\"modest growth\" Federal Reserve Districts slight modest'].\n\n9. **Fifth District (Richmond Fed region overall)**  \n   - **\u201cWage growth remained moderate in the Fifth District in the most recent period\u201d** [Chunk: search_facts/'district real GDP growth latest year'; search_facts/'\"modest growth\" Federal Reserve Districts slight modest'].  \n   \u2192 \u201cModerate\u201d is slightly above \u201cmodest,\u201d but appears in the same family of subdued, non-robust growth descriptions.\n\n10. **Minneapolis District (Ninth District)**  \n    - **\u201cWage growth in the Minneapolis District remained moderate during the period described.\u201d** [Chunk: search_facts/'district real GDP growth latest year'; search_facts/'\"modest growth\" Federal Reserve Districts slight modest'].  \n    \u2192 Again, indicates subdued but positive labor-market growth.\n\n11. **All Federal Reserve Districts \u2013 general characterization**  \n    - One synthesis passage states that **\u201ceconomic activity changed little on balance across the Federal Reserve Districts \u2026 with a mix of slight-to-modest growth, no change, and slight softening reported.\u201d** [Chunk: search_facts/'\"slight-to-modest growth\" Federal Reserve Districts'].  \n    \u2192 This implies that several (not individually named in that sentence) districts were in the *slight\u2011to\u2011modest growth* category during the referenced period.\n\n---\n\nClarifications and limitations:\n\n- **Metric and timeframe:** The underlying documents largely describe **recent conditions over the last reporting period** in qualitative terms (wages, prices, sectoral output), not formal real GDP growth over a named calendar year.  \n- **No precise 1\u20135% GDP data:** Attempts to identify districts with **1\u20135% real GDP growth** in a specific year did not yield explicit district\u2011level GDP figures; instead, the reports rely on adjectives such as \u201cslight,\u201d \u201cmodest,\u201d \u201cmoderate\u201d for activity, wages, and prices [Finding 2; Finding 3].  \n- **Interpretation of \u201cslight to modest\u201d:** Economic literature and policy documents do not fix a universal numeric range, though \u201cmodest\u201d wage growth is sometimes exemplified as **1\u20133%** [Finding 1]. Thus, the districts listed above are those that the reports themselves label as having *slight* or *modest* growth, rather than those filtered by a hard numeric GDP threshold.\n\nIn sum, based on the available policy/report evidence rather than strict GDP data, the **Third, Fourth, Sixth, and Eleventh Federal Reserve Districts**, plus the **Richmond area, Dallas area, and parts of the Second (New York) District**, are explicitly described as experiencing **slight to modest economic growth or its close analogues in key indicators** during the most recent reported periods.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is that three districts\u2014Boston (First), Philadelphia (Third), and Richmond (Fifth)\u2014reported slight to modest economic growth. The agent\u2019s response does not include Boston/First District, and it adds multiple other districts (Fourth, Sixth, Eleventh, Second, Ninth) and even sub-areas, which are not part of the expected set. Although it mentions the Third District and references Richmond area/Fifth District, it fails to provide the correct complete list and introduces extraneous, unsupported districts.",

      "question": "What was the economic activity in the Seventh District (Chicago)?",
      "expected": "Economic activity in the Seventh District was flat. Consumer spending increased modestly; construction and real estate activity increased slightly; employment was flat; nonbusiness contacts saw no change in activity; business spending declined slightly; and manufacturing activity declined modestly.",
      "answer": "Economic activity in the Seventh Federal Reserve District (headquartered in Chicago) has been broadly flat in recent reporting, with modest wage growth, a softening but still functioning labor market, and mixed conditions across sectors.\n\n### Overall level of activity\n\nAcross the most recent Beige Book reporting period, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago characterizes the district\u2019s economy as essentially stable:\n\n- \u201cEconomic activity was little changed in the Seventh District over the reporting period.\u201d [Chunk: Finding1]  \nThis same assessment recurs across multiple pulls from the Beige Book and related summaries. [Chunk: Finding2, Finding3, Finding4]\n\nIn other words, the region is neither in clear expansion nor in broad contraction; conditions are best described as \u201cflat to slightly changing,\u201d with pockets of strength and weakness.\n\n### Labor market and wages\n\nEvidence points to a cooling but not collapsing labor market, both district\u2011wide and in the Chicago metro area:\n\n- Surveys \u201cfound softening labor demand among District employers.\u201d [Chunk: Finding2]  \n- \u201cWorkers and jobseekers in the region experienced an overall slower labor market.\u201d [Chunk: Finding4]  \n- A staffing contact in the (northern) part of the district reported that employers were \u201cpredominantly hiring to replace turnover rather than for new growth\u201d and that only about one in ten firms were adding full\u2011time workers, with a similar share cutting staff. [Chunk: Finding4]\n\nDespite softer demand, wage growth remains positive but modest:\n\n- \u201cWages grew slightly in recent weeks, similar to the previous reporting period and in line with reported past growth rates.\u201d [Chunk: Finding2]  \n- Wage pressures are described as \u201cmodest\u201d and \u201ccontinued to ease,\u201d with wage gains closer to pre\u2011pandemic norms than the very rapid increases seen earlier in the 2020s. [Chunk: Finding2]\n\nTaken together, employment is roughly flat and wage growth modest, suggesting a labor market that has cooled from its peak tightness but is not in severe distress.\n\n### Sectoral performance and main drivers\n\nThe Seventh District\u2019s economy is diversified\u2014anchored by manufacturing, services, finance and business services (especially around Chicago), logistics/transportation, and agriculture. The available evidence highlights:\n\n- **Overall sector pattern:**  \n  - Nonmanufacturing industries \u201creported a slight increase in activity, down from a moderate increase in the prior period,\u201d while \u201ceconomic activity was little changed\u201d overall. [Chunk: Finding3]  \n  This implies services are still growing slightly but at a slower pace.\n\n- **Manufacturing and industrial activity:**  \n  - The research notes flat to slightly positive manufacturing activity in the broader context\u2014\u201cmanufacturing activity in the district rose slightly, on net, since the previous report,\u201d though some firms reduced headcount while others hired. [Chunk: Finding3, Finding4]  \n  - In manufacturing tied to agricultural machinery, previously announced layoffs are expected to be \u201cweaker than last year,\u201d indicating some stabilization after prior weakness. [Chunk: Finding3, Finding4]\n\n- **Construction and real estate:**  \n  - \u201cConstruction employment faced headwinds amid the slowdown in commercial real estate and residential development activity.\u201d [Chunk: Finding2]  \n  - Office markets are under particular strain: \u201coffice vacancy rates increased somewhat as new supply outpaced demand\u201d and firms often sign \u201cshort\u2011term leases because of heightened uncertainty.\u201d [Chunk: Finding4]  \n  This is consistent with national post\u2011pandemic trends in downtown office demand, which are salient for Chicago\u2019s CBD.\n\n- **Small business and investment behavior:**  \n  - \u201cSmall businesses reduced investment during the period described,\u201d reflecting caution under economic uncertainty and higher financing costs. [Chunk: Finding2, Finding4]  \n\n- **Services and nonfinancial sectors:**  \n  - Nonmanufacturing (which covers a wide range of services) shows a \u201cslight increase in activity,\u201d but less robust than in prior reports. [Chunk: Finding3]  \n  - Labor shortages are less acute than previously, though still present in some lower\u2011wage segments like construction and manufacturing in parts of the district. [Chunk: Finding2]\n\nWhile the evidence is more qualitative than quantitative, it consistently describes a patchwork: modest growth in services, roughly flat manufacturing, and weaker commercial construction/office real estate.\n\n### Trends and structural patterns (last 5\u201310 years, with emphasis on recent years)\n\nOver the last several years\u2014particularly in the post\u2011COVID period\u2014the following patterns stand out:\n\n1. **From strong rebound to plateau:**  \n   - After the sharp pandemic downturn and rebound (2020\u20132022), current reports emphasize that \u201ceconomic activity was little changed\u201d and that growth is modest at best. [Chunk: Finding1, Finding2, Finding4]\n\n2. **Cooling labor market, still positive wages:**  \n   - The district is moving from a period of acute labor shortages and rapid wage gains to one where:\n     - Demand for labor is \u201csoftening\u201d and \u201coverall slower\u201d for job seekers. [Chunk: Finding2, Finding4]  \n     - Firms are largely hiring to backfill departures rather than to expand. [Chunk: Finding4]  \n     - Wage growth has decelerated to a modest, pre\u2011pandemic\u2011like pace. [Chunk: Finding2]\n\n3. **Commercial real estate adjustment, especially offices:**  \n   - New office supply has outpaced demand, raising vacancy rates. [Chunk: Finding4]  \n   - Heightened uncertainty and evolving remote/hybrid work patterns lead to shorter leases and more cautious space decisions. [Chunk: Finding4]  \n   These dynamics are particularly relevant to central Chicago, where office space is concentrated.\n\n4. **Cautious business investment:**  \n   - Small firms, in particular, have \u201creduced investment,\u201d and loan demand is generally described as muted in similar districts under \u201cpersistent economic uncertainty.\u201d [Chunk: Finding2]  \n   This suggests a more defensive posture rather than aggressive expansion.\n\n5. **Sectoral rebalancing and automation in manufacturing:**  \n   - References to \u201cdemand for automated manufacturers\u201d and \u201cexcess capacity\u201d among such firms, plus selective layoffs in manufacturing, point to ongoing automation and restructuring pressures. [Chunk: Finding4]\n\n### Overall regional economic health\n\nPutting these elements together:\n\n- Activity is **stable to slightly growing**, not booming and not in broad recession.  \n- The **labor market is cooling**, but employment is not collapsing; unemployment pressures are rising only gradually, while wage growth remains positive but modest.  \n- **Chicago and other metro areas in the district** (Detroit, Milwaukee, etc.) are wrestling with:\n  - Soft office and some commercial real estate markets,\n  - A transition from rapid post\u2011pandemic recovery to a more mature, low\u2011growth phase,\n  - Cautious investment by businesses, particularly small firms.\n\nThe main limitation in the evidence is that most of it comes from qualitative Beige Book\u2011style descriptions and not from detailed numerical indicators (unemployment rates, GDP growth by sector, etc.). That makes the assessment more directional than precise. Nonetheless, across multiple independent excerpts, the message is consistent: economic activity in the Seventh District, including Chicago, is essentially flat with modest wage gains, softening labor demand, and mixed sector\u2011by\u2011sector outcomes.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly states that overall Seventh District economic activity was broadly flat/little changed, matching the headline expected fact. However, it does not accurately match several sector-specific expected details and in some cases contradicts them: it suggests manufacturing rose slightly (expected: declined modestly), emphasizes construction/real estate headwinds rather than a slight increase (expected: increased slightly), and does not clearly report the expected modest increase in consumer spending, the slight decline in business spending, or that nonbusiness contacts saw no change in activity. Employment being roughly flat is aligned, but the rest is incomplete/mixed.",

      "question": "How did the Second District (New York) economy perform?",
      "expected": "Economic activity in the Second District continued to decline slightly. Employment held steady, and wage growth remained modest. The pace of price increases remained elevated but was little changed.",
      "answer": "The Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s Second District economy has recently been **sluggish to slightly contracting overall**, with **steady employment, modest wage gains, elevated but stable inflation, and only modest growth in consumer spending**, alongside **weaker credit demand and mixed sectoral performance**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Overall performance\n\nRecent reports indicate that **total economic activity in the Second District has been edging down**:\n\n- \u201cEconomic activity in the Second District continued to decline slightly during the reporting period\u201d [Chunk: Finding 1; search_facts \u2018Summary of Economic Conditions\u2019].\n- This occurred **even as** consumer spending and housing held up, suggesting a mild slowdown rather than a sharp contraction.\n\nAt the same time:\n\n- **Employment**: \u201cEmployment in the Second District held steady during the reporting period\u201d [Chunk: Finding 1; Finding 2].\n- **Wages**: \u201cWage growth in the Second District remained modest during the reporting period\u201d [Chunk: Finding 1; Finding 2; Finding 4].\n- **Prices**: \u201cThe pace of price increases in the Second District remained elevated but was little changed during the reporting period\u201d [Chunk: Finding 1; Finding 4].\n\nTaken together, the district is in a phase of **soft growth/near-stagnation**: output and activity are slightly down, but the labor market has not deteriorated sharply, and inflation pressures, while elevated, are not accelerating.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Labor market and wages\n\nOver the recent period (and consistent with broader post\u2011pandemic trends over the last several years):\n\n- **Employment level**  \n  - \u201cEmployment in the Second District held steady during the reporting period\u201d [Chunk: Finding 1; Finding 2; Finding 3].  \n  - Surveys also report that \u201cworkers and jobseekers in the region experienced an overall slower labor market\u201d and that there was \u201csoftening labor demand among District employers\u201d [Chunk: Finding 2].  \n  - This implies firms are **not yet shedding large numbers of workers**, but are **less aggressive in hiring**.\n\n- **Unemployment and claims**  \n  - \u201cRecent unemployment claims across the District remained low overall\u201d [Chunk: Finding 2].  \n  - Low claims plus flat employment suggests **a cooling, not collapsing, labor market.**\n\n- **Wages**  \n  - \u201cWage growth in the Second District remained modest during the reporting period\u201d [Chunk: Finding 2; Finding 4].  \n  - In context of elevated prices, this implies **real wage gains are limited**, which can constrain household spending power, especially for lower\u2011income households.\n\nOverall, the labor market has **transitioned from tight to merely stable/sluggish**: hiring and labor demand have softened, but no broad-based spike in unemployment has appeared so far.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Sectoral performance and industry mix\n\nPerformance varies by sector, with **services and tourism relatively stronger** and **manufacturing, finance, and real estate mixed or flat**.\n\n### a. Services and professional/business services\n\n- \u201cActivity in professional and business services picked up during the reporting period\u201d [Chunk: Finding 3].  \n- Nonmanufacturing industries \u201creported a slight increase in activity, down from a moderate increase in the prior period\u201d [Chunk: Finding 3].\n\nThis indicates **continued but decelerating expansion** in much of the service economy, which is central to the Second District\u2019s structure.\n\n### b. Finance and other interest\u2011rate\u2013sensitive sectors\n\n- \u201cActivity in the financial services sector and in other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, was mixed over the reporting period\u201d [Chunk: Finding 3].\n\nGiven the district\u2019s heavy exposure to **finance and real estate**, this \u201cmixed\u201d pattern\u2014neither strong growth nor severe contraction\u2014helps explain why **overall activity is only slightly declining** rather than sharply dropping.\n\n### c. Manufacturing\n\n- \u201cManufacturing activity in the Second District was little changed during the reporting period after experiencing a summer uptick\u201d [Chunk: Finding 1; Finding 3].\n\nManufacturing is **flat**: prior gains have stalled, contributing to the sense of stagnation but not to a major downturn.\n\n### d. Tourism and hospitality (especially New York City)\n\n- \u201cDomestic tourism in New York City continued to grow during the period described in the document\u201d [Chunk: Finding 3].\n- \u201cDemand for hotel rooms in New York City during the busy September season neared levels last seen in 2019\u201d [Chunk: Finding 3].\n\nDomestic tourism and hotel demand are **approaching pre\u2011pandemic levels**, supporting hospitality, retail, and local services, even as some international travel remains weaker.\n\n### e. Real estate and construction\n\n- \u201cHousing markets in the Second District remained solid during the reporting period\u201d [Chunk: Finding 1; Finding 4].\n- \u201cCommercial real estate activity in the District was described as mixed\u201d [Chunk: Finding 3], with brokers noting retail space \u201cperforming well\u201d but overall commercial activity \u201cmixed\u201d [Chunk: Finding 3].\n\nResidential housing is **solid**, likely supported by limited supply and still\u2011strong demand. **Commercial real estate is more uneven**, with strength in retail and more uncertainty or softness in segments like office.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Prices, inflation, and wages\n\nInflation remains a key macro backdrop:\n\n- \u201cThe pace of price increases in the Second District remained elevated but was little changed\u201d [Chunk: Finding 1; Finding 4].\n- \u201cInput prices in the Second District rose strongly during the reporting period\u201d and \u201cselling prices in the Second District rose moderately\u201d [Chunk: Finding 4].\n\nCombined with \u201cwage growth\u2026 remained modest\u201d [Chunk: Finding 4], this suggests:\n\n- **Cost pressures on firms are still significant**, particularly via input prices.\n- Households, especially those not seeing strong wage gains, are **likely feeling real income pressure**, even as headline inflation is no longer accelerating.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Consumer spending and household conditions\n\nConsumer behavior is **cautiously resilient but uneven across income groups**:\n\n- \u201cConsumer spending in the Second District increased modestly during the reporting period\u201d [Chunk: Finding 1; Finding 4].\n- \u201cThe modest increase in consumer spending\u2026 was partly due to the resilience of mid-to-upper-income households\u201d [Chunk: Finding 1; Finding 4].\n\nAt the same time, there are some signs of stress, especially lower down the income distribution:\n\n- \u201cDistrict banks reported moderate deterioration in consumer lending\u201d [Chunk: Finding 4].\n- \u201cA banker reported an increase in the number of people going to credit counseling agencies after borrowing to maintain requirements\u201d [Chunk: Finding 4].\n\nSo, **aggregate consumption is still growing modestly**, but:\n- Higher\u2011income households are doing most of the lifting.\n- Some households are **leaning more on credit, then seeking counseling**, which is consistent with **tight budgets under elevated prices and modest wage growth.**\n\n---\n\n## 6. Credit and financial conditions\n\nCredit indicators show a **cooling in loan demand and some deterioration in consumer credit quality**:\n\n- \u201cOverall loan demand in the Second District declined during the reporting period\u201d [Chunk: Finding 1; Finding 4].\n- \u201cDistrict banks reported moderate deterioration in consumer lending\u201d [Chunk: Finding 4].\n- Evidence of rising visits to credit counseling agencies after borrowing to \u201cmaintain requirements\u201d [Chunk: Finding 4].\n\nThis points to:\n\n- **Households and firms borrowing less**, possibly due to higher interest rates and uncertainty.\n- **Banks seeing more stress** among some borrowers, especially consumers.\n\nWeaker loan demand and tightening credit conditions feed back into slower economic activity, particularly in interest\u2011sensitive sectors.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Overall assessment and key drivers\n\nPutting these pieces together:\n\n- **Growth**: Overall activity is **slightly declining**, signaling a **late\u2011cycle or cooling phase** rather than a deep downturn. [Chunk: Finding 1; Finding 3].\n- **Labor market**: **Stable but softening**\u2014employment flat, low unemployment claims, slower hiring, modest wage growth [Chunk: Finding 2].\n- **Prices and incomes**: **Elevated but stable inflation** plus modest wage growth means **real income pressure**, especially for lower\u2011 and moderate\u2011income households [Chunk: Finding 4].\n- **Sectors**:\n  - Services and professional/business services: **picking up, but more slowly**.\n  - Tourism (NYC): **continuing to recover**, near pre\u2011COVID levels domestically.\n  - Manufacturing: **flat after prior uptick**.\n  - Finance and real estate: **mixed**, constrained by higher rates.\n  - Housing: **solid residential markets**, **mixed commercial real estate** [Chunk: Finding 3].\n- **Credit conditions**: **Lower loan demand and some deterioration in consumer credit quality**, suggesting **caution and strain** among borrowers [Chunk: Finding 4].\n\n### Main positive supports\n- Strength in **services and tourism**.\n- **Solid housing markets**.\n- **Low unemployment claims** and no widespread layoffs.\n- Resilient spending among **mid\u2011 and upper\u2011income households**.\n\n### Main drags and risks\n- **Elevated inflation** with **only modest wage growth**.\n- **Softening labor demand** and a **slower labor market** for jobseekers.\n- **Declining loan demand** and **deteriorating consumer credit**.\n- **Interest\u2011rate sensitivity** of key local sectors (finance, real estate).\n\n---\n\n## 8. Gaps and uncertainties\n\n- The findings mostly describe **recent reporting periods**, not a full, consistent decade\u2011long statistical series (e.g., annual GDP or unemployment for the last 10 years).\n- Precise quantitative figures for GDP growth, unemployment rates, or sector shares are not provided in the excerpts; instead, we have **directional and qualitative assessments** from Fed surveys and commentary.\n- Conditions can vary within the district (e.g., NYC vs. upstate NY vs. New Jersey vs. Puerto Rico); the evidence here is **district\u2011wide or NYC\u2011focused**, and may not fully capture all local divergences.\n\nWithin these limits, the evidence shows that the Second District economy has been **losing some momentum but remains relatively stable**, with **slight overall decline in activity**, **steady employment**, **modest wage gains**, **elevated but steady inflation**, and **sectoral and credit\u2011market frictions** shaping its current performance.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer has three key points: activity declined slightly, employment held steady with modest wage growth, and price increases remained elevated but little changed.

      "expected": "Overall consumer spending, particularly on retail goods, inched down in recent weeks.",
      "answer": "Overall consumer spending in the October 2025 report **slipped slightly / softened modestly**.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s October 2025 Beige Book (the report in question) described consumer spending as:\n\n- **Declining slightly over the recent period** \u2013 \u201cConsumer spending declined slightly over the past month\u201d and \u201cdeclined somewhat over the period described.\u201d [Chunk: search_facts('\"October 2025\" Beige Book consumer spending declined somewhat over the period described', top_k=10)]  \n- **Particularly weak in retail goods** \u2013 \u201cConsumer spending, particularly on retail goods, edged down in recent weeks across the Federal Reserve Districts.\u201d [Chunk: search_facts('\"October 2025\" consumer spending', top_k=8)]  \n- **With softer expectations for the rest of 2025** \u2013 \u201cContacts reported lower expected spending for the remainder of 2025,\u201d and retailers reported that **sales growth for the full year 2025 would be flat**. [Chunk: search_facts('\"October 2025\" personal consumption expenditures', top_k=10)]\n\nSome districts did note **modest increases** in spending (especially among mid\u2011 to upper\u2011income households and in services like travel and events), but the **overall national picture** in the October 2025 Beige Book was one of **slight overall decline/softening in consumer spending**, especially in retail, with expectations of **flat or weaker spending through the end of 2025**.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says overall consumer spending, particularly on retail goods, inched/edged down in recent weeks. The agent states consumer spending slipped slightly/softened modestly and explicitly notes it was particularly weak in retail goods, using essentially the same characterization (edged down). This matches the key point of the expected answer.",
