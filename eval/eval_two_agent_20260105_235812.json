      "answer": "## Direct Answer\nBased on the available evidence, I cannot answer which specific Federal Reserve Bank prepared the October 2025 Beige Book report because none of the provided evidence identifies a particular Reserve Bank as the preparer. The evidence only identifies it as a **Federal Reserve System** publication dated **October 2025**. \n\n## Supporting Evidence\n- The header information shows the report is titled \u201cThe Beige Book \u2026 October 2025\u201d and labels it as \u201cFEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM,\u201d but does **not** name any specific Federal Reserve Bank as the preparer. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: ed01c792-87ea-4517-98cc-75c4d1d65146]  \n- The description states the Beige Book is \u201ca Federal Reserve System publication\u201d describing conditions across the 12 Districts, with information gathered from each District\u2019s sources; it does **not** indicate which Reserve Bank \u201cprepared\u201d a particular issue. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 4768ba1c-f8bd-4e1c-9bf1-7a9e63c3904b]\n\n## Caveats\n- No evidence chunk provided includes language such as \u201cprepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of ___\u201d for the October 2025 Beige Book. Therefore, the preparer Reserve Bank cannot be determined from the evidence.

The search summary mentions that some districts (Second, Ninth, Tenth, and Twelfth/San Francisco) reported \u201cslight softening\u201d or a \u201cslight decline,\u201d but those statements are **not accompanied by any citable evidence chunks**.  \n\n### Supporting Evidence\n- There are **no collected evidence chunks** to cite (the \u201cCollected Evidence\u201d section is empty), so I cannot substantiate which districts reported softening/decline with the required citations.\n\n### Caveats\n- The search summary text references potential findings (e.g., Second District \u201cdecline slightly,\u201d Ninth District \u201cslightly down,\u201d Tenth District \u201cfell slightly/softening,\u201d Twelfth District/San Francisco \u201cedged down slightly\u201d), but without document/chunk citations, I cannot treat them as verified evidence under the rules.\n\n### Confidence\n- **Low** \u2014 the necessary cited evidence is missing (no documents/chunks provided).",

The agent did not provide those districts as an answer; instead, it stated it could not answer due to missing citable evidence chunks, even though it informally referenced the same districts in a non-committal way. As an impartial judge, the agent\u2019s response is best categorized as indicating the information was not found/usable under its constraints, rather than giving the correct list.",

[DOC: search_summary, CHUNK: none]\n\n## Supporting Evidence\n- The evidence collection process found **zero retrievable chunks**: \u201c**None**\u2026 zero chunk texts can be retrieved for `Seventh District`\u2026\u201d [DOC: search_summary, CHUNK: none]  \n- The `Seventh District` entity exists in the graph, but **has no relationships**, so there is no chunk-backed path to any description of economic activity. [DOC: search_summary, CHUNK: none]  \n- A highly relevant fact string was located (\u201c**Economic activity was little changed in the Seventh District over the reporting period**\u201d), but it is **not usable** because it lacked the needed fields (subject/edge_type/object/chunk_id), preventing chunk retrieval and citation. [DOC: search_summary, CHUNK: none]  \n- An edge from `Federal Reserve Bank Of Chicago` to `Economic Activity` appeared in exploration (with \u201cdoc: 2025-10-15\u201d), but attempts to retrieve the supporting chunk returned **NO EVIDENCE FOUND**, so this also cannot be cited. [DOC: search_summary, CHUNK: none]\n\n## Caveats\n- The evidence includes **only a search summary** describing failed retrieval attempts and does **not include any underlying document text** (e.g., Beige Book excerpt) that could be cited. [DOC: search_summary, CHUNK: none]  \n- While a fact string suggests \u201clittle changed\u201d activity, it cannot be treated as supported evidence because no chunk is available to verify or quote. [DOC: search_summary, CHUNK: none]\n\n## Confidence\n**Low.** The graph provided **no citeable evidence chunks**, so I cannot substantively describe economic activity in the Seventh District (Chicago) using the required evidence-only standard.

      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions amid rising prices and uncertainty. The agent captures the core idea of increased price sensitivity/value-seeking (\u201clooking for value, deals\u201d) which aligns with seeking discounts/promotions. However, it adds additional behaviors (greater credit use/credit counseling, increased reliance on assistance) that are not part of the expected key fact and may go beyond what\u2019s asked. It also doesn\u2019t explicitly mention \u201ccontinued to seek discounts and promotions\u201d as the main response, though it implies it.",

      "expected": "Manufacturing demand increased slightly in October and early November. Fabricated metals orders rose modestly, driven in part by growth in the automotive and defense sectors.",
      "answer": "## Direct Answer\nManufacturing demand in the Chicago (Seventh) District was driven mainly by **weaker demand from the automotive sector** (reducing machinery orders and fabricated metals sales) and **softness in construction-related demand** (lower fabricated metals sales), while **higher sales to a range of other sectors** and **some reshoring of steel production** provided partial offsets. Overall, the net result was a **modest decline in manufacturing demand**.  \n\n## Supporting Evidence\n- **Auto-sector weakness as a key drag**\n  - Machinery orders fell because \u201c**the decrease in machinery orders\u2026 was driven by a decline in demand from the auto sector for machinery**\u201d and \u201c**machinery orders decreased moderately**\u201d in late August and September. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]  \n  - Auto-related metals demand weakened: \u201c**Sales of fabricated metals to the automotive industry were lower**\u201d in late August and September.

[DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]  \n\n- **Construction softness weighed on manufactured inputs**\n  - \u201c**Sales of fabricated metals to the construction industry were lower**\u201d in late August and September. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]  \n\n- **Other sectors partially offset declines (especially in fabricated metals)**\n  - \u201c**Higher sales of fabricated metals to a range of sectors\u2026 were offset by lower sales to the construction and automotive industries**,\u201d leaving fabricated metals demand \u201c**unchanged on balance**.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]  \n\n- **Broader order conditions were soft/flat in some categories**\n  - \u201c**Metal fabricators noted a slowdown in orders**\u201d and \u201c**producers of parts for equipment manufacturers noted a slowdown in orders**.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]  \n  - \u201c**Steel orders were flat overall**\u201d in late August and September. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]  \n\n- **Potential support from reshoring**\n  - \u201c**A few contacts noted some reshoring of steel production**\u201d in late August and September. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]  \n\n- **Overall outcome for manufacturing demand**\n  - \u201c**Manufacturing demand declined modestly**\u201d / \u201c**demand for manufactured goods declined modestly**\u201d in recent months. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]  \n\n## Caveats\n- The evidence provided includes **no document IDs or chunk IDs** (\u201cNo evidence chunks were collected\u201d), so I can\u2019t provide the required citations in the specified format beyond noting they are unavailable. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]  \n- The evidence focuses heavily on **late August and September** conditions and on certain subsectors (machinery, fabricated metals, steel, autos), with limited detail on other manufacturing categories. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]  \n\n## Confidence\n**Moderate.** The drivers (auto weakness, construction softness, offsets from other sectors, modest overall decline) are explicitly stated in the provided evidence, but the lack of collectible chunk metadata and broader sector coverage limits precision.

      "verdict": "incorrect",

The agent instead claims manufacturing demand declined modestly and attributes drivers to weaker automotive demand and construction softness, with offsets from other sectors and reshoring.

      "question": "What challenges did manufacturers face regarding tariff policies?",
      "expected": "Several manufacturers noted that changing tariff policies were making it difficult to plan for the future.",
      "answer": "## Direct Answer\nManufacturers faced several challenges from tariff policies: incorrect or disputed tariff application and slow resolution, higher and sometimes opaque input-cost increases (including from suppliers invoking tariffs), difficulty passing higher costs through to customers due to competitive pressure, and in some cases softer demand that manufacturers attributed to tariffs.

[DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Prices, CHUNK: 1dd3406d-2581-4b9b-8c0d-08af9d564c86] Higher import duties also increased costs for imported supplies including **raw materials and electrical/electronic components**. [DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Prices, CHUNK: 51b92694-b33c-49d7-b751-083c1793636b]  \n- **Supplier behavior creating uncertainty/opacity:** Some suppliers were **citing tariffs when raising prices even if goods were not subject to increased levies**, contributing to cost pressures and confusion over what was truly tariff-driven. [DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia > Prices, CHUNK: 67b5be7d-e856-4126-b663-22211774d423]  \n- **Limited ability to pass through costs / pricing pressure:** While tariff-induced input cost increases were widespread, **pass-through to final prices varied**; some firms kept selling prices largely unchanged \u201cto preserve market share\u201d and due to \u201cpushback from price-sensitive clients.\u201d [DOC: Prices > Body (multi-District), CHUNK: 043f769e-14bb-4b3b-96a1-80cf228076e6] Relatedly, some manufacturers held prices steady despite higher costs to try to gain market share. [DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Prices, CHUNK: 1c89d67a-d500-495d-aac3-7a15d83651ab]  \n- **Demand impacts:** Manufacturers reported **modest declines in demand for goods**, which they **attributed to tariffs**. [DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Summary of Economic Activity, CHUNK: 6b748b97-7661-41ed-845f-99939e01859f]  \n- **Ongoing uncertainty / evolving impacts:** Firms reported a **wide range of tariff impacts** on costs and pricing, involving negotiations with suppliers and pass-through decisions; contacts warned tariff-related price pass-through \u201chas just begun\u201d and expected prices to rise into 2026. [DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta > Prices, CHUNK: d2ffd212-af9a-4d1a-ac0a-58dd9e4f7e72]  \n- **Mitigation burden (operational response):** Businesses reported working with vendors to **find alternative inputs to mitigate tariff impacts** and strategizing how to structure prices around new tariffs. [DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of New York > Prices, CHUNK: 1101ac88-f094-4319-9311-af852ad9dee7]\n\n## Caveats\n- The evidence provides qualitative reports across multiple Federal Reserve District summaries, but it does not quantify the magnitude of tariff costs, demand declines, or the frequency of misapplication disputes across the manufacturing sector. [DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Prices, CHUNK: f03c4324-4a78-4a36-bc58-ef288638d747; DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Summary of Economic Activity, CHUNK: 6b748b97-7661-41ed-845f-99939e01859f]\n\n## Confidence\nHigh that these were key challenges (each is directly described in the cited evidence), but medium on how representative they were across all manufacturers because the evidence is anecdotal and not comprehensive or quantified.

      "verdict": "partially_correct",

The agent listed several tariff-related challenges (cost increases, misapplication, pass-through limits, demand effects), which are plausible challenges but do not clearly state the key point about changing policies causing planning uncertainty/difficulty planning ahead.

      "answer": "Based on the available evidence, I cannot fully answer this question because no evidence chunks were actually provided to cite. The search summary references two chunk IDs and paraphrases what they contain, but without the underlying chunk text included in the \u201cCollected Evidence,\u201d I cannot make citable claims under the rule \u201cONLY use the evidence provided below.\u201d\n\n### What I can say from the *search summary only* (not citable as evidence)\n- It suggests employers became **more selective** in hiring, linked to existing workers being more likely to stay in their jobs (reduced churn).\n- It suggests jobseekers were **more likely than before** to receive **part-time offers with little or no benefits**, implying a shift toward part-time roles and reduced benefits.\n\n### Caveats\n- The actual evidence chunks were not included, so I cannot quote or cite them as required.\n- If you provide the text of chunks `6f38be0f-c2ed-4072-9c5c-9b5724fde1c2` and `f95bc350-b1a1-4400-a4ae-d7d3c28b7518` (or re-run with the chunks attached), I can produce a fully sourced answer.\n\n### Confidence\nLow\u2014because the underlying evidence text needed for citations is missing.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says employers noted improved labor availability and some preferred hiring temporary/part-time workers rather than full-time. The agent did not state improved labor availability, and it declined to give a definitive answer due to missing evidence. However, it did indicate (from the search summary) a shift toward part-time offers with reduced benefits, which aligns with the part-time/temporary preference portion. Because it captures only part of the expected change and misses improved labor availability (and does not clearly mention temporary vs full-time), it is only partially correct.",

      "answer": "## Direct Answer\nAcross Federal Reserve Districts, tariffs generally **raised input costs**, but **price pass-through to customers varied widely**: some firms held prices steady due to weak demand or price-sensitive customers, while others\u2014especially in **manufacturing and some retail segments**\u2014passed through much or all of the higher costs. In a few cases, **materials prices fell** (e.g., steel in the Sixth District and lumber in the Twelfth) due to waning demand, despite tariff-related cost pressures.

[DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 043f769e-14bb-4b3b-96a1-80cf228076e6]\n- Waning demand pushed down prices for some materials, including \u201csteel in the Sixth District\u201d and \u201clumber in the Twelfth District.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 043f769e-14bb-4b3b-96a1-80cf228076e6]\n\n### First District (Boston)\n- \u201cSmaller manufacturers passed through a larger share of tariff-induced cost increases to customers.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: ad5654c3-d67e-4143-8722-6e469110c0dd]\n- Contacts also worried about \u201ca possible acceleration of prices in 2026,\u201d tied to expected cost pressures. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: ad5654c3-d67e-4143-8722-6e469110c0dd]\n\n### Third District (Philadelphia)\n- Business contacts reported \u201ccontinued cost pressures from tariffs,\u201d and multiple contacts noted suppliers \u201cwere citing tariffs when raising prices, even if their goods were not subject to increased levies.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 67b5be7d-e856-4126-b663-22211774d423]\n- \u201cConsumer-facing businesses across sectors reported an inability to pass through all these\u201d cost increases (i.e., limited pass-through). [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 67b5be7d-e856-4126-b663-22211774d423]\n\n### Sixth District (Atlanta)\n- Firms reported \u201ca wide range of tariff impacts on operating costs and pricing,\u201d including negotiating with suppliers and passing through to customers.

[DOC: N/A, CHUNK: d2ffd212-af9a-4d1a-ac0a-58dd9e4f7e72]\n- Separately, steel prices fell in the Sixth District due to \u201cwaning demand,\u201d even as tariff-induced cost increases were reported broadly. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 043f769e-14bb-4b3b-96a1-80cf228076e6]\n\n### Seventh District (Chicago)\n- Manufacturing contacts attributed increases in metals prices (aluminum, copper, steel) to tariffs. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 1dd3406d-2581-4b9b-8c0d-08af9d564c86]\n- Retailers were \u201ctrying to hold off passing tariff-related cost increases\u2026 for as long as possible,\u201d but \u201cseveral smaller retailers reported already raising prices because of tariffs.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 1dd3406d-2581-4b9b-8c0d-08af9d564c86]\n\n### Ninth District (Minneapolis)\n- \u201cSeveral manufacturers reported that they recently increased prices in response to tariffs or planned future increases.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: e73412e9-d6ab-4359-8b6f-9375d3db8b68]\n\n### Fifth District (Richmond)\n- \u201cPrice growth picked up somewhat in manufacturing, with firms citing tariffs,\u201d though overall year-over-year price growth stayed \u201cwithin a moderate range.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: e7e8738d-fea3-4a75-bab7-d47a343cecf2]\n\n### Eleventh District (Dallas)\n- Selling prices rose \u201cmore sharply in the manufacturing sector due to the widespread impact of tariffs.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: f03c4324-4a78-4a36-bc58-ef288638d747]\n- Example of tariff application issues: a computer manufacturer said U.S. customs was applying steel and aluminum tariffs to products \u201cthat do not contain these metals,\u201d and challenges were taking time to resolve. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: f03c4324-4a78-4a36-bc58-ef288638d747]\n\n### Twelfth District (San Francisco)\n- \u201cHigher import duties led to a widespread cost increase for imported supplies\u201d (raw materials, electronic components, food). [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 51b92694-b33c-49d7-b751-083c1793636b]\n- \u201cMany suppliers absorbed some\u201d increases, but retailers passed \u201ca sizable portion\u201d to consumers, \u201cmostly in the mid to high-end markets.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 51b92694-b33c-49d7-b751-083c1793636b]\n- Separately, lumber prices in the Twelfth District were pushed down by \u201cwaning demand.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 043f769e-14bb-4b3b-96a1-80cf228076e6]\n\n## Caveats / Limits of the Evidence\n- The evidence does not provide a complete, uniform statement for **all 12 Districts**; it offers specific detail for some Districts (e.g., Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Richmond, Dallas, San Francisco) and a cross-district summary, but not a district-by-district accounting for every District. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 043f769e-14bb-4b3b-96a1-80cf228076e6]\n- The evidence describes directional impacts (cost increases, pass-through behavior) but provides **limited quantified price impacts** (one quantified example is a reported \u201c15 percent\u201d increase in a liability insurance policy, which is not specifically tariff-driven). [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 67b5be7d-e856-4126-b663-22211774d423]\n\n## Confidence\n**Moderate to high.** The cross-district chunk explicitly addresses tariff-driven input costs and mixed pass-through, and multiple District chunks corroborate the same mechanisms (absorption vs pass-through; stronger effects in manufacturing/retail; some demand-driven price declines for select materials).

[DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 686064d8-a6b3-4cc6-83e5-8fa693149ce0]  \n- The same section notes: **\u201cThe outlook remains slightly pessimistic.\u201d** [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 686064d8-a6b3-4cc6-83e5-8fa693149ce0]  \n- It also indicates that the **overall banking activity rating is partially illegible** (\u201cwith overall n n sn rated\u201d), limiting interpretability beyond the \u201cunchanged\u201d description. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 686064d8-a6b3-4cc6-83e5-8fa693149ce0]\n\n## 3) Caveats  \n- The evidence provided includes **only one St. Louis-specific chunk** on banking activity and does **not provide broader \u201cDistrict-wide\u201d (Eighth District) banking conditions** beyond the St. Louis area statement. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 686064d8-a6b3-4cc6-83e5-8fa693149ce0]  \n- Additional banking-related chunks in the evidence set are from **other Federal Reserve Districts (Kansas City, Richmond, Philadelphia, Dallas, New York)** and therefore cannot be used to characterize the St. Louis District\u2019s banking activity.

However, it gives the wrong time period (late August and September vs. October and early November). It also contradicts key expected details: the expected says equity rose while bond values and volatility were flat on balance, but the agent says both bond and equity values rose. Finally, the expected notes business loan volumes increased modestly, while the agent says business loan demand decreased slightly on net.",

Demand was generally **healthy**, but **trade policy volatility hurt exports**, and several major crops (e.g., **soybeans, wheat, corn**) were described as **depressed** in some contexts.

[DOC: N/A, CHUNK: a643edf5-cf2c-46bd-8f54-e270654b44ad] Another source described conditions as \u201c**considerably stronger, particularly for cattle producers**.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: b9fa3897-ea59-4b2b-8cc0-734ef0ab122e]  \n- **Farm finances/credit deterioration:** A lender survey found that **over 80%** of lenders in crop-heavy areas reported declines in **farm income and working capital** (vs **about 40%** in more cattle-oriented areas), and \u201c**agricultural credit conditions deteriorated**.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: b9fa3897-ea59-4b2b-8cc0-734ef0ab122e]  \n- **Some districts \u201cin good shape,\u201d but weather mixed:** One report said agriculture was \u201c**in good shape across most of the District**,\u201d with **dry conditions** that \u201c**assisted harvest but hurt yields** in some cases. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 6f38be0f-c2ed-4072-9c5c-9b5724fde1c2]  \n- **Commodity price signals (mixed):** In one district, **soybean prices were lower** and **corn prices were down** (despite strong exports), while **cattle and hog prices increased to record territory** and **milk and egg prices declined**. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 6f38be0f-c2ed-4072-9c5c-9b5724fde1c2] Another price list noted prices increased year-over-year for **canola, sunflowers, cattle, hogs, turkeys**, but decreased for **soybeans, wheat, pulse crops, hay, chickens, eggs, milk**. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: e73412e9-d6ab-4359-8b6f-9375d3db8b68]  \n- **Demand/trade dynamics:** Contacts reported **overall demand was healthy**, but \u201c**trade policy volatility weighed on agricultural exports**.\u201d Overseas **rice** sales declined as buyers sourced cheaper alternatives, and **soybean, wheat, and corn remained depressed** as Chinese markets turned to Brazil; meanwhile, **domestic demand** was strong for **beef, poultry, peanuts, and tobacco**. **Dairy** sales were flat year-over-year and retail dairy sales were stable.

[DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]\n\n## Supporting Evidence\n- The evidence summary contains a direct statement: **\u201cProspects for 2025 farm income were unchanged.\u201d** [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]\n- Context in the evidence suggests ongoing profitability pressure that helps frame those \u201cunchanged\u201d prospects:\n  - **Low crop prices** were \u201cweighing down producer incomes,\u201d and **cotton and grain prices** were \u201cat sub-profitable levels for producers.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]\n  - **Elevated expenses** were also \u201cweighing down producer incomes.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]\n  - Farm financial conditions reported by lenders were weak: **over 80% of lenders in crop-heavy areas** and **about 40% in more cattle-focused areas** reported **declines in farm income and working capital**, and **agricultural credit conditions deteriorated**. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]\n  - Production indicators were generally strong (which can support income even when prices are low): **corn production expected to set new records**, **soybean harvests very strong**, and **export volumes for corn were strong**, though **corn prices were down despite strong export volumes**. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]\n\n## Caveats\n- No actual evidence chunks (with document IDs and chunk IDs) were provided\u2014only a narrative \u201csearch summary.\u201d Because of that, I cannot cite the underlying source documents for the key statement that prospects were unchanged, nor can I confirm timing, definitions (e.g., what \u201cunchanged\u201d is relative to), or the full context from the original reports. The only specific chunk ID shown (6f38be0f-\u2026) relates to dry conditions and general agricultural shape, not directly to 2025 income prospects. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 6f38be0f-c2ed-4072-9c5c-9b5724fde1c2]\n\n## Confidence\n**Low.** The answer is directly stated in the provided summary (\u201cunchanged\u201d), but the underlying evidence chunks were not supplied, limiting verifiability and preventing precise sourcing.

      "answer": "## Direct Answer\nBased on the available evidence, I cannot fully answer \u201cHow did energy activity perform?\u201d because there is no direct, comprehensive measure of energy activity (e.g., drilling levels, production, rig counts, revenues, or broad sector output). The only evidence provided speaks to **energy-sector employment and operational efficiency**, indicating **head counts dipped further** in the energy sector during the reporting period. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 1da98393-e377-4859-8909-1c162c209dc9]\n\n## Supporting Evidence\n- The evidence states: \u201c**Head counts dipped further in the energy sector** as companies continued to find ways to complete more wells in less time and with fewer people.\u201d This implies companies were achieving operational efficiency (completing more wells faster with fewer workers) while reducing staffing. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 1da98393-e377-4859-8909-1c162c209dc9]\n- More broadly, the same source notes \u201c**Employment fell over the reporting period**,\u201d providing context that the decline was not limited only to energy. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 1da98393-e377-4859-8909-1c162c209dc9]\n\n## Caveats\n- The evidence does **not** provide direct indicators of \u201cenergy activity performance\u201d such as changes in drilling/well completion volumes, oil and gas output, capital spending, prices, profitability, or regional \u201cenergy activity\u201d indices. It only covers employment and a qualitative statement about completing wells more efficiently. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 1da98393-e377-4859-8909-1c162c209dc9]\n- The search summary mentions other potential statements (e.g., \u201cexpanded moderately,\u201d \u201cfell modestly\u201d), but **no retrievable supporting chunks** were provided for them, so they cannot be used. (No citable evidence supplied.)\n\n## Confidence\n**Low.** The conclusion is supported only with respect to **energy-sector headcount trends and efficiency**, not overall energy activity performance. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 1da98393-e377-4859-8909-1c162c209dc9]",

[DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > CommunityConditions, CHUNK: f95bc350-b1a1-4400-a4ae-d7d3c28b7518]  \n- Broader labor-market context (not specific to Cleveland) indicates employment was \u201clargely stable,\u201d but more employers reported **lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition** amid weaker demand and uncertainty. [DOC: LaborMarkets > Body, CHUNK: 28a65da3-1200-483a-aaf6-8524f21300d1]\n\n## Caveats  \n- The evidence does **not** provide a quantified change (e.g., number of nonprofit jobs gained/lost) for the Cleveland District; it only describes staffing behavior (not filling vacancies) and related funding conditions. [DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > CommunityConditions, CHUNK: f95bc350-b1a1-4400-a4ae-d7d3c28b7518]  \n- A statement that \u201cNonprofits noted trimming head counts\u201d was referenced in the search summary, but no retrievable source chunk was provided for it, so it cannot be used as evidence here. (No citable chunk available)\n\n## Confidence  \n**Moderate.** The conclusion that nonprofit staffing softened via unfilled vacancies is directly supported for the Cleveland/Fourth District. [DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > CommunityConditions, CHUNK: f95bc350-b1a1-4400-a4ae-d7d3c28b7518] However, the evidence does not quantify employment changes or confirm district-wide headcount cuts.",

(No chunk ID provided for the St. Louis line in the evidence summary.)\n- **General (non-district) statements exist but do not identify districts with both themes:**\n  - Manufacturing contacts attributed declines in demand to tariffs [DOC: unknown, CHUNK: 6b748b97-7661-41ed-845f-99939e01859f].\n  - Firms cited tariffs as contributing to manufacturing price growth [DOC: unknown, CHUNK: e7e8738d-fea3-4a75-bab7-d47a343cecf2].\n  - Manufacturing contacts reported labor shortages tied to deportation fears (immigration enforcement-related), but the evidence provided does not specify the district for this statement [DOC: unknown, CHUNK: 21e55294-0a82-4f44-a3eb-327af31bd715].\n  - Business contacts highlighted immigration policies as a potential source of labor market disruption, without tying it to a specific district in the provided evidence [DOC: unknown, CHUNK: ffcdd44a-cad7-48d3-b70d-9c09162f84f8].\n\n## Caveats\n- No evidence chunks were actually collected, and several key district-scoped statements in the search summary lack document IDs and chunk IDs (e.g., the Third District tariff lines; the St. Louis area immigration line). This prevents reliably matching districts to both conditions under the \u201cevery claim must cite its source\u201d requirement.\n- The evidence contains **district-scoped** information for tariffs (Third District) and **area-scoped** information for immigration labor shortages (St. Louis area), but it does not provide a single district with **both** themes explicitly linked.\n\n## Confidence\nLow. The evidence presented does not contain an explicit, citable link showing any one district discussed **both** tariff impacts on manufacturing **and** immigration-policy-driven labor shortages.",

      "expected": "Higher-income individuals maintained strong spending on luxury travel and accommodation. Lower- and middle-income households sought discounts and promotions due to rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. This bifurcation was driven by rising prices eroding purchasing power for lower/middle-income groups while higher-income groups remained insulated.",
      "answer": "## Direct Answer\nConsumer spending showed a clear split by income: **lower-income households became more price-sensitive and reduced or became more selective in spending**, **middle-income consumers maintained spending partly by using credit but became more cautious**, and **mid-to-upper-/upper-income consumers remained relatively resilient, supporting stronger sales and continued spending on travel/events/luxury**. These differences were driven primarily by **price sensitivity and economic security concerns for lower-income households**, **credit reliance and related stress for middle-income consumers**, and **greater resilience/ability to absorb higher prices among higher-income consumers**, alongside **price pressures (including import-duty/tariff-related costs) and consumer resistance to price increases**.

[DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Summary of Economic Activity, CHUNK: ac3eccab-525f-445f-8389-91c3441073e7]\n- The graph summary (relationship facts) describes lower-income/low-to-moderate-income households as **more selective and deal-focused** and as **taking steps to reduce spending where possible**, attributing this to **heightened price sensitivity** (relationship facts listed in the provided evidence summary). [DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Summary of Economic Activity, CHUNK: ac3eccab-525f-445f-8389-91c3441073e7]\n- Risks that would disproportionately affect lower-income households were cited in the relationship facts, including potential impacts from **SNAP/Medicaid cuts** and **tariff-linked consumer price increases** (as summarized in the collected evidence narrative). [DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Summary of Economic Activity, CHUNK: ac3eccab-525f-445f-8389-91c3441073e7]\n\n### Middle-income consumers: spending supported by credit but rising caution due to borrowing stress\n- The evidence summary indicates **middle-income consumers were increasingly cautious and had been using credit to maintain spending levels** (relationship fact in the provided summary). [DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis > Banking and Finance, CHUNK: 01f0d79a-4db9-4f39-8b3a-dec042215794]\n- A supporting signal of credit strain is provided by a banker report of **more people going to credit counseling after borrowing to maintain requirements**, consistent with a \u201ccredit-supported but stressed\u201d consumer dynamic. [DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis > Banking and Finance, CHUNK: 01f0d79a-4db9-4f39-8b3a-dec042215794]\n\n### Mid-to-upper-/upper-income consumers: resilience and continued discretionary spending\n- A department store reported strengthening sales **\u201cdue in part to resilience among mid-to-upper-income consumers,\u201d** directly supporting stronger consumption among higher-income groups. [DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of New York > Prices, CHUNK: 1101ac88-f094-4319-9311-af852ad9dee7]\n- The evidence summary also describes **upper-income households continuing to spend on travel, events, and luxury services** (relationship facts in the provided summary), consistent with the \u201cresilience\u201d described above. [DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of New York > Prices, CHUNK: 1101ac88-f094-4319-9311-af852ad9dee7]\n\n### Price pressures and pass-through: different impacts by market segment (proxy for income differences)\n- Retailers reported passing **import-duty-related cost increases** onto consumers **\u201cmostly in the mid to high-end markets,\u201d** implying higher-end consumers were encountering (and presumably more able to absorb) price increases in those segments. [DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Prices, CHUNK: 51b92694-b33c-49d7-b751-083c1793636b]\n- At the same time, restaurants faced **\u201cstrong resistance to higher menu prices,\u201d** leading some to reduce portion sizes or change recipes\u2014evidence of consumer price sensitivity affecting purchasing behavior. [DOC: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Prices, CHUNK: 51b92694-b33c-49d7-b751-083c1793636b]\n\n## Caveats\n- Several key statements about income-group behaviors (e.g., \u201clower-income households became more selective,\u201d \u201cmiddle-income consumers used credit to maintain spending,\u201d \u201cupper-income households continued spending on travel/luxury\u201d) appear in the provided **relationship-fact summary** but are not all accompanied by directly quoted source passages beyond the specific retrieved chunks shown above. Where possible, I anchored drivers to the retrieved text (economic security concerns; credit counseling; mid-to-upper-income resilience; import-duty pass-through and menu-price resistance).

      "question": "Which specific sectors reported labor shortages due to immigration policies, and in which districts was this most prominently mentioned?",
      "expected": "Four sectors reported labor shortages due to immigration policy changes: hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing. The St. Louis District explicitly stated that contacts continue to report immigration policies resulting in labor shortages. The Boston District noted retail and tourism contacts worried about next summer's labor supply given expected reductions in seasonal visas, with Maine and Vermont seeing increased labor market slack.",
      "answer": "## Direct Answer\nBased on the available evidence, the sectors that reported labor shortages tied to immigration policies/enforcement were **manufacturing, construction, and agriculture**, with impacts also noted as concentrated in **hospitality**. The location most prominently and specifically mentioned was the **St. Louis area**; other references only say \u201cthe District\u201d without identifying which district. **However, no source document IDs or chunk IDs were provided in the collected evidence, so I cannot cite the underlying text as required.**\n\n## Supporting Evidence (what the provided summary says)\n- **Sectors linked to labor shortages due to immigration/deportation fears**\n  - \u201cWorkers not reporting to work because of fears of deportation are contributing to labor shortages in **manufacturing, construction, and agriculture**.\u201d *(as summarized in the search results; no DOC/CHUNK provided)*\n  - Contacts in **agriculture**, **construction**, and **manufacturing** \u201creported labor shortages that they attribute to workers not reporting to work because of fears of deportation.\u201d *(as summarized; no DOC/CHUNK provided)*\n  - \u201cImpacts from changes to immigration policy and enforcement on labor markets were concentrated in sectors such as **agriculture**\u201d and **\u201chospitality.\u201d** *(as summarized; no DOC/CHUNK provided)*\n\n- **Where it was most prominently mentioned**\n  - \u201cContacts report that immigration policies have been resulting in labor shortages in the **St. Louis area**.\u201d *(as summarized; no DOC/CHUNK provided)*\n  - A generic statement indicates impacts in \u201c**the District**\u201d but does not name the district. *(as summarized; no DOC/CHUNK provided)*\n\n## Caveats\n- **No evidence chunks were collected**, and the summary does **not include any document IDs or chunk IDs**, so I **cannot provide the required citations** in the format [DOC: doc_id, CHUNK: chunk_id].  \n- The evidence **does not identify specific Federal Reserve district names** tied to these shortages (other than referencing the **St. Louis area** and an unspecified \u201cDistrict\u201d), so I cannot definitively map the mentions to particular districts using the provided material.\n\n## Confidence\n**Low to moderate.** The sector and St. Louis-area statements are clearly described in the provided summary, but the inability to cite DOC/CHUNK evidence and the lack of explicit district identification materially limit how firmly this can be supported.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer requires four sectors (hospitality, agriculture, construction, manufacturing) and two district mentions (St. Louis and Boston, with details about Maine/Vermont slack and seasonal visas). The agent identified the four sectors (though phrased as manufacturing, construction, agriculture and \"impacts\" in hospitality) and correctly highlighted St. Louis as prominently mentioned. However, the agent failed to identify the Boston District and its specific note about retail/tourism, seasonal visas, and Maine/Vermont slack. Therefore, the response is incomplete but not wrong on the elements it does provide.",

      "answer": "## Direct Answer\nFirms\u2019 pricing responses to tariff-induced cost increases varied by sector: **manufacturers (especially smaller ones) more often raised prices/passed through costs**, **retailers frequently delayed or used selective increases/discounting**, **auto manufacturers sometimes absorbed costs to protect demand**, and **some service firms reported the ability to raise prices without customer pushback**. In addition, **some foreign producers cut prices to retain market share**.

The housing market's response to lower rates was more muted than commercial sectors.",
      "answer": "## Direct Answer\nAcross districts, lower interest rates had **mixed effects** on interest rate\u2011sensitive sectors: some contacts reported **improved business lending**, while others continued to report **muted activity** in interest rate\u2011sensitive areas such as **residential and commercial real estate**. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 3646cbc5-e26e-4a3e-a93d-e02a15712054] Separately, at least one district contact expected **lower mortgage rates** to **increase mortgage demand**, prompting additional hiring of loan originators. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: cd5275f2-8e7c-4fc5-a668-406095fd5ea9]\n\n## Supporting Evidence\n- A cross\u2011district synthesis states that \u201c**financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed**,\u201d noting that \u201c**some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity**.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 3646cbc5-e26e-4a3e-a93d-e02a15712054]\n- In the Cleveland District\u2019s labor market commentary, \u201c**one banker reported hiring loan originators in anticipation of lower mortgage rates increasing demand**,\u201d indicating expectations of stronger mortgage activity as rates decline. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: cd5275f2-8e7c-4fc5-a668-406095fd5ea9]\n\n## Caveats\n- The evidence does **not** provide a district-by-district breakdown of which specific districts saw improvements versus muted conditions in each sector; it only states outcomes were \u201cmixed\u201d and provides one example from Cleveland.

[DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 3646cbc5-e26e-4a3e-a93d-e02a15712054]\n\n## Confidence\n**Moderate.** The answer is directly supported for the *direction* of effects (mixed; some lending improvement; mortgage demand expected to rise), but the available evidence is limited in scope and district detail.

The agent correctly conveys the general theme that effects were mixed, with some improved business lending and muted activity in residential/commercial real estate, and gives a Cleveland example related to mortgage demand.

      "question": "How did federal funding changes affect employment in specific sectors?",
      "expected": "Federal funding changes negatively impacted employment across multiple sectors: In Boston, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in education and health-care sectors. In Cleveland, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to federal grant uncertainty. In New York, nonprofits faced challenges from reduced federal benefit programs, with community health-care centers reporting financial strain. Manufacturing employment in Boston was mixed, with one firm shedding workers to offset tariff-related cost increases.",
      "answer": "## Direct Answer\nBased on the available evidence, **federal funding changes affected employment most directly in education, health care, and nonprofits** by contributing to **layoffs** (education and health care) and to **positions going unfilled** due to **grant uncertainty** (nonprofits). More generally, **uncertainty about federal funding** was associated with **slowing previously planned projects**, which can reduce labor demand, but the evidence does not specify which sectors those slowed projects occurred in. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]; [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: f95bc350-b1a1-4400-a4ae-d7d3c28b7518]\n\n---\n\n## Supporting Evidence (by sector)\n\n### Education\n- The evidence explicitly states that **\u201cCuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education sector.\u201d** [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]\n\n### Health care\n- The evidence explicitly states that **\u201cCuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the health-care sector.\u201d** [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]\n\n### Nonprofit sector\n- A survey respondent reported that the **nonprofit sector was \u201cnot filling open positions\u201d because of \u201cuncertainty around federal grants.\u201d** [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: f95bc350-b1a1-4400-a4ae-d7d3c28b7518]\n- Neighbor exploration also links the nonprofit sector\u2019s grant-related uncertainty to employment impacts via edges indicating the sector **\u201cwas not filling [positions] due to uncertainty around federal\u201d** (grants/funding), connecting to **Employment**. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]\n\n---\n\n## Broader (sector-unspecified) mechanism\n- The evidence indicates that **uncertainty about federal funding** was associated with **slowing previously planned projects**, including a statement that \u201cuncertainty surrounding the status of federal funding continued to slow previously planned projects.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]\n- This supports a channel through which federal funding changes could affect employment (via delayed work), but the evidence **does not identify the sectors** where these slowed projects occurred. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]\n\n---\n\n## Caveats / Limits of the Evidence\n- Several key statements (including the education/health-care layoff links and the \u201cslowed projects\u201d links) are provided **without document IDs or chunk IDs**, so I cannot attribute them more specifically than shown. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]\n- The evidence **does not quantify** the employment impact (e.g., number of layoffs, magnitude of hiring pullbacks). [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: N/A]\n- The evidence includes manufacturing employment changes (headcount reductions/offsetting hiring), but it **does not connect those changes to federal funding**. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: b6f03be1-14d2-44ab-8367-743f51633d1c]\n\n---\n\n## Confidence\n**Medium.** The directional impacts are clearly stated for **education, health care, and nonprofits** (layoffs or unfilled roles tied to grant cuts/uncertainty), but confidence is limited by missing doc/chunk metadata for several claims and by the lack of quantification and sector detail for the \u201cslowed projects\u201d mechanism.

Heavy truck production fell slightly amid soft freight volumes. Auto production was flat despite fabricated metals orders rising modestly due to automotive sector demand.",
      "answer": "## Direct Answer  \nBased on the available evidence, the supply-chain-related disruptions affecting manufacturing were **higher shipping and logistics costs** and **tariff-related pressures**, and they **changed how firms configured production/assembly** rather than showing explicit production stoppages or output losses in the retrieved text. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 75f27863-f754-4056-80b2-cf018bd5292c; DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 6b748b97-7661-41ed-845f-99939e01859f]\n\n## Supporting Evidence  \n- **Shipping/logistics cost shock \u2192 production/assembly reconfiguration:** Manufacturing contacts reported \u201cbuilding multiple facilities\u2026 to offset shipping and logistics costs\u201d and using strategies such as \u201cshipping unfinished goods to the U.S. for final assembly,\u201d indicating a direct operational change in where production steps occur.

This reflects trade frictions affecting manufacturing conditions, though the chunk does not specify a direct production-volume impact. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 6b748b97-7661-41ed-845f-99939e01859f]\n\n## Caveats  \n- The evidence **does not contain explicit statements** that manufacturing production was curtailed due to **missing parts, delivery delays, input shortages, or plant shutdowns**. It mainly documents **cost-driven supply/logistics pressures and resulting operational adjustments** (e.g., multi-facility setups, shifting final assembly). [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 75f27863-f754-4056-80b2-cf018bd5292c]  \n- Other retrieved chunks discuss labor/industrial production conditions, but **do not link these directly to supply chain disruptions**, so they cannot be used to attribute production impacts to supply chain issues.

      "question": "Which retail categories saw gains versus declines, and how does this reflect consumer behavior patterns?",
      "expected": "In Chicago: Categories seeing gains included computers, appliances, personal services (salons, spas), and discount/value-oriented stores. Categories seeing declines included apparel and grocery segments. This pattern reflects consumers seeking value (discount stores growing) while cutting back on essentials (grocery) and discretionary items (apparel), while still spending on technology and personal services. Retail corridors catering to higher-earning consumers continued to experience robust growth.",
      "answer": "## Direct Answer\nBased on the available evidence, **gains/resilience were seen in restaurant spending (including fast casual/fast food/family dining) and in the luxury end of retail (particularly Manhattan luxury)**, while **declines/weakness were concentrated in retail goods overall and several durable/home-related store categories (furniture, electronics/appliances, building materials/garden equipment)**, alongside **softness in travel-related spending (airlines, hotels) and weaker tourist-area retail due to slower foot traffic**. This pattern reflects **a shift toward services, heightened price sensitivity (especially among lower-income consumers), and a bifurcation where upper-income consumers continue to spend on luxury**. Within restaurants specifically, consumers appear **more value-conscious (skipping desserts and alcoholic beverages) despite higher overall spending**.

(These are in the retrieved graph facts, but no underlying document chunks were provided to cite.)\n- **Travel-related softness and tourist-area retail impacts:** The evidence set indicates softness in **airlines** and **hotels**, and that **travel-related retail spending was lower in tourist destinations due to slower foot traffic**. (These are in the retrieved graph facts, but no underlying document chunks were provided to cite.)\n\n### What this says about consumer behavior\n- **Bifurcation by income/segment:** The Manhattan retail market is explicitly described as split\u2014**luxury resilient; other segments weak**\u2014consistent with uneven consumer strength across segments. [DOC: e6eb1c74-7de8-41eb-807a-b9171cd6c90d, CHUNK: e6eb1c74-7de8-41eb-807a-b9171cd6c90d]\n- **Value-conscious behavior within services (restaurants):** The evidence set describes consumers still spending at restaurants but cutting back on \u201cdesserts and alcoholic beverages,\u201d implying **selective spending/trade-down within a category**. (Graph fact only; no citable chunk provided.)\n- **Rotation between goods and services:** The evidence set explicitly notes \u201cHousehold spending shifted between goods and services,\u201d aligning with goods softness and services resilience. (Graph fact only; no citable chunk provided.)\n- **Heightened price sensitivity (especially lower-income):** The evidence set says consumption became more volatile due to \u201cheightened price sensitivity,\u201d with low- and moderate-income households reducing spending and being more deal/selectivity oriented, while upper-income households continued spending on luxury/services. (Graph fact only; no citable chunks provided.)\n\n## Caveats\n- Although the question asks for **which retail categories** gained/declined, **most category-level points are only present as relationship-style graph facts without the underlying source text chunks** in the provided evidence package. Per the rules, I can *fully cite* only the Manhattan luxury-vs-other bifurcation statement.

      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is specifically about Chicago retail categories: gains in computers, appliances, personal services, and discount/value stores; declines in apparel and grocery, reflecting value-seeking while cutting back on essentials and discretionary items, with strong corridors for higher earners. The agent instead discusses restaurant spending, Manhattan luxury resilience, and declines in furniture/electronics/appliances/building materials plus travel softness\u2014largely unrelated to the Chicago-focused categories and even contradicting expected gains (appliances). It does not mention the key Chicago gain/decline categories (discount/value stores, personal services, apparel, grocery) and shifts geography to Manhattan/tourist destinations.",

      "answer": "## Direct Answer\nBased on the available evidence, I cannot comprehensively compare how energy sector performance varied across multiple Federal Reserve districts because only one district-specific source chunk (Eleventh District/Dallas Fed) is retrievable.

Therefore, I **cannot** cite them or use them to describe cross-district variation.  \n- As a result, the only district for which I can provide a sourced answer is the **Eleventh District**, and only for the staffing/efficiency dynamic described above.

      "expected": "In Dallas, price pressures were subdued in services but remained elevated in the manufacturing sector. In Richmond, price growth remained moderate overall despite some pickup in price growth in the manufacturing sector. In Chicago, producer prices grew moderately with contacts reporting moderate nonlabor cost increases including energy and raw materials. Manufacturing contacts attributed some raw materials price increases to tariffs, suggesting tariffs disproportionately affected goods-producing sectors.",
      "answer": "## Direct Answer\nAcross the cited Fed district reports, **manufacturing generally faced stronger or more variable price pressures than services/nonmanufacturing**\u2014including **slight increases or sharper rises in selling prices in manufacturing (often linked to tariffs)**\u2014while **services/nonmanufacturing price growth was described as flat/unchanged or holding steady**, though **some service firms expected price increases to accelerate over the next year**.

Manufacturing declined modestly (consistent with national challenging conditions). Employment flat (matching national stable levels). Wages up modestly (matching national modest-to-moderate). Prices rose moderately (matching national rising trend). Financial conditions loosened (better than mixed national picture). Construction/real estate increased slightly (better than mixed national). Farm income prospects unchanged. Compared to national trends, Chicago showed relative strength in consumer spending and financial conditions while manufacturing weakness aligned with broader challenges.",
