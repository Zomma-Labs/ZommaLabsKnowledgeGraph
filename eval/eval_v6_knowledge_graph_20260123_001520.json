      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected_answer": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "system_answer": "From the prior reporting period into mid‑August, economic activity in the Twelfth District (San Francisco) had been somewhat stronger than in the most recent period, but by **mid‑August to September 2025** it had begun to **edge down slightly**.\n\n**Prior to mid‑August 2025 (earlier reporting period)**\n- Conditions were relatively firmer than in the latest report: the description of mid‑August to September as a “modest softening from earlier conditions” implies that earlier in 2025, economic activity was at a slightly higher level. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Contacts’ outlook at that earlier time was **more optimistic** than it would be in the subsequent mid‑August–September period. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Mid‑August to September 2025**\n- **Overall activity**: Economic activity **edged down slightly**, representing a small but noticeable weakening compared with the earlier period. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Sectoral changes**:\n  - **Retail trade**: Activity **declined somewhat** over this period. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Agriculture**: Also **decreased somewhat**, contributing to the overall softening. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Residential real estate**: Activity **fell modestly**, indicating weaker housing demand or tighter conditions. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Commercial real estate**: Was **broadly unchanged**, showing no significant deterioration or improvement. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Manufacturing**: Remained **largely stable**, neither expanding nor contracting noticeably. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Lending**: Also **largely stable**, suggesting no major shift in credit availability or demand. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Consumer and business services**: Conditions were **mixed**, with some areas holding up and others softening. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Community support organizations and small businesses**: Reported **modest weakening**, indicating growing stress at the community and small‑firm level. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Labor market, wages, and prices**:\n  - **Employment**: Was **largely flat**, with most firms keeping headcounts steady rather than expanding or cutting significantly. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Wages**: **Rose slightly**, pointing to ongoing but moderate wage pressures. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Prices**: **Increased modestly**, indicating some continued inflationary pressure but not an acceleration. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Outlook as of mid‑August to September**: Contacts’ **economic outlook deteriorated somewhat** relative to the prior reporting period, reflecting a **slightly more pessimistic view of near‑term conditions** going forward from late September 2025. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nIn summary, compared with earlier 2025, the **mid‑August to September 2025** period in the Twelfth District saw a **gradual softening**: overall activity edged down, several key sectors (retail, agriculture, residential real estate) weakened, the labor market plateaued, and expectations for the near term turned more negative, even as wages and prices continued to rise modestly. [BeigeBook_20251015]",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Overall economic activity in the Twelfth District edged down slightly.\n2) Activity in retail trade either decreased or remained stable.\n3) Activity in agriculture either decreased or remained stable.\n4) Activity in residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer explicitly states that overall economic activity \"edged down slightly\" – matches (1).\n- It states retail trade activity \"declined somewhat\" – consistent with (2).\n- It states agriculture \"decreased somewhat\" – consistent with (3).\n- It states residential real estate activity \"fell modestly\" – consistent with (4).\n\nThe system adds more sectoral details (commercial real estate, manufacturing, lending, etc.) and time‑framing (mid‑August to September 2025), but none of these contradict the ground truth. These are additional details, not errors.\n\nThere are no factual contradictions with the expected answer and all key points are covered accurately. Thus the answer is complete and correct relative to the ground truth, just more detailed.\n",
