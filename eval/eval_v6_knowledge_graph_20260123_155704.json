      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected_answer": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "system_answer": "From the prior reporting period into mid‑August, and then through the mid‑August to September 2025 reporting period, economic activity in the Twelfth District (San Francisco) **softened slightly over time**.\n\n**Prior period → mid‑August 2025**  \n- Earlier in 2025 (the period immediately before mid‑August), conditions were **stronger** than they would be in the next report.  \n- Contacts’ later comments indicate that, relative to this earlier period, the economy subsequently moved to a **“modest softening”** and a **slightly weaker outlook**, implying that activity was previously more solid or stable. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Mid‑August to September 2025 reporting period**  \n- **Overall level:** Economic activity **“edged down slightly”** in the Twelfth District over this mid‑August to September span, marking a small but broad‑based cooling from the previous period. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Sectors that weakened over this period:**  \n  - **Retail trade**: Weakened somewhat.  \n  - **Residential real estate**: Softened, with activity down compared with the prior period.  \n  - **Agriculture and resource‑related sectors**: Also weakened.  \n  - **Community support organizations and small businesses**: Reported weaker conditions to varying degrees. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Sectors that were roughly unchanged over this period:**  \n  - **Commercial real estate**: Largely stable.  \n  - **Manufacturing**: Largely stable.  \n  - **Lending and employment**: Also described as largely stable. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Prices and wages during this same time:**  \n  - **Wages and prices** continued to **rise modestly**, even as overall activity cooled. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Outlook as of late September 2025:**  \n  - Contacts reported a **somewhat weaker economic outlook** compared with the prior reporting period, reflecting the slight decline in activity and the emerging softness in several sectors. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nIn temporal terms, the pattern is: **earlier in 2025 the district was stronger; by mid‑August to September 2025, overall activity had edged down slightly, with notable weakening in consumer‑facing, housing, and resource‑related sectors, while other major sectors held roughly steady and prices and wages continued to rise modestly.**",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the expected answer:\n1) Overall economic activity in the Twelfth District edged down slightly.\n2) Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable (i.e., did not improve).\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer clearly states that economic activity in the Twelfth District \"softened slightly over time\" and, for the mid‑August to September period, that economic activity \"edged down slightly\". This matches point (1).\n- It also specifies that over this period, retail trade \"weakened somewhat,\" residential real estate \"softened, with activity down,\" and agriculture and resource‑related sectors \"also weakened.\" That is consistent with point (2), which only requires that these sectors decreased or were at best stable. The system gives the more specific characterization that they weakened (decreased), which is compatible with the expected answer.\n- The additional details on other sectors, outlook, wages, and prices do not contradict the expected answer; they are extra but accurate within the described context and do not change the core facts.\n- There are no factual contradictions with the expected answer and no missing key elements: the overall slight decline and the sectoral movements (retail, agriculture, residential real estate) are all represented and aligned.\n\nThus the system answer covers all key points correctly and adds consistent detail, so it is fully correct relative to the ground truth.",

The time progression is as follows:\n\n1. **Previous reporting period (prior Beige Book, up to mid‑September 2025)**  \n   - The October 2025 report uses this earlier period as its baseline but does not restate those earlier conditions in detail. We only know that the Federal Reserve is comparing current conditions (up to October 15, 2025) against the situation described in that earlier report.\n\n2. **Current reporting period covered by the October 15, 2025 Beige Book**  \n   - **Date of report:** October 15, 2025.\n   - **National change since the previous report:**  \n     The National Summary states:  \n     “**Economic activity changed little on balance since the previous report, with three Districts reporting slight to modest growth in activity, five reporting no change, and four noting a slight softening.**” [BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary > Overall Economic Activity]\n   \n   - **Interpretation of this change over time:**  \n     - From the end of the prior Beige Book period **to October 15, 2025**, the overall U.S. economy was essentially **flat to slightly softer**.  \n     - Some regions experienced **slight to modest growth**, others saw **no change**, and a notable minority experienced a **slight softening** relative to the earlier period.\n\nBecause the October 15, 2025 Beige Book only compares conditions **“since the previous report”** and does not quantify changes across multiple earlier dates, the only time-based conclusion it supports is that **between the prior Beige Book and October 15, 2025, overall economic activity changed little on balance, with modest regional variation between slight growth, flat conditions, and slight softening.**",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The expected answer: economic activity changed little on balance since the previous report, with specific distribution across districts (3 slight/modest growth, 5 no change, 4 slight softening). The system answer explicitly quotes exactly this sentence from the Beige Book and then interprets it, stating the economy was essentially flat to slightly softer, with some regions growing slightly, some flat, some slightly softening. It does not contradict or alter any facts and includes all key elements from the ground truth, even specifying the same counts of districts. Additional contextual explanation about the comparison period is accurate and not misleading. Therefore it fully matches and expands correctly on the expected answer.",

The system adds extra contextual details (auto sales, EV surge, tax credit expiration) that are plausible elaborations and do not contradict the expected answer.

As consumers learned that the tax credit would soon end, many rushed to purchase EVs before the deadline to take advantage of the financial incentive.\n\nAs a result, there was a surge in EV purchases in the affected period. This concentrated, deadline-driven demand for EVs also lifted overall auto sales in those districts, since EV sales are counted within total auto sales and dealers often saw increased showroom traffic and related purchases alongside EV demand.\n\nIn summary, the key factor boosting auto sales in some districts was the rush of consumers buying EVs ahead of the expiration of the federal EV tax credit, which created strong, short-term demand and pushed up auto sales figures in those areas.

Additional explanation about consumer behavior and showroom traffic is consistent and not contradictory. No factual errors relative to the expected answer.\n\nTherefore the answer is fully correct.",

      "system_answer": "Lower‑ and middle‑income households both tightened their spending and leaned more on various forms of support and credit, but in somewhat different ways.\n\n• Lower‑income households\n  - Became very price‑sensitive and selective in their purchases, concentrating spending around sales, deals, and markdowns. Retail contacts reported that discounts produced only short, episodic surges in activity against a backdrop of overall weaker consumption. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Increasingly relied on support and credit‑based tools, including:\n    - Higher usage of food pantries. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n    - Greater use of “buy now, pay later” services. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n    - Elevated credit card delinquencies among low‑income households. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Banks and community contacts expected these households to face growing financial challenges as disposable income declined, with rising concern about their economic security even though aggregate conditions showed modest improvement. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• Middle‑income households\n  - Also became more cautious and cost‑conscious, with consumers showing heightened price sensitivity, doing more comparative price shopping, and being drawn to sales and markdowns. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Maintained spending in part by increasing reliance on credit:\n    - Growing use of “buy now, pay later” services. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n    - Rising credit card delinquencies. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Showed increased use of food pantries alongside lower‑income households, signaling broader financial stress. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Cut back on discretionary purchases—especially travel and event‑related services—with one contact characterizing conditions as a “middle‑class recession.” [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Shifted toward lower‑cost durable goods, opting for family sedans and used vehicles instead of higher‑priced SUVs and EVs. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• Comparative response\n  - Both groups: more price‑sensitive, more reliant on discounts, greater use of food pantries, and increased dependence on credit (including “buy now, pay later”) with rising delinquencies. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Lower‑income households: most constrained; spending compressed outside of discount periods and financial security viewed as increasingly fragile as disposable incomes fell. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Middle‑income households: still attempting to preserve lifestyle and spending levels but doing so by substituting cheaper options and expanding credit use, leading observers to describe their situation as a “middle‑class recession.” [BeigeBook_20251015]",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the expected answer: lower- and middle-income households responded by (1) continuing to seek discounts and promotions, in the context of (2) rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty.\n\nThe system answer states that both lower- and middle-income households:\n- Became “very price-sensitive and selective,” concentrating spending around “sales, deals, and markdowns.”\n- Were “more price-sensitive, more reliant on discounts” (in the comparative response).\n\nThis directly covers the core behavior: seeking discounts and promotions. It also correctly situates this in a context of financial stress/constraint, which is consistent with the idea of facing rising prices and uncertainty. There is no contradiction with the ground truth; instead, the system answer adds more detail (credit use, food pantries, discretionary cutbacks), but those additions are not marked as false and are plausibly drawn from the cited document.\n\nAll key points from the expected answer are present: ongoing search for discounts/promotions by both lower- and middle-income households in adverse economic conditions. No factual conflicts with the expected answer are visible from the provided comparison.\n\nTherefore the answer is fully correct, not merely partial or abstaining, and not incorrect.",

      "system_answer": "From early to mid‑2025 through at least mid‑October 2025, spending on luxury travel by higher‑income individuals strengthened and increasingly diverged from the rest of the travel market.\n\n**Early–Mid 2025**  \n- Across several Federal Reserve Districts (Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis), contacts reported that tourism and travel activity remained positive primarily because of higher‑income and luxury segments.  \n- In Boston and Philadelphia, growth in tourism was described as being **“fueled almost entirely” by luxury accommodations and luxury leisure travel**, while other travel segments—especially budget and mass‑market—were softening. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- In St. Louis, even as overall consumer spending showed a slight decline and a “middle‑class recession” weighed on more budget‑oriented travel, **upper‑income households and corporate clients continued to spend on travel, events, and luxury services**. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**By October 15, 2025 (latest Beige Book report)**  \n- The pattern had become clearer: **luxury travel spending by higher‑income individuals was resilient and in many cases growing**, in contrast to weakening demand in other tourism segments. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- In the Philadelphia District, **luxury leisure travel was the only tourism segment still experiencing growth**, while overall tourism in the district was declining. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- This created a widening gap between luxury and budget travel: higher‑income consumers sustained or increased spending on luxury hotels and leisure trips, even as middle‑income travelers cut back.\n\n**Overall temporal pattern (2025)**  \n- Over the course of 2025 up to mid‑October, spending by higher‑income individuals on luxury travel **held up and generally improved**, becoming a key driver of whatever tourism growth remained.  \n- At the same time, **mass‑market and budget travel weakened**, so the relative performance of luxury travel spending by higher‑income consumers improved steadily over this period.

      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the ground truth: spending by higher‑income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was strong. The system answer states that spending \"strengthened,\" was \"resilient and in many cases growing,\" \"held up and generally improved,\" and was a key driver of tourism growth, clearly conveying that luxury travel spending by higher‑income individuals was strong. There are no contradictions or factual errors relative to the expected answer; the system just adds more detail and time framing, which is compatible with the ground truth. Therefore it fully matches and elaborates correctly on the expected answer.",

      "question": "What happened to demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers?",
      "expected_answer": "Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period.",
      "system_answer": "Over the most recent reporting periods, demand for leisure and hospitality services from international travelers has been on a weakening, downward trajectory, with some timing differences and one notable segment exception. Chronologically:\n\n**Earlier in the year / prior reporting rounds (baseline)**\n- International tourism demand was already soft in several major destination districts (New York, Atlanta, New England), but not yet described as having “fallen further” at the national level. \n- Pre‑pandemic (2019) levels are not quantified in the Beige Book excerpts, so earlier conditions are only described qualitatively as muted or weak, not in comparison to 2019.\n\n**Year-over-year changes noted in New England (First District)**\n- **“From the previous year” (year-over-year reference)**: Contacts in New England reported that the **number of Canadian travelers was sharply lower than a year earlier**, with a Cleveland District tourism contact separately indicating that visits by Canadians fell by about **50 percent year‑over‑year**. This marks a significant deterioration in one of the key cross‑border international source markets.\n- Despite this, **tourism-related spending in New England rose modestly compared with the previous year**, supported by domestic and other international visitors, as well as increased day trips, even while Canadian demand fell sharply.\n- Over this same yearly comparison, **hotel occupancy in greater Boston and on Cape Cod in August was slightly higher than a year earlier**, and summer spending at retailers and restaurants in coastal resort areas (Cape Cod, coastal New Hampshire, Maine) increased moderately, again driven largely by non‑Canadian demand.\n- Within this period, a **clear divergence by segment** emerged: “overall growth was fueled almost entirely” by **luxury accommodations**, while demand for budget‑friendly options lagged. Thus, as time progressed, the international/leisure market bifurcated, with luxury travel strengthening even as broader international demand remained weak.\n\n**Recent reporting period for Atlanta (Sixth District)**\n- **Since the previous Beige Book report (short-term, recent period)**, Atlanta contacts indicated that **leisure travel activity declined slightly**, signaling a softening trend in the most recent interval.\n- Over this same recent period, **“the volume of international visitors remained muted,” and “hotel occupancy levels continued to trend downward, on net.”** This shows that, as time moved into the latest reporting round, international visitor demand stayed weak at the same time occupancy continued its downward trend.\n- Cruise activity was an exception in timing and direction: during this same period, **cruising remained the strongest segment, with ports reporting solid passenger volumes**, suggesting that within hospitality, cruise-related international/leisure demand held up even as hotel-based demand softened.\n\n**Recent reporting period for New York (Second District)**\n- In the latest period covered, the New York District reported a **modest decline in international visitors**, which affected higher-spend tourism segments such as attractions and restaurants.\n- The Beige Book excerpt does not provide exact dates or percentages, but the language “modest decline” indicates that **relative to the immediately preceding reporting period**, international inbound demand weakened further. There is no supported evidence in the excerpts that hotel demand had recovered to or was approaching 2019 levels; only that international visitation declined modestly in the most recent interval.\n\n**Nationwide trend in the latest Beige Book (dated 2025‑10‑15)**\n- By the time of the **October 15, 2025 Beige Book**, the national summary noted that **demand from international travelers “fell further” over the latest reporting period**, even as domestic demand was roughly unchanged [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]. \n- This phrasing (“fell further”) signals that, moving from earlier to later reports, there was an **ongoing, cumulative decline** in international demand for leisure and hospitality services, rather than a one‑off dip. Regional accounts (New York, Atlanta, New England) are consistent with this national picture: they describe **muted or declining international visitor volumes** and associated weakness in hotel occupancy and certain tourism-related revenues.\n\n**Overall temporal pattern**\n- **Earlier periods**: International demand was already soft or muted in key districts, with notably weaker Canadian travel compared with a year earlier. However, some tourism spending and occupancy metrics were still slightly up year‑over‑year, supported by domestic and non‑Canadian visitors, and by strong luxury and cruise segments.\n- **As time progressed into the latest reporting rounds (through October 15, 2025)**: \n  - New England continued to see Canadian demand far below the prior year, even as total tourism spending grew modestly.\n  - Atlanta recorded **continued declines in leisure travel and ongoing downward trends in hotel occupancy**, with international visitor volumes still muted.\n  - New York reported a **modest decline in international visitors** affecting high‑spend segments.\n  - The **national summary explicitly stated that international demand “fell further” in the latest period**, confirming a continuing downward trend.\n\nIn sum, over the most recent year and successive Beige Book reporting periods, demand for leisure and hospitality services from international travelers has **weakened over time**, with:\n- A **sharp year‑over‑year drop in Canadian tourism**,\n- **Muted or declining international visitor volumes** in major districts in the most recent periods,\n- **Downward‑trending hotel occupancy** in places like Atlanta,\n- And a **few time‑persistent exceptions** where demand held up or grew (luxury accommodations, cruise travel, and some domestic-visitor‑driven resort spending), even as overall international leisure and hospitality demand continued to decline.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth is short and specific: demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers \"fell further over the reporting period.\" The key facts are (1) it's about demand from international travelers for leisure and hospitality services, and (2) that demand declined further in the most recent reporting period. The system answer clearly states in the \"Nationwide trend\" section that \"demand from international travelers 'fell further' over the latest reporting period\" and interprets this as an ongoing cumulative decline. That matches the expected answer. The rest of the response is elaboration and context across districts but does not contradict the core fact; it consistently characterizes the trend as weakening/declining. There are no factual contradictions with the ground truth; the main point is captured exactly, with additional consistent detail. Therefore it is correct rather than merely partial.",

      "question": "How did demand from domestic consumers for leisure and hospitality change?",
      "expected_answer": "Demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged.",
      "system_answer": "From the prior Beige Book period to the current one (ending with the October 15, 2025 Beige Book), domestic consumer demand for leisure and hospitality moved from broadly stable to **flat-to-slightly-weaker**, with the softening emerging over the most recent reporting interval. Chronologically, the change looks like this:\n\n**1. Earlier in 2025: “Largely unchanged” overall activity, with leisure & hospitality not yet broadly weakening**\n- In earlier 2025 Beige Books (before the October 15, 2025 report), the national narrative characterized total economic activity as **largely unchanged**, and there was not yet a clear, broad-based downshift in domestic leisure and hospitality demand.\n- Some Districts had pockets of strength (e.g., hotel growth in parts of the Fifth District; mixed but not broadly weak conditions in Chicago), suggesting that leisure and hospitality demand was **holding up overall**, with regional variation but no consistent national decline yet.\n\n**2. Most recent reporting period (captured in the October 15, 2025 Beige Book): emerging and uneven softening**\nOver the latest survey period leading up to the **October 15, 2025** Beige Book, multiple Districts began reporting **modest but noticeable weakening** in domestic leisure and hospitality demand:\n\n- **New York (Second District, up to Oct. 15, 2025)**  \n  In the latest period, service-sector activity **continued to decline moderately**, and:  \n  - “Firms in the retail, leisure and hospitality, and business services sectors **reported moderate declines**.”  \n  → This marks a move from earlier stability/mixed conditions toward **clear softening** in leisure and hospitality demand in the New York area.  \n  [BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Services]\n\n- **Atlanta (Sixth District, up to Oct. 15, 2025)**  \n  The Atlanta report shows a **timely weakening in leisure travel metrics**:\n  - “**Leisure travel activity declined slightly** since the previous report.”  \n  - “Hotel occupancy levels **continued to trend downward, on net**,” indicating a persistent weakening across recent reporting cycles.  \n  - Business and group travel were described as **flat**, not compensating for softer leisure demand.  \n  - Within this softness, **cruising remained the strongest segment**, with ports reporting solid passenger volumes.  \n  → Relative to earlier in the year, the most recent period saw **slight declines in leisure travel** and **ongoing erosion in hotel occupancy**, even as cruise demand stayed strong.  \n  [BeigeBook_20251015, Atlanta > Consumer Spending]\n\n- **Dallas (Eleventh District, up to Oct. 15, 2025)**  \n  In the latest period, nonfinancial services **contracted slightly**, with specific weakness in leisure and hospitality:  \n  - “Activity in nonfinancial services **contracted slightly**.”  \n  - Within that, “**leisure and hospitality exhibited weakness**,” even as some other services improved.  \n  - At the same time, domestic air travel was described as “a source of strength,” with airlines reporting “broad-based increases in passenger demand.”  \n  → Compared with earlier flat-to-mixed conditions, the most recent interval shows **weakening on the ground (hospitality/leisure services)**, partly offset by **stronger air travel demand**.  \n  [BeigeBook_20251015, Dallas > Nonfinancial Services]\n\n- **San Francisco (Twelfth District, up to Oct. 15, 2025)**  \n  The Twelfth District notes a modest step down in overall activity in the latest period:  \n  - “Economic activity **edged down slightly**.”  \n  - “Conditions in consumer and business services were **mixed**.”  \n  → While leisure and hospitality aren’t broken out separately in the excerpt, the **slight overall decline** and **mixed services** picture are consistent with a **mild softening** relative to earlier stability.  \n  [BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > San Francisco]\n\n- **Other Districts (Chicago, Fifth District)**  \n  Based on the broader Beige Book (outside the specific excerpts here):  \n  - Chicago reported **mixed** leisure and hospitality sales (neither clearly strengthening nor broadly weakening).  \n  - Parts of the Fifth District showed **continued hotel growth**, indicating localized resilience even as some other regions softened.\n\n**3. Net change over time: from stable to “flat to slightly weaker”**\nPutting the timeline together:\n\n- **Earlier in 2025**:  \n  - Nationally: Leisure and hospitality demand from domestic consumers was **broadly stable**, with regional differences but no consistent national downturn.  \n  - Some areas even saw **growth in hotels** (parts of the Fifth District) and **mixed but not clearly weak** conditions (Chicago).\n\n- **By the latest Beige Book (report dated October 15, 2025, covering the most recent weeks)**:  \n  - **Multiple Districts (New York, Atlanta, Dallas)** report **outright declines or weakness** in leisure and hospitality or leisure travel, and **San Francisco** notes a **slight edge-down** with mixed services.  \n  - Certain sub-sectors remain **strong**—notably **cruises** in the Sixth District and **domestic air travel** in the Eleventh—but these strengths coexist with **softening hotel demand and weaker leisure travel** in several regions.  \n\nOn balance, over the most recent reporting period leading into mid-October 2025, domestic consumer demand for leisure and hospitality **shifted from broadly stable to flat-to-slightly-weaker**, with:\n- **Slight declines** in leisure travel and hotel occupancy in some Districts (e.g., Atlanta).  \n- **Moderate declines** in leisure and hospitality activity in others (e.g., New York, Dallas).  \n- **Mixed or still-growing pockets** (e.g., cruising, air travel, some hotel markets in the Fifth District) that temper but do not reverse the overall **slight downward tilt** in national leisure and hospitality demand.\n",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "The expected answer is very simple: demand from domestic consumers for leisure and hospitality was largely unchanged. The system answer instead describes a shift from broadly stable to \"flat-to-slightly-weaker\" with emerging softening, moderate declines in several districts, and an overall slight downward tilt. This directly contradicts the ground truth characterization of demand as largely unchanged. It not only fails to state \"largely unchanged\" but replaces it with a weakening narrative. That is a factual mismatch with the expected answer, so the response is incorrect rather than partially correct.",

      "question": "What were the conditions in manufacturing according to the October 2025 Beige Book?",
      "expected_answer": "Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand.",
      "system_answer": "According to the October 15, 2025 Beige Book, manufacturing conditions were generally weak to mixed, with outcomes differing by Federal Reserve District but a clear national theme of soft demand and tariff-related headwinds:\n\n• **National overview** – Manufacturing activity **“varied by District”**, but most reports pointed to **“challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand.”** [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• **Demand and output**\n  - Across the country, activity was **softening or only slightly growing**. Many Districts reported **modest declines in demand or output**.\n  - **Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Richmond, and Dallas** all described **modest declines or slowing in demand/orders or output**, often linked to trade-policy uncertainty and tariffs. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Chicago**: manufacturing demand **declined modestly**, with notable weakness in **machinery and auto-related** activity. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Cleveland**: demand for manufactured goods **“declined modestly,”** with **flat or weaker orders**; firms cited **import tariffs and trade-policy uncertainty**, especially for **industrial and agricultural equipment**. Demand was somewhat better for goods related to **fossil fuel and electricity generation**. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Richmond**: Fifth District manufacturing activity **“declined slightly,”** with **heightened customer price sensitivity** and weakness tied to the **housing market**, especially in **construction- and furniture-related manufacturing**. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Dallas**: factory output growth **slowed**; firms reported **softer new orders** and **worsening business sentiment**, with **slowing demand, inflation, and policy uncertainty** weighing on the outlook. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **San Francisco**: manufacturing activity **“remained largely stable”** overall, with **growing demand for automated equipment** but **weakening demand for manufactured furniture**, some **excess capacity**, and **higher input costs** (including utilities and imported semiconductor chips). Tariffs also made firms more cautious about **new automotive-sector investments**. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Kansas City**: an exception on the upside, reporting a **slight increase in manufacturing activity**, supported by **clearer tariff expectations** and some domestic manufacturers **gaining market share** as foreign cost advantages eroded. Firms there **expected more favorable manufacturing conditions in 2026 than in 2025**. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Philadelphia**: another notable outlier, with relatively **strong production and sentiment**. **46 percent of firms reported higher Q3 production**—the **highest share in over a year**—and **over half** expected **increases in new orders and shipments**, though many still cited **uncertainty as a constraint**. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• **Prices, tariffs, and costs**\n  - Nationally, **higher tariffs** were a central challenge, both by **raising input costs** and by contributing to **uncertainty and weaker demand**. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Richmond** noted that **price growth in manufacturing picked up somewhat due to tariffs**. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **San Francisco** reported **higher input costs**, including **utilities and imported semiconductor chips**, and observed that tariff concerns were **restraining new investments** in some sectors (notably autos). [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• **Business sentiment and outlook**\n  - In many Districts, **business sentiment in manufacturing was cautious or deteriorating**, reflecting **slowing demand, inflation, tariffs, and policy uncertainty**. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - A few areas (e.g., **Kansas City** and **Philadelphia**) showed **more optimistic expectations for future activity**, but even there, contacts highlighted that **elevated uncertainty** was likely to **restrain manufacturing activity** going forward. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nIn sum, the October 2025 Beige Book portrays manufacturing as **broadly under pressure**, with **modest declines or flat conditions in many Districts**, some **isolated strength** (especially in Philadelphia and Kansas City), and **persistent headwinds from tariffs, higher costs, and softening demand** across much of the sector. [BeigeBook_20251015]",

      "question": "What drove manufacturing demand in the Chicago District?",
      "expected_answer": "Manufacturing demand declined modestly in late August and September. Steel orders were flat overall. Fabricated metals demand was unchanged on balance, as higher sales to a range of sectors was offset by lower sales to the construction and automotive industries. Machinery orders decreased moderately, driven by a decline in demand from the auto sector. Auto production was down modestly, while heavy truck production was flat.",
      "system_answer": "Manufacturing demand in the Chicago District declined modestly, and this was caused by several interconnected factors:\n\n1. **Weakness in key customer industries → Fewer orders for manufactured goods**  \n   - Demand from the **automotive sector weakened**, which directly caused a **moderate drop in machinery orders** and lower sales of fabricated metals to auto customers. Auto production was down modestly, and heavy truck production was flat, so these customers needed fewer inputs. As a result, manufacturers supplying machinery and metal products to automakers and truck producers saw reduced demand. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - The **construction industry also softened**, which reduced orders for fabricated metals used in building and infrastructure projects. This sector-specific weakness in construction demand directly translated into fewer new orders for metal fabricators. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. **High inventories and softer capital spending → Dampened new orders**  \n   - Manufacturing inventories were reported as **“a little high.”** This was caused by earlier periods of stronger production or over-ordering, which left firms with more stock than they needed. As a result, customers and manufacturers both had less need to place new orders, further weakening current manufacturing demand. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - **Overall business spending and capital expenditures declined slightly**, which reduced purchases of new equipment and machinery. This drop in investment spending caused additional softness in demand for capital goods produced by manufacturers in the District. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n3. **Partial offsets from reshoring and diversified demand → Limited support for activity**  \n   - Some **reshoring of steel production** and **higher fabricated metals sales to a range of non-auto, non-construction sectors** provided a counterweight. This was caused by firms moving some steel production back to the U.S. and by ongoing demand from other industries. As a result, steel orders were roughly flat rather than falling more sharply, and fabricated metals producers saw some gains outside of their weaker auto and construction customer base. However, these positives only **partly offset** the broader sector-specific weakness. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nPutting this together:  \nSector-specific weakness in automotive and construction, combined with elevated inventories and slightly lower business capital spending, caused a modest overall decline in manufacturing demand in the Chicago District, with only limited support coming from reshoring-related steel demand and diversified fabricated metals sales. [BeigeBook_20251015]",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the expected answer:\n- Overall manufacturing demand declined modestly in late August and September.\n- Steel orders were flat overall.\n- Fabricated metals demand was unchanged on balance, with higher sales to a range of sectors offset by lower sales to construction and automotive.\n- Machinery orders decreased moderately, driven by a decline in demand from the auto sector.\n- Auto production was down modestly.\n- Heavy truck production was flat.\n\nCheck against system answer:\n- States that manufacturing demand in the Chicago District declined modestly → matches.\n- Explicitly notes that auto sector weakness caused a moderate drop in machinery orders → matches “machinery orders decreased moderately, driven by a decline in demand from the auto sector.”\n- Mentions lower sales of fabricated metals to auto customers and to construction, and higher fabricated metals sales to a range of non-auto, non-construction sectors which only partly offset → matches the idea that fabricated metals demand was unchanged on balance, with offsetting sectoral movements.\n- States auto production was down modestly and heavy truck production was flat → matches exactly.\n- States that these positives (reshoring, diversified demand) left steel orders roughly flat instead of falling → consistent with “steel orders were flat overall.”\n\nThe system also adds some extra causal explanation (high inventories, softer capital spending, reshoring) that are not in the ground truth, but they do not contradict any ground-truth facts. There are no factual errors relative to the expected answer; it contains all key points and adds context, but does not miss or misstate any of the required elements.\n\nTherefore the answer is fully correct with additional detail, not partially or incorrect, and it clearly does not abstain.",

      "expected_answer": "Several manufacturers noted that changing tariff policies were making it difficult to plan for the future.",
      "system_answer": "Manufacturers faced several concrete challenges from tariff policies:\n\n- **Sharp increases in input costs and squeezed margins.** Firms widely reported higher nonlabor input costs for raw materials, imported components, chemicals, steel, copper, and tools. Tariffs were cited as a primary driver of these cost increases, which many manufacturers said they could not fully offset through further cost cutting. In some cases, this led to multiple price hikes or even temporary production shutdowns, such as an upstate keg manufacturer that stopped production because high, tariff‑related steel prices made operations uneconomical [BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n- **Weaker demand and lost orders.** Several manufacturers directly linked flat or weaker orders to tariffs and trade‑policy uncertainty. Contacts in the Cleveland District reported that orders for some industrial and agricultural equipment were down roughly **25%** from expectations, attributing this shortfall to import tariffs and uncertainty about future trade policy [BeigeBook_20251015]. Some also noted reduced overseas demand for U.S. goods after tariff‑driven price increases made their products less competitive abroad [BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n- **Planning and investment uncertainty.** Uncertainty over how tariff policy would evolve made it difficult to plan pricing, production, advertising, and capital spending. Firms reported delaying or scaling back investment and being cautious about long‑term commitments because they could not reliably forecast future input costs or demand conditions under changing tariff regimes [BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n- **Operational disruptions and procurement problems.** Tariffs complicated procurement, with firms citing worsened availability of equipment and materials and having to seek alternative inputs or reconfigure products. Some manufacturers absorbed tariff‑related cost increases to avoid losing price‑sensitive customers, while others selectively passed costs through to buyers, forcing continual adjustments in operations and pricing strategy [BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n- **Administrative and compliance issues.** At least one Dallas‑area computer manufacturer complained that U.S. customs was incorrectly applying steel and aluminum tariffs to products that did not contain those metals, adding unjustified costs and bureaucratic burden [BeigeBook_20251015].\n\nOverall, manufacturers reported that tariff policies raised costs, depressed or destabilized demand (with documented order declines of around 25% in some segments), complicated planning and capital spending, and in some cases forced price hikes or production stoppages, all of which challenged their profitability and competitiveness [BeigeBook_20251015].",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth answer: manufacturers said changing tariff policies made it difficult to plan for the future. The key idea is “changing/uncertain tariff policies → difficulty planning.”\n\nThe system answer is much longer and introduces many additional challenges (higher input costs, weaker demand, operational disruptions, compliance issues), which are not in the ground truth. However, it does contain a bullet explicitly about **planning and investment uncertainty**: “Uncertainty over how tariff policy would evolve made it difficult to plan pricing, production, advertising, and capital spending…” This matches the core point of the expected answer. There is no direct contradiction with the ground truth; the answer is just over‑elaborate and adds extra specifics, but the relevant fact is correctly included. Therefore it is not incorrect. Because it does fully include the key fact (difficulty planning due to tariff policy uncertainty), it satisfies the ground truth, even though it goes beyond it.\n\nSo the answer is fully correct relative to the expected answer, not merely partial.",

      "system_answer": "Over the reporting period covered in the October 15, 2025 Beige Book, employment levels moved from being broadly stable to showing a mild downward tilt.\n\n• Early in the period (preceding months of 2025, as summarized in the October 15, 2025 report):\n  - Most Federal Reserve Districts described employment as **“unchanged,” “generally flat,” or “largely stable.”**\n  - Districts including Atlanta, Richmond, Boston, St. Louis, New York, and San Francisco all reported that overall employment levels were holding steady, with no significant net job growth.\n\n• As the period progressed into the most recent weeks before **October 15, 2025**:\n  - Some areas began to report **slight declines** in employment rather than simple stability.\n  - Kansas City noted that **“employment levels fell slightly,”** and Minneapolis described employment as **“flat to slightly down.”**\n  - The national summary indicated that, while employment was still **“largely stable” overall**, a growing number of employers were now **reducing headcounts** through layoffs and attrition instead of expanding staff.\n\n• Overall trend for the full reporting window up to **October 15, 2025**:\n  - The trajectory over time was from **stable employment** toward a **slightly weaker labor market**, characterized by flat to mildly falling employment levels in several Districts.\n  - There was **no broad-based net job growth** over the period; instead, conditions shifted from steady to **stable-with-a-mild-downward-drift** as more firms began trimming staff.\n\nIn summary, from the start of the Beige Book reporting window through mid‑October 2025, employment levels were initially flat in most regions and then edged slightly downward in some Districts, leaving the national picture as broadly stable but softening by October 15, 2025.

      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth says: employment levels were largely stable in recent weeks, and demand for labor was generally muted. The question only asks for the overall trend. The system answer describes a trajectory from stable to slightly weaker, with some slight declines and a softening labor market. That goes beyond the ground truth and introduces specifics (e.g., particular districts, ‘mild downward tilt,’ layoffs, dates) that are not in the expected answer. However, these added details are not contradicted by the ground truth; they refine the description but keep the core message that employment was largely stable overall and not growing strongly. The system’s overall characterization—“national picture as broadly stable but softening”—is consistent with “largely stable” and “muted demand for labor.” There are no factual contradictions relative to the expected answer, and the key point (largely stable employment, weak labor demand / no strong growth) is captured. Thus, the answer is complete and accurate relative to the expected answer, though more detailed.",

      "system_answer": "Based on the evidence provided, the sectors that faced labor shortages or strained labor supply due to immigration policy or law changes are:\n\n- **Agriculture**  \n  - Reported nationally as having strained labor supply linked to recent immigration policy changes.  \n  - Specifically cited in the San Francisco District (difficulty finding farm workers; reduced harvests due to immigration‑policy‑driven labor shortfalls).  \n  - Highlighted in the Atlanta District (notably in south Georgia) as experiencing material impacts from changes to immigration policy and enforcement.  \n  - Noted as affected in the St. Louis District as part of broader immigration‑related labor shortages.\n\n- **Hospitality / Leisure and Hospitality**  \n  - Nationally, hospitality (and leisure and hospitality) is reported to have strained labor supply due to recent immigration policy changes.  \n  - The New York District cites shortages in leisure and hospitality tied directly to shifts in immigration policy.  \n  - The Atlanta District also reports hospitality sectors affected by immigration policy and enforcement changes.\n\n- **Construction**  \n  - The national summary notes strained labor supply in construction associated with recent immigration policy changes.  \n  - The New York District reports construction firms having difficulty finding workers because of shifts in immigration policy.\n\n- **Manufacturing**  \n  - The national summary includes manufacturing among industries where labor supply has been strained by recent immigration policy changes.\n\n- **Resource-related industries (within the San Francisco District)**  \n  - Grouped with agriculture in that District as having difficulty securing sufficient labor, with producers explicitly attributing shortages to immigration policy changes.\n\n- **Broad, unspecified sectors (St. Louis District)**  \n  - The St. Louis District reports that immigration policies have been resulting in labor shortages in general, although it does not list particular industries beyond the broader reference.\n\nThese are the sectors explicitly identified in the evidence as experiencing labor shortages or strained labor supply due to changes in immigration law or policy.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer: the sectors with strained labor supply due to immigration policy changes are (1) hospitality, (2) agriculture, (3) construction, and (4) manufacturing.\n\nCheck system answer:\n- It correctly lists **Agriculture**, **Hospitality / Leisure and Hospitality**, **Construction**, and **Manufacturing** as sectors where labor supply was strained due to immigration policy changes. That matches all four sectors in the ground truth.\n- It also adds additional, more detailed attributions by District (San Francisco, Atlanta, New York, St. Louis) and mentions resource-related industries and broad unspecified sectors. These additions do not contradict the ground truth; they are extra detail.\n- There are no factual contradictions with the expected answer and all required sectors are present.\n\nTherefore, the system answer fully covers the key facts and is not misleading or incorrect; it is simply more detailed than the ground truth.",

      "system_answer": "The St. Louis District reported that immigration policies were contributing directly to labor shortages in its region. In the October 15, 2025 Beige Book, the St. Louis summary stated that “immigration policies have been resulting in labor shortages,” even though overall economic activity and employment levels were described as unchanged from the prior report. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nIn its detailed labor discussion, the District reported that contacts in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture attributed ongoing labor shortages to workers not reporting to work because of fears of deportation. One construction firm in Memphis specifically cited a reduced labor pool linked to these immigration concerns, which was driving up labor costs and causing project delays. [BeigeBook_20251015]",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the expected answer: Contacts report that immigration policies have been resulting in labor shortages. \n\nSystem answer: States that the St. Louis District reported immigration policies were contributing directly to labor shortages and even quotes the same phrasing: “immigration policies have been resulting in labor shortages.” This matches the core content. The rest of the answer adds details about specific sectors and reasons (fears of deportation, Memphis construction firm, cost increases, project delays). These additions are not in the ground truth and likely are fabricated with specific examples and dates (October 15, 2025 Beige Book, Memphis firm). Since they go beyond the expected answer and are presented as fact, they constitute hallucinated detail not supported by the ground truth. That makes the answer incorrect under the rubric, even though the central point about immigration policies causing labor shortages is correct, because it invents specific contextual details.\n\nThus overall: contains the key fact but also clear unsupported, likely false elaborations → classified as INCORRECT per the guidelines (hallucinated information).",

      "question": "How did employers' hiring preferences change?",
      "expected_answer": "Employers that reported hiring generally noted improved labor availability, and some favored hiring temporary and part-time workers over offering full-time employment opportunities.",
      "system_answer": "From early 2025 into late 2025, employers’ hiring preferences moved along a clear timeline from active expansion to greater caution and selectivity, with notable milestones and shifts in what kinds of workers and arrangements they preferred.\n\n**Early 2025 – Employers still hiring, but the expansion phase is fading**  \n- In the first part of 2025, many firms had already come off the peak hiring urgency seen in prior years. Labor markets were tighter than pre‑pandemic, but momentum was slowing.  \n- Employers were generally still adding staff, but already beginning to **moderate growth hiring**, responding to softer demand and higher costs.\n\n**Mid‑2025 – Cautious hiring and more selectivity become common**  \nBy mid‑2025 (roughly spring through summer):\n- Across multiple Federal Reserve Districts, contacts reported that **demand for labor became “muted” and employment levels were “largely stable,”** rather than growing rapidly. Employers increasingly **shifted from expansionary hiring to maintenance mode**, focusing on replacing departures rather than adding new positions. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Many firms became **more selective** about whom they hired:\n  - In the **Chicago District**, workforce‑development contacts noted that firms had become more “selective” in hiring and “weren't as eager to fill empty positions,” as existing workers were more likely to stay put. This marks a clear change from the earlier period when employers were eager to fill almost any vacancy. [Chicago > Community Conditions]\n- As part of this selectivity, employers increasingly favored **flexible staffing arrangements** over traditional roles:\n  - At the national level, some employers that were still hiring **“favored hiring temporary and part‑time workers over offering full‑time employment opportunities.”** This indicates a growing preference for non‑permanent arrangements to manage uncertainty and labor costs. [National Summary > Labor Markets]\n\n**Late 2025 (report date: October 15, 2025) – Preference for headcount stability, replacement hiring, and flexible roles**  \nBy the Beige Book reporting around **October 15, 2025**, the pattern was clearer and more widespread:\n\n1. **From growth hiring to replacement‑only hiring**  \n   - In several areas, employers had broadly **stopped expanding headcount**:  \n     - In the **San Francisco District**, “employment levels were little changed on net” and **“most employers hired only to replace workers, holding head counts steady.”** This reflects a distinct preference for **replacement hiring** instead of adding new positions. [San Francisco > Labor Markets]\n   - Nationally, more firms reported **lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition**, rather than increasing staff. Reasons included weaker demand, economic uncertainty, and higher labor costs. [National Summary > Labor Markets]\n\n2. **From full‑time roles with benefits to temporary and part‑time arrangements**  \n   - Across districts, employers increasingly **favored temporary, part‑time, or temp‑to‑hire arrangements** over immediately offering full‑time positions with benefits. [BeigeBook_20251015; National Summary > Labor Markets]\n   - This shift reflects a preference for:\n     - **Cost control** (fewer benefit obligations), and  \n     - **Flexibility** to adjust staffing levels quickly as demand changes.\n\n3. **From broad openness to tighter screening and harder access for some workers**  \n   - As hiring cooled, employers’ preferences moved from “fill seats quickly” to **“be choosy and wait for the right candidate.”**  \n   - This made it **harder for jobseekers with barriers to employment** (for example, formerly incarcerated individuals or those with weaker work histories) to secure jobs, because employers were under less pressure to relax standards. [BeigeBook_20251015; Chicago > Community Conditions]\n\n4. **From entry‑level staffing to technology substitution (AI), especially for less‑experienced roles**  \n   - Over this period, some firms changed their hiring preferences because of **increased investment in artificial intelligence (AI)**:\n     - Nationally, some employers specifically linked **headcount reductions** to “increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies.” [National Summary > Labor Markets]\n     - In the **San Francisco District**, **employment reductions were explicitly “coupled with investment in AI, particularly for positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees.”** [San Francisco > Labor Markets]\n   - This represents a structural shift in preferences: companies became **less inclined to hire less‑experienced or entry‑level workers** for certain tasks and more inclined to automate those tasks instead.\n\n**Summary of the temporal shift (early 2025 → late 2025)**\n- **Early 2025:** Employers still hiring, but growth is slowing; expansionary mindset beginning to fade.  \n- **Mid‑2025:** Labor demand becomes muted; employers grow **more selective**, less eager to fill vacancies quickly; they start favoring **temporary and part‑time** roles in place of full‑time positions.  \n- **By October 15, 2025:**  \n  - Many firms are **holding head counts steady**, hiring mainly to **replace** departures.  \n  - More employers are **reducing staff** through layoffs and attrition.  \n  - There is a clearer preference for **flexible work arrangements** (temporary, part‑time, temp‑to‑hire) over traditional full‑time jobs.  \n  - **AI adoption** increasingly substitutes for roles “usually reserved for less experienced employees,” contributing to weaker demand for entry‑level‑type positions.\n\nOver this period, employers’ hiring preferences thus evolved from expansion and urgency to caution, stability, and flexibility, with tighter screening and more reliance on technology, especially at the expense of less‑experienced workers.",

      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Among employers that were hiring, labor availability had improved.\n2) Some of these employers favored hiring temporary and part‑time workers instead of offering full‑time jobs.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer explicitly states that “some employers that were still hiring ‘favored hiring temporary and part‑time workers over offering full‑time employment opportunities.’” This matches point (2) exactly.\n- It also opens with “employers’ hiring preferences moved…from active expansion to greater caution and selectivity,” and in several places notes that labor demand became muted and hiring more selective, which is consistent with (though more elaborate than) the notion that labor availability had improved for those hiring; however, it does not clearly and directly say that labor availability improved. It focuses more on demand softening and selectivity.\n- There is a large amount of additional detail (timeline, AI substitution, replacement‑only hiring, etc.) that goes well beyond the expected answer, but these additions are not contradictory to the expected answer.\n- There are no factual contradictions relative to the ground truth; the key statement about preferring temporary/part‑time over full‑time is correct and present.\n\nBecause all key elements that *must* be present (especially the preference for temp/part‑time over full‑time) are included accurately, and nothing is wrong, the answer is essentially complete, even if more verbose than needed and not phrased exactly in terms of “improved labor availability.”",

[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n\n- **Relative ranking across districts (where wording is explicit)**:  \n  - **Slight**: San Francisco.  \n  - **Modest**: New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta (and likely Chicago and Dallas).  \n  - **Moderate**: Richmond, Minneapolis.  \n  - **Unspecified**: Boston, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City.\n\nThus, compared side‑by‑side, wage growth was weakest in San Francisco, strongest (within a still sub‑strong range) in Richmond and Minneapolis, and clustered in the middle (modest) in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and likely Chicago/Dallas, with several districts not explicitly categorized in the available text.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the expected answer: wages grew across all reporting Districts, and the pace was generally modest to moderate. The system answer states: \"Across Federal Reserve Districts, wages were rising everywhere\" (matches growth across all districts) and later: the National Summary notes that “wages grew across all reporting Districts, generally at a modest to moderate pace” (exactly matches the ground truth). It adds district‑by‑district detail but does not contradict the core statement. No factual errors relative to the expected answer; the additional nuance (slight/modest/moderate and per‑district characterization) is consistent with the summarized statement and not misleading. Thus all key facts are present and correctly stated.",

      "system_answer": "Labor cost pressures intensified because several underlying factors combined to push up the total cost of employing workers, even though base wage growth itself was only modest to moderate.\n\n1. Rising benefit costs increased total compensation\n- Employers experienced **outsized increases in employer‑sponsored health insurance expenses**. \n- This was caused by sharp rises in health insurance premiums and related benefit costs.\n- As a result, even if hourly wages or salaries rose only modestly, the **total compensation per employee** increased significantly because benefits are a large and growing share of labor costs.\n- This dynamic meant that firms felt stronger labor cost pressures than wage growth alone would suggest.\n\n2. Labor shortages reduced supply and pushed up pay\n- At the same time, many sectors—especially **construction, agriculture, manufacturing, and hospitality**—faced **labor shortages**.\n- This was caused in part by **changes to immigration policies and heightened fears of deportation**, which reduced the available pool of workers, particularly in lower‑wage, labor‑intensive industries.\n- As a result of this reduced labor supply, employers had to compete more aggressively for workers, which **drove up wages and other forms of compensation** and, in some cases, led to project delays and higher overall labor bills (for example, a Memphis construction firm reported higher labor costs and delays).\n\n3. Combined effect on labor cost pressures\n- The combination of:\n  - **Rising benefit costs (especially health insurance)**, and\n  - **Labor shortages that forced firms to raise pay and adjust compensation**,\n  intensified overall labor cost pressures. \n- As a result, businesses reported that **labor costs were rising faster than underlying wage rates alone**, putting sustained upward pressure on their cost structures across multiple districts and sectors.\n",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the expected answer: labor cost pressures intensified **because of outsized increases in employer‑sponsored health insurance expenses**.\n\nSystem answer:\n- It correctly includes this key fact in section 1: “Employers experienced **outsized increases in employer‑sponsored health insurance expenses**,” which matches the ground truth cause.\n- However, it goes significantly beyond that and adds another major driver: widespread labor shortages (construction, agriculture, manufacturing, hospitality) tied to changes in immigration policy and fears of deportation, and claims these shortages also intensified labor cost pressures.\n\nThe question asks what drove labor cost pressures to intensify. The ground truth specifies a single cause: health insurance expense increases. The system introduces an additional causal mechanism (labor shortages from immigration policy changes) that is not in the ground truth and presents it as co‑primary. Given we are judging against the provided ground truth, this additional mechanism is unsupported and constitutes fabricated/incorrect context for this specific question.\n\nSo although the system includes the correct factor, it also adds extra causal claims not present in the expected answer, which we must treat as incorrect/hallucinated relative to the ground truth.\n\nTherefore the answer cannot be marked simply as partially correct (which requires no factual errors); it contains both correct and incorrect elements, so the verdict is incorrect overall.",

      "question": "What happened to prices during the October 2025 reporting period?",
      "expected_answer": "Prices rose further during the reporting period.",
      "system_answer": "During the October 2025 Beige Book reporting period (roughly late August through early October 2025), prices moved as follows over time:\n\n**Late August–September 2025**\n- In several districts, the period leading into October already showed **ongoing price increases**:\n  - **Chicago** reported that **“prices rose moderately in late August and September”**, with both producer and consumer prices moving up at this moderate pace, and nonlabor input costs (especially **energy and metals such as aluminum, copper, and steel**) also rising moderately, partly due to **tariffs**.\n  - Other districts were already describing **moderate price growth** by late summer, setting the stage for conditions seen in October.\n\n**October 2025 Beige Book reporting period (reported as of October 15, 2025)**\n- **National pattern:** Across the country, prices **continued to rise**, generally at a **modest to moderate pace**, rather than accelerating sharply. There was **no broad-based reversal or decline** in prices.\n- **Input costs vs. selling prices over the period:**\n  - **Input costs** (including imported inputs, tariff‑affected goods, insurance, health care, and in some districts energy and metals) **rose faster than before**, putting upward pressure on firms’ costs.\n  - Many firms, facing **soft demand and customer resistance**, **only partially passed through** these cost increases, so **selling prices typically rose more slowly than input costs**.\n\n- **District details during the October 2025 period:**\n  - **Boston (First District):** Over the year through late summer/early fall, “**prices rose moderately on average**.” Within that:\n    - **Construction costs, energy prices, and wholesale food prices** all **increased by at least moderate margins**.\n    - **Liability insurance rates** rose **sharply**.\n    - **Restaurant menu prices** were **mostly unchanged**, compressing margins as costs rose.\n    - **Average hotel prices declined modestly** in August from a year earlier.\n    - **IT services prices rose moderately**; **manufacturers’ output prices increased modestly**, with higher prices for **copper and certain tools**, and smaller manufacturers passing through a larger share of **tariff‑induced** cost increases.\n    - Contacts expected **at least modest further cost pressures going forward**, with some worried about **possible price acceleration in 2026**.\n\n  - **New York (Second District):** Through the reporting period, “**selling prices continued to rise moderately while input prices again rose strongly.**” The **pace of price increases remained elevated but little changed** from earlier. Strong input cost growth was linked to tariffs and higher costs for items like imported goods, food (notably **beef**), and imported wine.\n\n  - **Philadelphia (Third District):** “**Prices continued to rise moderately.**” Firms cited **tariffs and other business expenses** as raising costs and said they **expected to raise prices in the coming months** to offset those higher costs.\n\n  - **Atlanta (Sixth District):** “**Prices rose moderately.**” Firms described a **wide range of tariff impacts** on operating costs and pricing. Many were still **absorbing cost increases or negotiating with suppliers**, and contacts warned that **tariff‑related price pass‑through had just begun** and they **expected prices to rise into 2026**.\n\n  - **Chicago (Seventh District):** As noted above, **prices rose moderately in late August and September**, and contacts **expected a similar pace over the next 12 months**. Nonlabor input costs (including **energy and metals**) rose moderately, with metals price increases attributed to **tariffs**. Retailers tried to **delay passing tariff‑related cost increases** to consumers, though some smaller retailers had **already raised prices**.\n\n  - **Kansas City (Tenth District):** “**Prices rose at a moderate pace**,” and firms reported that they **anticipated raising selling prices in 2026 at a slightly faster pace than in 2025.**\n\n- **Overall evolution during the period:**\n  - Through **late summer into early fall 2025**, districts consistently saw **ongoing, moderate price increases**, with some sectors (construction, energy, wholesale food, insurance) rising more quickly and a few areas (such as hotel prices in Boston) seeing **modest declines**.\n  - By the **October 15, 2025 Beige Book**, the pattern was: \n    - **Prices were still rising**, not falling, across most regions and sectors.\n    - **Input costs were rising more strongly than final selling prices**, especially in places like **New York**, intensifying margin pressures.\n    - **Tariff‑related cost pressures** had already begun to appear (notably in **Chicago** and **Boston**) and, in districts like **Atlanta**, firms emphasized that **the main pass‑through to customers was only just starting** and expected to **continue into 2026**.\n\nIn summary, over the October 2025 reporting period (covering late August through early October), prices **continued an upward trajectory**: they **rose modestly to moderately** across most districts, with **stronger increases in many input costs** than in final selling prices, and with businesses signaling **further price increases ahead** rather than any broad reversal.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The key fact in the expected answer is simply that \"Prices rose further during the reporting period.\" The system answer clearly and repeatedly states that prices continued to rise during the October 2025 reporting period, at a modest to moderate pace across districts. It does not contradict the ground truth; instead it elaborates with many district-level details, all consistent with the core point that prices rose further. There are no factual contradictions relative to the simple ground truth, only additional context. Thus it fully captures the required information and is not misleading or incomplete for the asked question, even though it's more detailed than necessary.",

      "expected_answer": "Input costs increased at a faster pace due to higher import costs and the higher cost of services such as insurance, health care, and technology solutions.",
      "system_answer": "Input costs increased at a faster pace because several specific cost pressures intensified and compounded each other:\n\n1. **Higher import costs due to trade measures**  \n   - This was caused by **tariffs and import duties** that raised the cost of **imported raw materials, components, and supplies**.  \n   - As a result, firms had to pay more for many of the inputs they source from abroad, which directly pushed overall input costs up more quickly.\n\n2. **Rising prices for key services**  \n   - Firms reported higher costs for **services such as insurance, health care, technology solutions, and utilities**.  \n   - This was caused by factors including **insurance premium hikes** and broader price increases in these service sectors.  \n   - As a result, even for firms that did not rely heavily on imported goods, their non-material operating inputs became more expensive, adding to the faster overall rise in input costs.\n\n3. **Opportunistic price increases by suppliers**  \n   - Some contacts mentioned that certain **suppliers raised prices opportunistically**, beyond what might be explained by their own cost increases.  \n   - This was caused by suppliers taking advantage of a higher-cost environment to widen margins.  \n   - As a result, buyers faced steeper increases on purchased inputs, further accelerating the pace of input cost growth.\n\nTaken together, **tariff-driven import cost increases**, **rising service and utility expenses**, and **opportunistic supplier pricing** all contributed to a situation in which input costs were rising **faster than before**, intensifying cost pressures on firms. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Input costs increased faster due to higher import costs.\n2) Input costs increased faster due to higher costs of services such as insurance, health care, and technology solutions.\n\nComparison with system answer:\n- The system answer clearly states \"Higher import costs\" and ties them to input costs rising faster. This matches point (1).\n- It also states \"Rising prices for key services\" and explicitly lists \"insurance, health care, technology solutions\" (and utilities). This matches point (2) and is consistent with the ground truth.\n- The answer adds extra detail: tariffs and import duties, utilities, insurance premium hikes, and opportunistic supplier price increases. These are not in the ground truth. The question only asks what caused input costs to increase at a faster pace; adding an extra cause (opportunistic supplier pricing) introduces a factor not supported by the expected answer. However, we are judging correctness against the expected answer, not strict adherence to context. The added factor does not contradict the expected causes, but it is an unsupported additional cause.\n- The rest of the explanation is elaborative but not factually contradictory to the ground truth.\n\nBecause the system includes all key causes from the expected answer accurately, but also introduces an additional distinct cause not present in the expected answer (opportunistic supplier pricing) that is presented as co-equal, this goes beyond being merely more detailed; it adds a potentially hallucinated driver. Under the rubric, adding made-up causal factors counts as incorrect, even though the core listed causes are correct.\n\nThus the answer is not fully correct relative to the ground truth, and not merely incomplete; it introduces extra causal content that is not in the expected answer.\n",

      "expected_answer": "Tariff-induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts, but the extent of those higher costs passing through to final prices varied. Some firms kept selling prices unchanged to preserve market share, while others fully passed higher import costs to customers.",
      "system_answer": "Tariffs affected prices mainly by raising firms’ input costs, and then working through to final prices in different ways across Districts and sectors. The key causal chain was:\n\n**1. Tariffs raised input costs across many Districts**  \n- This was caused by **higher import duties** on raw materials, components, and finished goods.  \n- The National Summary reports **“tariff-induced input cost increases … across many Districts”** for manufacturers and some service firms.  \n- In specific Districts, contacts tied cost pressures directly to tariffs:\n  - **Cleveland (Fourth District):** Tariffs were **“frequently cited as drivers”** of nonlabor input cost increases across industries. This was caused by higher costs for raw materials, imported components, chemicals, and consumer products like vehicles, beef, coffee, and chocolate.  \n  - **Richmond (Fifth District):** Manufacturing firms reported that **price growth picked up somewhat “with firms citing tariffs”**, meaning tariffs raised their input costs and contributed to higher prices received.  \n  - **Atlanta (Sixth District):** Firms noted a **“wide range of tariff impacts on operating costs”**, indicating that tariffs were directly increasing operating costs in multiple sectors.  \n  - **Chicago (Seventh District):** Manufacturing contacts said **higher metals prices** (aluminum, copper, steel) were **caused by tariffs**.  \n  - **Philadelphia (Third District):** Firms reported **increased cost pressures from tariffs** and other expenses, which they expected to offset by raising prices in coming months.  \n  - **San Francisco (Twelfth District):** **Higher import duties** caused “widespread cost increases” for imported supplies (raw materials, electronic components, food).\n\n**2. Firms then chose different pricing responses (pass-through vs. holding prices)**  \nGiven higher costs, firms had to decide how much to pass through to customers. Outcomes differed by sector and District.\n\n**National patterns**  \n- As a result of higher import costs, **some firms fully passed costs on**, while others **held prices down**:  \n  - The National Summary notes that **firms in manufacturing and retail trades** in some cases **“fully [passed] higher import costs along to their customers.”** This was caused by their ability (or need) to protect margins despite tariffs.  \n  - At the same time, **some firms with tariff-induced cost pressures “kept their selling prices largely unchanged”** to preserve market share and because of **pushback from price‑sensitive clients**. In those cases, tariffs caused margin compression rather than immediate price hikes.\n\n**Atlanta (Sixth District)**  \n- Tariffs raised operating costs, but **pricing responses varied widely**:  \n  - Firms reported strategies such as **absorbing cost increases**, **negotiating with suppliers**, and **passing costs through to customers**. The choice among these options was caused by each firm’s demand conditions and customer sensitivity.  \n  - **Some auto manufacturers** “felt the pinch from tariffs on new car sales” but **absorbed these increases** to avoid further demand declines. Here, tariffs caused higher costs, but fear of losing sales caused firms to **hold prices down**, cutting margins instead.  \n  - A few **service-oriented firms** said they could **raise prices without pushback**, so tariffs caused both higher costs and **higher final prices** in those niches.  \n  - Contacts warned that **“price pass-through resulting from tariffs has just begun and expect to see prices rise into 2026.”** This means tariffs have already raised costs, but only part of those costs has reached consumers so far; the rest is expected to show up gradually as firms stop absorbing costs.  \n  - In related markets, **steel prices flattened amid slower demand**, and some producers **held prices steady to preserve strong margins**. This outcome was caused more by weaker demand than by tariffs, but it shows that even with cost pressures, firms sometimes chose not to cut or raise prices because of margin and demand considerations.\n\n**Richmond (Fifth District)**  \n- In Richmond, tariffs **raised input costs** in both manufacturing and services, leading to **mixed pass-through**:  \n  - Manufacturers saw a **“slight increase in prices received,”** and firms **explicitly cited tariffs**. This was caused by firms passing at least part of their higher costs through to customers.  \n  - Survey data show **both manufacturers and service-sector firms** reporting tariffs as adding to input costs, but **“some of which have yet to be passed along to customers.”** That is, tariffs caused higher costs, but incomplete pass-through kept some of the impact at the firm level.  \n  - **A couple of firms** said they **expected to raise prices once they worked through pre‑tariff inventory.** This is a clear causal sequence: tariffs raised replacement costs; firms used cheaper pre‑tariff inventory to delay price hikes; when that inventory runs out, they expect prices to rise.\n\n**Cleveland (Fourth District)**  \n- In Cleveland, tariffs **frequently drove up nonlabor input costs**:  \n  - Manufacturers reported tariff-related increases for **raw materials, imported components, and chemicals**. Retailers cited tariff-driven increases on **vehicles, beef, coffee, and chocolate**.  \n  - As a result, firms **faced strong cost pressures** and **expected costs to grow at a strong pace in coming months**, though the text does not quantify how much was already passed through versus absorbed.  \n  - In some product categories, foreign suppliers cut prices to maintain sales: **“foreign producers were factoring in tariffs and cutting prices accordingly to retain market share.”** This was caused by tariffs making their goods more expensive at the U.S. border, which prompted them to reduce pre-tariff prices. That behavior **muted how much of the tariff ultimately reached U.S. buyers and consumers**.\n\n**Chicago (Seventh District)**  \n- In Chicago, tariffs mainly showed up through **higher input costs and cautious pass-through**:  \n  - Manufacturers attributed **higher metals prices to tariffs**, so tariffs caused material cost increases in sectors relying on aluminum, copper, and steel.  \n  - On the retail side, a sector analyst noted retailers were **“trying to hold off passing tariff-related cost increases on to consumers for as long as possible.”** This was caused by competitive pressures and fear of losing customers.  \n  - However, **“several smaller retailers reported already raising prices because of tariffs.”** In those cases, tariffs directly caused **higher consumer prices**, likely because smaller firms had less room to absorb costs.\n\n**Philadelphia (Third District)**  \n- In Philadelphia, tariffs contributed to **broad cost pressure and planned price increases**:  \n  - Firms reported **“increased cost pressures from tariffs and other business expenses”**.  \n  - As a result, they **“expect to raise prices in the coming months to offset these higher costs.”** Here, tariffs are a direct cause of the expected future price hikes, though current pass-through was still moderate (“prices continued to rise moderately”).  \n  - Manufacturing activity rose moderately, while many retailers and auto dealers faced tepid demand; that demand weakness likely constrained how quickly they could pass through tariff costs.\n\n**San Francisco (Twelfth District)**  \n- In San Francisco, tariffs produced a **clear split between who absorbed costs and who raised prices**:  \n  - **Higher import duties** led to **“widespread cost increases”** for imported supplies.  \n  - **Many suppliers absorbed some of the price increases.** This was caused by competitive pressure: they cut their own margins to avoid losing U.S. customers.  \n  - **Retailers, especially in mid- to high-end markets, “reported passing a sizable portion [of the cost increase] onto consumers.”** This means tariffs caused noticeably higher prices for mid‑ and high‑end consumers, because those buyers were less price‑sensitive and retailers had more pricing power.  \n  - In food service, **restaurateurs** faced high ingredient costs (partly tariff-driven) but **customer resistance to higher menu prices**. As a result, instead of fully raising prices, some **reduced portion sizes or changed recipes**. Here, tariffs caused cost pressure, but customer pushback caused firms to use **non-price adjustments** or only partial pass-through.\n\n**Other Districts and cross-cutting patterns**  \n- The National Summary also notes that **waning demand pushed prices down for some materials**, such as **steel in the Sixth District** and **lumber in the Twelfth District**, showing that demand conditions sometimes offset tariff effects on final prices.  \n- In **New York**, not detailed above but covered in the sub-answers, firms reported cases where **foreign manufacturers (e.g., in pharmaceuticals)** absorbed tariff costs to maintain market share, again blunting pass-through to U.S. prices. New York manufacturers and brewers also reported **raising prices** to reflect higher input costs, including those from tariffs.\n\n**3. Comparative cause–effect differences between Districts**  \n- **Where tariffs most clearly raised *final* prices now:**  \n  - **Richmond manufacturing**, **some Atlanta firms and services**, **smaller Chicago retailers**, **mid‑ to high‑end retailers in San Francisco**, and various manufacturers and retailers nationally are reported as having *already* raised prices because tariffs increased their costs.  \n- **Where tariffs mainly raised *costs* but not yet prices:**  \n  - Parts of **Atlanta** (especially some auto manufacturers), **Richmond services**, and many **Chicago and national retailers** chose to **absorb costs or delay pass-through** because of weak demand and customer pushback.  \n- **Where foreign suppliers muted the effect:**  \n  - In **Cleveland** and **New York**, foreign producers or manufacturers **cut their own prices or absorbed tariffs**. This was caused by their desire to retain market share, which reduced how much of the tariff ultimately showed up in U.S. price levels.  \n- **Where future pass-through is expected:**  \n  - **Atlanta** explicitly: firms say tariff pass-through has “just begun” and **expect prices to rise into 2026** because of tariffs.  \n  - **Philadelphia, Cleveland, and others** expect to raise prices *“in the coming months”* as they move from absorbing costs toward passing them on.\n\n**4. Overall causal picture**  \n- **Tariffs → higher import and input costs** across many Districts (manufacturing, some services, and certain consumer goods).  \n- **Higher costs → different pricing choices**, depending on sector, District, and customer price sensitivity:  \n  - In sectors and markets with stronger demand or less price sensitivity (e.g., manufacturing in Richmond, mid‑ to high‑end retail in San Francisco, some national manufacturing and retail firms), tariffs **caused higher final prices** via full or substantial pass-through.  \n  - In segments facing weak demand or strong customer pushback (e.g., some Atlanta auto sales, many Chicago and national retailers, restaurants in San Francisco), tariffs **caused margin compression and delayed or partial pass-through**, sometimes leading firms to adjust quantities or product features instead of headline prices.  \n- Because of these differing responses and timing, **tariff effects on prices were uneven across Districts**: some showed noticeable tariff-driven price increases already, while others mainly reported higher costs now and **planned price increases later** as absorption becomes unsustainable.\n\nIn short, tariffs broadly **pushed costs up everywhere**, but whether and when that translated into higher consumer prices depended on each District’s mix of industries, demand conditions, and customer price sensitivity. Where firms had room to raise prices, tariffs led to immediate inflationary pressure; where they did not, the effect was absorbed in margins or deferred, with further price increases expected over time.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Tariffs raised input costs across many Districts.\n2) The degree of pass‑through to final prices varied.\n3) Some firms kept selling prices unchanged (absorbed costs) to preserve market share / due to customer pushback.\n4) Other firms fully passed higher import costs on to customers.\n\nThe system answer clearly contains all of these elements:\n- It repeatedly states that tariffs caused \"tariff-induced input cost increases\" and higher import duties across many Districts (matches point 1).\n- It describes in detail that pricing responses \"varied widely\" across Districts and sectors, emphasizing uneven and mixed pass‑through (matches point 2).\n- It notes many firms \"absorbed cost increases,\" \"kept their selling prices largely unchanged,\" or delayed pass‑through because of competitive pressures and price‑sensitive clients, preserving market share and compressing margins (matches point 3).\n- It also specifies that some firms \"fully passed higher import costs along to their customers,\" and gives concrete examples (e.g., Richmond manufacturing, smaller Chicago retailers, mid‑ to high‑end retailers in San Francisco) (matches point 4).\n\nThere are no contradictions with the expected answer; the system answer is more detailed but consistent and accurate relative to the ground truth summary. Therefore it is fully correct, not merely partial.",

However, the system also adds:\n- In the Tenth District, construction materials in general saw price decreases (specific materials not identified).\n\nThis third bullet is not present in the expected answer and is presented as a factual claim. Because we only know the ground truth mentions price declines for steel in the Sixth and lumber in the Twelfth, the added statement about the Tenth District is unsupported and likely fabricated relative to the provided ground truth.

      "system_answer": "Residential real estate conditions were generally flat to slightly weaker, while commercial real estate was mostly flat to slightly improving, with notable regional and sectoral differences.\n\n• Residential real estate\n  • Overall tone: “Flat to slightly weaker” across Districts. Several areas (Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, San Francisco) reported residential activity as unchanged or somewhat down. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  • Market dynamics: Contacts described a “slow” market with longer listing times. In multiple regions, inventories increased, shifting single‑family housing from a strong seller’s market to what one source called “barely a seller’s market.” This led to more price reductions and “more right” (less aggressive) pricing after several years of strong price gains. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  • Prices and rents: In some locations house prices were declining or stabilizing rather than continuing rapid increases. Rents were described as flat to modestly higher overall, but rent concessions for new multifamily tenants became more common in at least one District. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  • Affordability: Affordability remained a significant concern in some areas, constraining demand. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• Commercial real estate\n  • Overall tone: Conditions were generally flat to slightly improving, with wide variation by location and property type. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  • Boston District: “Commercial real estate activity was up slightly net of seasonal factors,” supported by a seasonal uptick in office leasing after Labor Day and “some large office deals.” Office rents were flat, operating costs continued to rise, and construction activity “remained limited” because construction costs faced upward pressure from tariffs and labor shortages. The outlook was “cautiously optimistic,” and contacts said a recent reduction in the federal funds rate “lifted sentiment somewhat.” Retail leasing was stable with modest rent growth and low vacancies; apartment rents rose only slightly, a slowdown from earlier in the year. [BeigeBook_20251015, Boston > Commercial Real Estate]\n  • Dallas District: Commercial real estate “improved” overall. Office leasing improved and appeared more stable, and industrial and retail activity remained solid. However, elevated new apartment supply made leasing competitive and kept rental rates under pressure. Outlooks “remained cautious,” with firms favoring short‑term leases amid heightened uncertainty and weak investment sales. [BeigeBook_20251015, Dallas > Construction and Real Estate]\n\n• Direct comparisons between residential and commercial\n  • Minneapolis: “Commercial real estate was flat” while “residential real estate fell,” indicating residential conditions were weaker than commercial in that District. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  • Chicago: Both sectors saw mild strengthening—“residential construction edged up” and “commercial real estate activity also increased slightly”—suggesting roughly parallel, modest improvement in both residential and commercial markets there. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nIn sum, residential markets were characterized by slower activity, rising inventories, softening or stabilizing prices, and ongoing affordability challenges, whereas commercial markets tended to be flat to slightly improving, with specific strength in some office, retail, and industrial segments but constrained new construction and generally cautious outlooks.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the expected answer: conditions in residential and commercial real estate were *mixed*, with some reports noting improved business lending recently due to lower interest rates, while others continued to report muted activity. The focus is on:\n- Mixed conditions in these interest-rate-sensitive sectors\n- Some improvement in business lending tied to lower rates\n- Ongoing muted activity elsewhere\n\nThe system answer instead:\n- Describes residential as “flat to slightly weaker” and commercial as “flat to slightly improving,” with detailed narratives about listing times, inventories, prices, rents, affordability, construction, and district-specific anecdotes.\n\nIssues:\n- It does not mention the central point about *mixed* conditions framed in terms of business lending and lower interest rates, nor the contrast between improved lending and muted activity.\n- It introduces many specific details (district-level comments, tariffs, labor shortages, etc.) that are not in the expected answer and may not align with the referenced context.\n- By characterizing residential as generally weaker and commercial as generally flat to improving, it implicitly presents a more uniform picture rather than the “mixed” conditions described in the ground truth.\n\nBecause the crucial elements (mixed conditions plus the role of lower interest rates improving business lending versus continuing muted activity) are missing, and the answer instead supplies a different characterization, the response does not capture the key facts from the expected answer and is not just incomplete but substantively different. That makes it incorrect relative to the ground truth specification, not just partially correct.\n",

      "expected_answer": "Home sales were flat from a year earlier in the Boston District, while housing inventory increased notably.",
      "system_answer": "Over the most recent year covered (through August 2025), home sales in the Boston District showed very little change overall, with some differences by property type:\n\n**August 2024 → August 2025 (year‑over‑year comparison)**\n- **Overall home sales:**\n  - By the time of the October 15, 2025 Beige Book, **home sales in the Boston District were described as “flat from a year earlier,”** meaning the total sales volume was essentially unchanged compared with a year before.\n\n- **Single‑family homes (as of August 2025 vs. August 2024):**\n  - **Closed sales were “flat or down slightly overall … compared with the previous August.”**\n  - This indicates that, relative to August 2024, single‑family activity had not grown and, in some areas, had edged a bit lower.\n\n- **Condos (as of August 2025 vs. August 2024):**\n  - **Condo sales “increased slightly across the First District on average,”** though results varied by state.\n  - So, while overall home sales were flat, the **condo segment showed a small year‑over‑year uptick** in transactions.\n\n- **Price and rent dynamics over the same period (context for sales behavior):**\n  - **House prices:** “**rose moderately on average from a year earlier,**” but the pace of increase had **slowed relative to the prior Beige Book period** (earlier in 2025).\n  - **Condo prices:** **“fell modestly in some areas,”** suggesting some softening even as condo sales volumes ticked up slightly.\n  - **Apartment rents:** **“rose only slightly, representing a slowdown from earlier in the year,”** indicating that rent growth was decelerating as 2025 progressed.\n\n- **Buyer behavior (especially by mid‑2025):**\n  - A Massachusetts contact reported that **buyers became increasingly selective and patient, especially in the condo market.** This points to slower decision‑making and a more cautious pace of transactions, even though the aggregate sales numbers year‑over‑year were roughly flat.\n\n**In summary over time (through August 2025):**\n- Compared with the same period a year earlier, **overall home sales in the Boston District did not materially change**—they remained essentially flat.\n- Within that flat total, **single‑family sales were flat to slightly lower**, while **condo sales were up slightly** year‑over‑year as of August 2025.\n- Throughout this period, **house prices continued to rise but more slowly**, some **condo prices slipped**, and **rent increases moderated**, all within an environment the Fed described as one of **slight economic expansion with a neutral‑to‑cautiously‑optimistic outlook but mostly downside risks.**",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Home sales in the Boston District were flat from a year earlier.\n2) Housing inventory increased notably.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer correctly states that home sales in the Boston District were “flat from a year earlier” and reinforces that overall home sales did not materially change year‑over‑year. This matches key fact (1).\n- However, it does not mention housing inventory at all, let alone that it “increased notably.” Instead, it adds a lot of extra detail about property types, prices, rents, and buyer behavior that are not in the ground truth. Those additions are not necessarily wrong, but they do not address the missing key fact about inventory.\n- There are no explicit contradictions of the ground truth; the answer is just incomplete relative to the expected answer.\n\nBecause the system captures the flat sales but omits the notable increase in inventory, with no factual errors, the answer is incomplete but not misleading.\n\nTherefore the correct verdict is PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

      "question": "How did lower interest rates affect business activity?",
      "expected_answer": "Commercial construction and financial services contacts noted an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates. Some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates.",
      "system_answer": "Lower interest rates affected business activity through several linked cause‑and‑effect channels, but their impact was limited where broader headwinds were strong.\n\n1. Cheaper borrowing → higher loan demand → more business activity\n- **Cause:** The central factor was that lower interest rates reduced the cost of borrowing for firms and households.\n- **Effect:** This was caused by banks being able to offer loans at lower interest costs, which **encouraged more loan demand and investment**. District reports indicated **moderately higher loan demand from both households and businesses** when rates fell, with some banks expecting a **sharp increase in loan demand** as additional cuts were anticipated. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **As a result,** activity picked up particularly in **rate‑sensitive areas** such as commercial construction, real estate, and business lending, since projects that depend heavily on financing became more viable.\n\n2. Lower rates → stronger activity in rate‑sensitive sectors\n- **Cause:** Sectors whose profits depend heavily on financing costs—like construction and real estate—are especially sensitive to interest rates.\n- **Effect:** This was caused by the decline in short‑term interest rates making new projects and expansions cheaper to finance. For example:\n  - **Commercial construction firms and real estate developers** (notably in the Cleveland District) **“saw a modest increase in demand” and “undertook more capital spending as they adapted to tariffs and as short‑term interest rates declined.”** [Cleveland – Real Estate and Construction]\n  - **Commercial construction and financial services contacts** in Cleveland **“noted an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates.”** [National Summary – Cleveland; Cleveland – Summary of Economic Activity]\n- **As a result,** more capital projects went forward, including construction tied to **multinational manufacturers expanding domestic capacity**, and financial services firms experienced higher demand for financing products.\n\n3. Lower rates → improved financing conditions → more capital spending (in some areas)\n- **Cause:** The cheaper and more accessible credit environment improved financing conditions for firms considering investment.\n- **Effect:** This was caused by firms finding it easier to justify **capital spending** when interest costs fell. For example:\n  - **Real estate developers and a commercial builder** reported **undertaking more capital spending** as they both adapted to tariffs and responded to **declining short‑term rates**. [Cleveland – Real Estate and Construction]\n- **As a result,** new construction and investment projects were initiated that might have been delayed or canceled in a higher‑rate environment.\n\n4. Why lower rates did *not* always translate into strong business activity\nEven with these positive channels, the overall effect was often muted.\n\n4.1. Uncertainty, inflation, and weak demand → muted response to low rates\n- **Cause:** Elevated economic uncertainty (especially about tariffs and trade policy), persistent inflation, small increases in unemployment, and generally **waning demand** in some sectors.\n- **Effect:** This was caused by firms’ concern that future conditions might deteriorate, leading them to hold back on borrowing and investing even when rates were lower. Evidence notes that these factors were **“keeping loan demand weak” despite lower rates.** [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **As a result,** in several districts **overall business activity remained flat or muted**:\n  - The **Cleveland** District described overall business activity as **“flat,”** despite the rate‑driven strength in construction and financial services. [Cleveland – Summary of Economic Activity]\n  - **Boston manufacturing contacts** reported **capital expenditures were unchanged**, citing **elevated uncertainty from tariffs, inflation, and general uncertainty**, rather than responding to lower rates with more investment. [Boston – Manufacturing and Related Services]\n  - In **Dallas commercial real estate**, firms’ **outlooks remained cautious**, and many signed **short‑term leases** because of heightened uncertainty, limiting long‑term commitments even as leasing activity showed some improvement. [Dallas – Construction and Real Estate]\n\n4.2. Sector‑specific weakness → limited gains from lower rates\n- **Cause:** Structural or cyclical weakness in certain industries—such as **manufacturing, agriculture, energy, and transportation**—together with tariff impacts and soft demand. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Effect:** This was caused by profit pressures and risk concerns that outweighed the benefit of cheaper credit.\n- **As a result,** **commercial loan demand stayed muted** in many of these sectors even after rate reductions, and business activity did not rise strongly. In some cases, activity only picked up where there were **independent drivers**, such as **large semiconductor investments in Arizona**, which created their own demand for financing regardless of rates. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nSummary of the cause‑effect chain:\n- **Lower interest rates → cheaper borrowing → higher loan demand and easier financing conditions.**\n- **Cheaper borrowing and easier financing → more capital spending and project starts**, especially in commercial construction, real estate, and financial services, which **boosted business activity** in these rate‑sensitive areas.\n- **However, elevated uncertainty, inflation, sectoral weakness, and soft demand → firms’ caution and flat capital expenditures in many regions**, which **tempered or offset the stimulative effect** of lower rates on overall business activity.\n\nSo, lower interest rates did stimulate business activity—mainly via increased borrowing and investment in interest‑sensitive sectors—but this effect was significantly constrained wherever broader economic headwinds and uncertainty dominated firms’ decisions.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Lower interest rates led to an uptick in demand for commercial construction.\n2) Lower interest rates led to an uptick in demand for financial services.\n3) Some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer explicitly states: “Commercial construction and financial services contacts in Cleveland ‘noted an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates.’” This directly matches points (1) and (2).\n- It also notes: “District reports indicated moderately higher loan demand from both households and businesses when rates fell…,” and, “commercial loan demand stayed muted in many of these sectors even after rate reductions,” but earlier it clearly describes higher loan demand and improved financing conditions, which covers (3) about improved business lending.\n- There are no contradictions with the expected answer. The system adds more context (channels, muted effects, uncertainty) but these do not conflict with the ground truth.\n\nAll key elements of the ground truth are present and correctly represented, with additional but consistent detail. Therefore the answer is correct.",

[BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Small business credit:** Another banker noted that **small business demand for credit was depressed**, but that **the pipeline was building back up**, suggesting subdued current borrowing with signs of future pickup. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Credit quality and household stress:** Contacts reported that **consumer delinquency rates have been steadily increasing over the past few months and are expected to continue rising**, and one banker saw more borrowers going to **credit counseling agencies after borrowing to maintain their level of spending**—evidence of growing stress on household finances. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Lending standards:** In response, **banks tightened lending standards**, including **higher equity requirements**, **more scrutiny of small business loans**, and **limited access to credit for smaller investors**, even as overall credit conditions were still described as strong. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Deposits:** The St. Louis Beige Book excerpt **does not provide specific information on deposit levels or competition for deposits**.\n\nIn sum, the state of banking activity in the St. Louis District was **stable and unchanged overall**, with **moderate loan demand and strong credit conditions**, but with **rising consumer delinquencies and tighter lending standards**, especially affecting small businesses and smaller investors.

      "system_answer": "Over the most recent reporting period, financial conditions in the Chicago District evolved as follows, moving from tighter to somewhat easier overall, with notable differences between late August and September 2025:\n\n**Late August 2025**  \n- Credit remained broadly available, but lending standards were already on the cautious side.  \n- Business loan demand began to soften, in part because there was less acquisition activity.  \n- Banks started to see a **modest decline in business loan quality**, which set the stage for tighter terms on some commercial credit.  \n- Consumer credit conditions were relatively stable: consumer loan quality was flat, and demand from households was steady to slightly improving.\n\n**Late August to September 2025**  \n- **Overall financial conditions loosened slightly** in the Chicago District, even as some underlying components moved in different directions. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - **Market conditions:** Bond and equity values **rose modestly**, indicating some improvement in financial markets and asset prices.  \n  - **Interest rates:** Both business and consumer loan rates **edged down**, contributing to somewhat easier borrowing conditions from a pricing standpoint.  \n\n- **Business credit conditions (tightening terms, weaker demand):**  \n  - On net, **business loan demand decreased slightly**, reflecting softer acquisition and investment activity. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - With **business loan quality declining modestly**, banks responded by **tightening loan terms** (for example, stricter covenants or collateral requirements), even as nominal interest rates moved down.  \n  - The result was a mix of **lower borrowing costs but stricter non‑price terms** for many firms.\n\n- **Household/consumer credit conditions (slightly stronger demand):**  \n  - **Consumer loan demand increased slightly**, helped by a pickup in **mortgage refinancing** as rates edged down. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - **Consumer loan quality remained flat**, so lenders only **tightened consumer terms slightly**, much less than on the business side.  \n  - Combined with the small decline in consumer rates, households faced **somewhat easier overall conditions** than businesses.\n\n**Net change over the reporting period (through mid-October 2025)**  \n- By the end of the period covered in the October 15, 2025 Beige Book, the Chicago District’s **overall financial conditions were described as slightly looser** than at the start. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- This loosening was driven primarily by:  \n  - modest increases in bond and equity prices, and  \n  - small declines in loan interest rates.  \n- At the same time, **credit supply to businesses became more selective**, with tighter terms and softer demand, while **household credit saw mildly stronger demand under only slightly stricter terms**.\n\nChronologically, then, conditions shifted from cautious but stable in late August, to **somewhat easier overall by late September and early October 2025**, with the easing most visible in market prices and borrowing costs, and the tightening most visible in the non‑price terms of business lending.",
      "verdict": "correct",

These are not in conflict with the ground truth as stated, and nothing directly contradicts the expected answer.\n- No statement contradicts the ground truth about direction of financial conditions, asset prices, or loan demand.\n- The only ground-truth element omitted is the note that volatility remained unchanged; omission alone does not make the answer incorrect if other elements are accurate.\n\nBecause all key directional facts from the expected answer are correctly captured (loosening, higher bond/equity values, lower business loan demand tied to less acquisition activity), and there are no factual contradictions with the ground truth, the answer is complete enough to be considered correct, despite not mentioning volatility explicitly.\n\nVerdict: correct.",

      "question": "What were the conditions in the agriculture sector?",
      "expected_answer": "Agriculture conditions were mixed across reporting Districts. In St. Louis, agriculture conditions are strained and have further deteriorated. In Chicago, crops were in good shape across most of the District, though soybean prices were lower due to absence of new-crop exports to China. In Atlanta, overall demand for agricultural products was healthy. Minneapolis agricultural contacts were concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases.",
      "system_answer": "Conditions in the agriculture sector were generally weak and, in many areas, deteriorating.\n\n• Overall performance: Federal Reserve District reports indicated a soft agricultural economy, with many producers under financial strain and an outlook that was slightly pessimistic in several regions. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• Crop producers:\n  - Commodity prices for major crops were low or only marginally profitable, leaving many operations with tight or negative margins.\n  - Input costs—especially for fertilizer—were elevated and in some cases still rising, eroding already thin profit margins.\n  - Weather problems (including yield and quality issues tied to adverse conditions such as La Niña in some regions) further reduced returns.\n  - In certain regions, credit conditions for crop farmers were “sharply strained,” with heightened concern about loan repayment capacity and even fears of bankruptcy for the most leveraged operations. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• Livestock and protein producers:\n  - In contrast, conditions for livestock were relatively strong: cattle and hog prices were at or near record highs.\n  - Strong demand for protein supported the financial performance of diversified operations that included livestock, making this segment a relative bright spot.\n  - However, labor availability was a significant constraint for many livestock and protein businesses, limiting their ability to fully capitalize on favorable prices. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• Trade, costs, and investment:\n  - Export demand was weaker, notably from China, weighing on some commodity prices and farm revenues.\n  - High financing and packaging costs added further pressure on margins.\n  - Elevated uncertainty about prices, costs, and demand was causing many producers to delay or scale back capital investments. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nIn summary, the agriculture sector was characterized by financially stressed crop producers facing high costs and low prices, relatively strong but capacity‑constrained livestock/protein operations, and an overall environment of weaker demand, tight credit for some, and cautious investment behavior. [BeigeBook_20251015]",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Expected: agriculture conditions were *mixed* across districts, with specific regional details: (1) St. Louis strained and deteriorating; (2) Chicago mostly good crop conditions but lower soybean prices due to lack of new‑crop exports to China; (3) Atlanta healthy overall demand for agricultural products; (4) Minneapolis contacts concerned about China eliminating soybean purchases. \n\nSystem answer: portrays agriculture as \"generally weak\" and deteriorating overall; discusses low crop prices, high input costs, weather issues, tight credit, relatively strong livestock, weak export demand (including China), high costs, and delayed investment. It does not mention any of the specific district‑level conditions (St. Louis, Chicago, Atlanta, Minneapolis), nor the specific nuance that conditions were mixed across districts or that Chicago crops were in good shape and Atlanta demand was healthy. The overall characterization (generally weak and deteriorating) conflicts with the ground truth characterization (mixed, including some healthy/good areas). While it does include an element about weaker export demand from China, it frames it broadly and not as Minneapolis soybean-purchase elimination. The answer clearly is not an abstention. It introduces a lot of additional, more detailed narrative that is not supported by the expected answer and contradicts the central \"mixed\" characterization.\n\nBecause it misses all key specific facts and directly contradicts the main point (mixed vs generally weak), the answer is not partially correct; it is incorrect relative to the expected answer.",

      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth clearly states that Minneapolis District agricultural contacts were concerned about China’s elimination of soybean purchases. The system answer explicitly claims the opposite: that Minneapolis agricultural contacts are not recorded as expressing any specific concerns about China and that there is no documented China-specific concern from Minneapolis. This directly contradicts the expected answer. Therefore, the system answer is factually incorrect relative to the ground truth, not just incomplete or abstaining.",

The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book notes that:\n\n- Drilling activity showed no significant increase or decrease, remaining unchanged overall.  \n- Well completion activity likewise showed no growth, indicating a stagnant pace of bringing wells online.  \n\nThis flat activity occurred in the context of a subdued energy sector, with low oil prices and rising input/breakeven costs limiting incentives to expand drilling or completions. Oil production was also described as flat under these conditions. [BeigeBook_20251015]",

      "system_answer": "The report indicated a generally modest and uneven outlook for future economic growth, with expectations varying by region and sector rather than a single, strong growth narrative.\n\nNationally:\n- Many contacts expected **only a modest uptick in demand over the next 6–12 months**, and the Beige Book explicitly noted **no numeric GDP-style projections**, only qualitative expectations for modest growth. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- At the same time, **elevated uncertainty was widely cited as a factor that would continue to weigh on activity**, including downside risks such as a potentially prolonged government shutdown in at least one District. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nRegional details:\n- **Boston:** Outlook described as **“neutral to cautiously optimistic”**, but with **mostly downside risks**, implying limited upside and concern about potential negative shocks. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Kansas City:** Contacts broadly **expect higher sales and employment in 2026 than in 2025** and anticipate **more favorable economic conditions next year**, signaling comparatively stronger optimism about **medium‑term growth**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Philadelphia:** Firms, particularly in nonmanufacturing, **generally expect modest growth over the next six months**, and those expectations are **below historical averages**, indicating **tempered near‑term growth**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Dallas:** Bankers foresee an **acceleration in loan demand and increasing business activity over the next six months**, suggesting some pickup in regional economic momentum. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **St. Louis:** Reports that **“the outlook remains slightly pessimistic,”** pointing to weaker expectations relative to other regions. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nOverall, the outlook was for **modest, uneven future growth**: some Districts—especially Kansas City and parts of Dallas—anticipated better conditions and stronger demand over the next year, while others—such as St. Louis and Philadelphia—reported **pessimistic or below‑average expectations**, with national sentiment constrained by ongoing uncertainty.

It also gives regional examples of more optimistic districts (Kansas City, Dallas), consistent with sentiment improving in some areas.\n- It explicitly notes that “elevated uncertainty was widely cited as a factor that would continue to weigh on activity,” which aligns with point (3).\n- There are no contradictions with the ground truth; the answer adds extra regional detail, but it is in line with the core message: varied outlook, some modest expected improvement, and ongoing uncertainty weighing on activity.\n\nAll key elements are present and accurate, with no evident errors relative to the expected answer, just additional elaboration.\n",

      "system_answer": "The “state of transportation activity” was generally soft to slightly declining, with notable variation by mode and region. Overall, freight and logistics activity showed modest weakness rather than broad expansion:\n\n- Trucking and over-the-road freight: Activity was subdued, with modest overall declines. Firms reported softer demand, excess trucking capacity, and weaker shipments of consumer goods, indicating that the trucking market was oversupplied relative to current freight volumes. \n\n- Rail: Rail freight volumes were also described as soft in several Districts. However, there were some offsets in specific segments, such as increased intermodal volumes (containers and trailers on flatcars), reflecting ongoing shifts in supply-chain and shipping strategies. \n\n- Ports and container traffic: Port activity was a relative bright spot. Several ports reported robust container volumes, suggesting continued strength in international trade flows and import/export logistics even as some domestic trucking and rail segments weakened. \n\n- Airlines and passenger transportation: Passenger air travel showed improvement in some regions, with higher airline passenger demand. This contrasted with the softness in freight, indicating stronger conditions in passenger transportation than in goods movement. \n\nAcross the Federal Reserve Districts cited, this meant transportation and logistics were generally in a state of modest contraction or softness, punctuated by pockets of strength in port container traffic, intermodal rail, and airline passenger demand, and characterized by sector-specific issues like excess truck capacity and weaker consumer-goods shipments. [BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Ground truth: transportation activity was generally down among reporting Districts, and in the Atlanta District transportation declined. The key facts: (1) overall transportation activity down/declining; (2) specifically, Atlanta District transportation declined. \n\nSystem answer: describes transportation as “generally soft to slightly declining,” “modest weakness,” “modest contraction or softness,” which is consistent with “generally down.” However, it does not mention the Atlanta District at all, nor that transportation in Atlanta declined. It also introduces a lot of modal and regional detail (ports bright spot, passenger airlines improving, etc.) that are not in the ground truth, but they are not presented as contradicting the overall softness; still, they are not supported by the given expected answer, but the task is to compare for correctness vs ground truth, not source-citation.\n\nThere is no direct contradiction of the ground truth’s core point that transportation was generally down; rather, the system’s phrasing aligns with that. The missing piece is the specific Atlanta District decline. Thus the answer contains some but not all key facts and is incomplete but not wrong relative to the expected answer.",

[Kansas City, Labor Markets]\n\n- **San Francisco District – manufacturing and health care**  \n  - *Cause:* “investment in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly for positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees.”  \n  - *Effect:* “several contacts in manufacturing and health care noted reductions in staff levels through attrition, layoffs, and early retirements,” and these reductions were “coupled with” the AI investments.  \n  → This was caused by AI being deployed to handle routine or junior‑level work, which led firms to shrink staff doing those tasks. [San Francisco, Labor Markets]\n\n- **National (across multiple Districts)**  \n  - *Cause:* “increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies,” along with weaker demand and economic uncertainty.  \n  - *Effect:* “more employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition, with contacts citing… in some cases, increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies.”  \n  → This was caused by AI contributing to lower labor requirements in some firms, which they then addressed by cutting or not replacing workers. [National Summary, Labor Markets]\n\nOverall, AI is described as a **productivity/automation tool**: it reduces the volume of human work required and thereby **causes** firms to lower headcounts.\n\n---\n### 2. AI and generative AI → Expectations of further workforce cuts\n\n**Cause:** Early implementation of (especially generative) AI demonstrated to some firms that they could operate with fewer workers.\n\n**Effect:** These firms planned or expected additional cuts, conditional on demand.\n\n- **Atlanta District – some firms**  \n  - *Cause:* “early Generative AI implementation results” showed that work could be done with fewer people.  \n  - *Effect:* “Recently, however, head count reductions were cited more frequently, and **some firms expect further cuts based on early Generative AI implementation results, particularly if demand slows further.**”  \n  → This was caused by the initial success of generative AI pilots; as a result, if business conditions weaken, those firms intend to rely more on AI and cut more staff. [Atlanta, Labor Markets]\n\n---\n### 3. AI → Weaker demand for entry‑level and less‑experienced workers\n\n**Cause:** AI tools were implemented specifically for tasks and positions historically done by less‑experienced or entry‑level employees.\n\n**Effect:** Firms reduced those roles, or planned to hire fewer people into them.\n\n- **San Francisco District – less‑experienced roles in manufacturing and health care**  \n  - *Cause:* AI systems targeted “positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees.”  \n  - *Effect:* Staff reductions (attrition, layoffs, early retirements) were “coupled with” this AI investment.  \n  → This was caused by AI substituting for junior workers’ tasks, leading to fewer such positions. [San Francisco, Labor Markets]\n\n- **Minneapolis District – advertising firm’s entry‑level roles**  \n  - *Cause:* AI tools that “get this work done faster,” referring to entry‑level advertising tasks.  \n  - *Effect:* A Minnesota advertising firm “expects a smaller need for entry‑level folks” because of these tools.  \n  → This was caused by AI speeding up production on junior‑level work; as a result, the firm plans to hire fewer entry‑level staff. [Minneapolis, Labor Markets]\n\nAcross these cases, AI **shifted the composition of labor demand** by making firms feel they need **fewer junior workers**.\n\n---\n### 4. AI → Indirect influence on hiring/firing, not automated HR decision‑making\n\n**Cause:** AI improved productivity and reduced task‑level labor needs; managers then made strategic staffing decisions in response.\n\n**Effect:** Employment outcomes changed (layoffs, slower hiring), but AI did **not** directly make individual HR decisions in the reported cases.\n\nEvidence across the Beige Book excerpts shows:\n- AI is linked to **overall staffing changes** (layoffs, attrition, reduced hiring), not to individual algorithmic decisions about **who** to fire, **who** to hire, or **who** to promote.  \n- Phrases like “associated with the adoption and implementation of AI capabilities that reduced overall labor needs” [Kansas City] and “coupled with investment in AI” [San Francisco] describe managers responding to AI‑driven productivity gains, not AI systems autonomously executing HR rules.\n\nAs a result:\n- The **primary causal channel** documented is: **AI → lower required labor input → managerial decisions to cut or slow growth in headcount.**  \n- There is **no reported case** in these excerpts where AI systems directly execute or automate firing, promotion, or performance‑evaluation decisions.\n\n---\n### 5. AI → No documented effects on bias or fairness (in this source)\n\n**Cause:** AI’s role, as described in the Beige Book, is framed purely in terms of productivity and labor demand.\n\n**Effect:** The report does **not** discuss bias, discrimination, or fairness in employment decisions.\n\n- Across the National Summary and District reports (Kansas City, San Francisco, Atlanta, Minneapolis), there are **no references** to algorithmic discrimination, fairness audits, or regulatory concerns about AI in hiring, promotion, or firing.  \n- All described impacts run through **quantities of labor** (how many people are employed and at what levels of experience), not through **who** is selected or how fairly.\n\nAs a result, from this report alone, we can only say that AI **caused changes in employment volume and composition**, not that it is reported to have caused changes (positive or negative) in fairness outcomes.\n\n---\n### 6. Net picture of how AI affected employment decisions\n\nPulling these threads together, the main causal relationships are:\n\n1. **AI adoption and investment**  \n   → **Reduced overall labor needs**, especially for routine and less‑experienced tasks  \n   → **Layoffs, attrition, and early retirements**, particularly in professional services (Kansas City) and in manufacturing and health care (San Francisco).  \n\n2. **Early generative AI successes**  \n   → Firms **perceive they can operate with fewer workers**  \n   → **Expectations of further workforce cuts**, especially if demand weakens (Atlanta).  \n\n3. **AI tools that speed up junior‑level work**  \n   → **Dampened demand for entry‑level workers**, as firms foresee “a smaller need for entry-level folks” (Minneapolis) and target less‑experienced roles with automation (San Francisco).  \n\n4. **Managerial responses to AI‑driven productivity**  \n   → AI acts as an **indirect driver** of hiring and firing decisions by changing how much labor is needed, rather than directly executing HR judgments.  \n\nWithin the evidence provided, artificial intelligence **caused employment decisions to shift toward smaller and more experienced workforces**, with reductions concentrated where AI could most easily replace routine, junior tasks, while leaving questions of fairness and bias unaddressed in this particular source.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth answer: AI affected employment decisions in that employers, in some cases, cited increased investment in AI technologies as a reason for lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition.\n\nKey facts:\n1) Employers increased investment in AI technologies.\n2) This was cited as a reason for lowering head counts.\n3) Mechanisms: layoffs and attrition.\n\nThe system answer states that AI reduced firms’ need for labor, causing layoffs, attrition, early retirements, slower hiring, weaker demand for entry-level workers, etc. It explicitly mentions: \"more employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition, with contacts citing… in some cases, increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies.\" This directly matches and expands the ground truth. All core elements are present and accurate: AI investment/adoption → reduced labor needs → layoffs and attrition / lowered headcount. Extra detail is consistent with the source and not contradictory.\n\nTherefore the answer is fully consistent and more detailed than the expected answer, with no errors.\n",

      "expected_answer": "In the four districts where economic activity declined (New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco): New York saw manufacturing hold steady after a summer uptick; Minneapolis reported manufacturing was flat; Kansas City saw manufacturing output growth moderate; and San Francisco reported manufacturing activity remained stable. Overall, manufacturing in declining districts was flat to slightly moderating.",
      "system_answer": "In districts where overall economic activity declined or softened, manufacturing typically *faced significant headwinds*, but the outcomes were mixed rather than uniformly negative.\n\nCause → effect nationally\n- The Beige Book’s National Summary reports that **“manufacturing activity varied by District”** and that **“most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand.”** [BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary > Overall Economic Activity]\n  - This was caused by **higher tariffs**, which raised input costs and complicated pricing, and by **waning overall demand**, which reduced orders.\n  - As a result, **manufacturers in many districts experienced pressure on sales, margins, and production plans**, even where overall district activity was only flat or slightly down.\n\nDistricts where overall activity declined and implications for manufacturing\n- The Beige Book notes that economic activity **declined slightly** in several districts:\n  - **Kansas City (Tenth District)**: overall economic activity “fell slightly.” [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **New York (Second District)**: activity “continued to decline slightly.” [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Minneapolis (Ninth District)**: activity was “slightly down” / “contracted slightly.” [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **San Francisco (Twelfth District)**: activity “edged down slightly.” [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n  For these districts specifically, the supplied excerpts do not detail their manufacturing sectors, but the **national pattern** still clarifies the causal channel:\n  - Because **overall district demand softened**, and because **tariffs raised costs and uncertainty**, manufacturers in these districts **faced challenging conditions**.\n  - As a result, manufacturing in such declining-activity districts was generally **pressured by weaker orders and cost uncertainty**, even though the Beige Book evidence here does not state, district by district, that manufacturing output itself fell.\n\nConcrete examples of how weak/soft overall conditions affected manufacturing\n- **Richmond (Fifth District)** – example where manufacturing *did* decline despite modest overall growth:\n  - Overall: “continued to grow modestly.” [Richmond > Summary of Economic Activity]\n  - Manufacturing: “**Manufacturing activity in the Fifth District declined slightly** in the recent reporting period.” [Richmond > Manufacturing]\n    - This was caused by **reduced demand** and **greater price sensitivity among customers**; a furniture manufacturer reported **“decreased demand coupled with tariffs increasing their prices.”** [Richmond > Manufacturing]\n    - As a result, firms **adjusted product offerings and scaled back activity**, showing how weaker demand plus tariffs translated directly into a modest manufacturing decline.\n\n- **National tariff/demand channel applied to soft/declining districts**:\n  - The National Summary states that **“most reports”** linked manufacturing challenges to **higher tariffs and waning demand**. [National Summary > Overall Economic Activity]\n  - This was caused by: \n    - Tariffs raising input costs and complicating sourcing/pricing (reported in Richmond, Boston, Kansas City, and Philadelphia).\n    - Slower overall spending and investment, which reduced orders.\n  - As a result, in districts where **overall activity declined or was flat**, manufacturers were more likely to:\n    - Experience **weaker new orders** and **tighter margins**.\n    - Report **operational challenges** and hesitancy to expand capacity.\n\nCountervailing cases: manufacturing could still grow despite broader softness\nThe data also show that a decline or softness in overall activity **did not automatically cause manufacturing to contract** everywhere:\n\n- **Kansas City (Tenth District)** – overall activity fell slightly, but:\n  - Manufacturing: “**Manufacturing activity increased slightly over the past few weeks, driven by clearer market expectations from tariffs.**” [Kansas City > Manufacturing and Other Business Activity]\n  - This was caused by **greater clarity around tariff policy**, which reduced uncertainty and helped firms adjust.\n  - As a result, **manufacturing expanded slightly** even though the district’s overall economic activity “fell slightly.”\n\n- **Boston (First District)** – facing tariff and uncertainty headwinds, yet:\n  - Manufacturing: “**Manufacturing sales rose modestly since the last report, on average**,” even as firms cited “tariffs, inflation, and uncertainty” as headwinds. [Boston > Manufacturing and Related Services]\n  - This was caused by firms’ ability to **maintain or find demand** despite cost and policy pressures.\n  - As a result, manufacturing **rose modestly**, contradicting a simple “soft economy → falling manufacturing” rule.\n\n- **Philadelphia (Third District)** – modest overall activity, stronger manufacturing:\n  - Overall: “Business activity increased slightly.” [National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Philadelphia]\n  - Manufacturing: “**Activity increased slightly for nonmanufacturers and moderately for manufacturers.**” [National Summary > Highlights > Philadelphia]\n    - Detailed survey: “Total production increased…for 46 percent of firms… A few firms reported increased activity from an uptick in **tariff-related onshoring**.” [Philadelphia > Manufacturing]\n  - This was caused by some **production being reshored** in response to tariffs, which boosted local manufacturing demand.\n  - As a result, **manufacturing grew moderately**, even though overall business activity increased only slightly.\n\nPutting it together causally\n- **Where overall economic activity declined or softened**, manufacturers:\n  - Faced **weaker demand** and **higher costs/uncertainty from tariffs**, as reported in the national summary and multiple districts.\n  - As a result, in many places manufacturing **either slowed or came under pressure**, as seen clearly in Richmond and echoed in national comments about “challenging conditions.”\n\n- However, **the same causes (tariffs and shifting demand) sometimes produced the opposite effect** in particular districts:\n  - In **Kansas City** and **Philadelphia**, *clarity* about tariffs or **onshoring prompted by tariffs** caused **an increase in manufacturing activity**, even as overall or nonmanufacturing activity was softer.\n\nSo, in districts where economic activity declined, manufacturing generally **faced headwinds due to weaker demand and tariff-related uncertainty**, often leading to slower or slightly declining activity. As a result of specific local factors—like clearer tariff expectations or tariff-driven onshoring—some of these districts nonetheless saw **slight increases in manufacturing**, showing that the causal link from weaker overall activity to weaker manufacturing was strong but not universal.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n- Focus is specifically on the four districts where economic activity declined: New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco.\n- For each: \n  - New York: manufacturing held steady after a summer uptick.\n  - Minneapolis: manufacturing was flat.\n  - Kansas City: manufacturing output growth moderated (i.e., slowed, not increased).\n  - San Francisco: manufacturing activity remained stable.\n- Overall characterization: in declining districts, manufacturing was flat to slightly moderating.\n\nComparison to system answer:\n- The system answer largely ignores the specific district-level manufacturing descriptions for New York, Minneapolis, and San Francisco; it explicitly says that for these districts “the supplied excerpts do not detail their manufacturing sectors,” instead inferring from a national pattern. That contradicts the ground truth, which clearly has specific information for each.\n- For Kansas City, the system answer explicitly states: “Manufacturing activity increased slightly over the past few weeks…” This directly contradicts the expected answer that Kansas City saw manufacturing output growth moderate (i.e., slow), not increase.\n- The system emphasizes national headwinds, tariffs, weaker demand, and offers several other district examples (Richmond, Boston, Philadelphia) that are not asked for and do not answer the specific question about the four declining districts.\n- The overall conclusion from the system: manufacturing “generally faced headwinds… often leading to slower or slightly declining activity,” with some slight increases in some districts. This does not clearly state that in the four declining-activity districts manufacturing was flat to slightly moderating; instead it mixes in contradictory claims (like Kansas City increasing) and generalizations.\n\nBecause there is a concrete factual error about Kansas City and the answer fails to provide the specific correct characterizations for the four named districts, the answer is not just incomplete; it is factually incorrect relative to the ground truth.\n",

(2) Philadelphia - manufacturers reported increased cost pressures from tariffs and some tariff-related onshoring, while contacts noted disruptions from immigration policies including vacated positions due to visa status changes and decline in foreign-born workers in construction. (3) Atlanta - concerns over tariffs remained prevalent among manufacturers, while immigration policy impacts were more material than previously reported in agriculture and hospitality sectors. (4) Chicago - manufacturing contacts attributed metals price increases to tariffs, while contacts noted fear of immigration enforcement was reducing labor availability and revoked visas created rehiring needs. (5) St. Louis - contacts reported managing tariffs as a cost factor, while immigration policies resulted in labor shortages with workers in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture not reporting to work due to fears of deportation. (6) San Francisco - higher import duties led to cost increases for raw materials and electronic components used in manufacturing, while contacts in construction and manufacturing noted difficulty finding entry-level workers attributed to reduced immigration.",
      "system_answer": "- Based on the provided evidence, there are **no districts** that are reported as mentioning **both**:\n  - tariff impacts on manufacturing **and**\n  - labor shortages attributed to immigration policies.\n\n  The districts are disjoint across the two topics:\n  - Tariff impacts on manufacturing: **Atlanta**, **Cleveland**\n  - Labor shortages from immigration policies: **San Francisco**, potential future issues noted in **Boston** (but not current shortages)\n\n  Therefore, **no overlapping district** can be identified from the given excerpts.",

      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth clearly states that six districts mentioned both tariff impacts on manufacturing and labor shortages from immigration policies: New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco. The system answer instead claims that there are no districts that mention both topics, and further proposes a different, incorrect set of districts for tariffs (Atlanta, Cleveland) and for immigration-related labor shortages (San Francisco, Boston). This directly contradicts the expected answer and omits all six correct overlapping districts. The response is not an abstention; it asserts a definite conclusion that is factually wrong relative to the ground truth. Therefore, the answer is incorrect.",

      "expected_answer": "Steel prices decreased in the Atlanta (Sixth) District and lumber prices decreased in the San Francisco (Twelfth) District. In both cases, waning demand in those markets pushed prices down. This occurred even as overall prices rose during the reporting period.",
      "system_answer": "By district, the materials that saw price decreases and the causes were:\n\n**Sixth District (Atlanta) – Steel**  \n- **Outcome (price decrease):** Prices for **steel** declined.  \n- **Cause:** This was caused by **waning/softer demand** for steel in the District. As demand weakened, firms had less pricing power and had to accept lower prices, so steel prices moved down as a result. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary > Prices]\n\n**Twelfth District (San Francisco) – Lumber**  \n- **Outcome (price decrease):** Prices for **lumber** declined.  \n- **Cause:** This was caused by **weakening demand** in lumber markets. As demand for lumber fell, suppliers reduced prices to clear inventories and maintain sales, and lumber prices declined as a result. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary > Prices]\n\n**Tenth District (Kansas City) – Construction materials (unspecified)**  \n- **Outcome (price decrease):** Prices for **construction materials** overall were reported to have declined. The specific materials within this category are not named in the available evidence.  \n- **Cause:** This was caused by **reduced sales and construction activity** in the District. As construction projects slowed and sales fell, demand for construction materials dropped, leading suppliers to lower prices as a result. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nAcross these Districts, the common causal pattern is:  \n- **Weaker demand (from softer market conditions, reduced construction activity, or lower sales)** → **less pricing power for suppliers** → **downward pressure on materials prices (steel, lumber, and broader construction materials)**.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Steel prices decreased in the Atlanta (Sixth) District.\n2) Lumber prices decreased in the San Francisco (Twelfth) District.\n3) In both cases, waning/weakening demand in those markets caused the price decreases.\n4) This happened even as overall prices rose during the reporting period.\n\nCompare to system answer:\n- It correctly states that steel prices declined in the Sixth District and attributes this to waning/softer demand. This matches facts 1 and 3.\n- It correctly states that lumber prices declined in the Twelfth District and attributes this to weakening demand. This matches facts 2 and 3.\n- It then adds an additional district (Tenth, Kansas City) and claims there were declines in construction materials prices there, with causes described. That is extra information not in the expected answer. We are not told in the task whether this is true or false relative to the source; as the judge we only compare to the expected answer. However, the instructions say the system should not make up facts not supported by the context. The expected answer explicitly lists only two districts/materials. The system’s confident inclusion of a third district and category contradicts the expected answer’s implication that only those two are relevant, and there is no support given in the ground truth for that third case. Under our rubric, that counts as hallucinated/incorrect information.\n- The system also omits the point that these decreases occurred even as overall prices rose during the reporting period (fact 4). That makes the answer incomplete with respect to the expected answer.\n\nBecause the answer includes at least one extra asserted fact (about the Tenth District) that is not supported by the expected answer and may contradict the intended scope, this falls under \"incorrect\" rather than merely incomplete. The parts about the Sixth and Twelfth districts are correct, but the hallucinated third case makes the overall answer incorrect by the given criteria.",

      "question": "How did consumer spending patterns differ between income groups, and what drove those differences?",
      "expected_answer": "Higher-income individuals maintained strong spending on luxury travel and accommodation. Lower- and middle-income households sought discounts and promotions due to rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. This bifurcation was driven by rising prices eroding purchasing power for lower/middle-income groups while higher-income groups remained insulated.",
      "system_answer": "Consumer spending patterns differed sharply by income group because each group faced different constraints and incentives. These underlying factors then produced distinct spending outcomes.\n\n1. Differences in income and financial cushion → Different ability to maintain discretionary spending\n- Mid- to upper-income households had more disposable income and financial buffers. This was caused by higher earnings and greater savings, which made them less sensitive to price increases and income fluctuations. \n  - As a result, they remained “resilient” spenders and largely drove the modest gains in overall consumer spending. They continued to spend on discretionary categories such as travel, events, luxury services, apparel, cosmetics, and fragrances. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- In contrast, low- and many middle-income households operated with tighter budgets and less cushion. This was caused by lower incomes and more exposure to cost-of-living pressures, leaving less room for nonessential purchases.\n  - As a result, they had to cut back more on discretionary items like autos, sporting goods, and discretionary travel, contributing to what some contacts called a “middle-class recession.” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. Differences in price sensitivity → Shifts toward discounts vs. continued full-price spending\n- Lower-income and many middle-income consumers were highly price sensitive. This was caused by the need to stretch limited budgets amid elevated prices.\n  - As a result, they increasingly timed purchases around sales and markdowns, shifted toward deals and discounted goods, and made their consumption more volatile and opportunistic rather than steady. They also showed rising use of food pantries to meet basic needs. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Mid- to upper-income households were less price sensitive because their higher incomes allowed them to absorb price increases without fundamentally changing their lifestyle.\n  - As a result, they continued to purchase higher-end retail and luxury services and sustained demand for travel and events, even at higher price points. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n3. Differences in credit use and financial stress → Diverging reliance on borrowing\n- Lower- and middle-income consumers faced more financial stress as disposable incomes came under pressure. This was caused by limited savings, rising living costs, and weaker cash flow.\n  - As a result, they relied more heavily on credit cards and “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) services to sustain their spending, including for some basics. This contributed to rising credit card delinquencies and heightened concern by banks about these customers. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Banks expected customers in lower-income brackets and in discretionary-spending industries to experience further strain. This was caused by declining disposable incomes and tighter household budgets.\n  - As a result, these groups became more constrained in their ability to spend, especially on non-essentials, reinforcing cutbacks in categories like travel and certain goods. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Mid- to upper-income households, by contrast, did not need to lean as heavily on credit just to maintain current consumption levels.\n  - As a result, their spending on discretionary categories was more stable and less tied to short-term credit products, further differentiating their patterns from those of lower-income groups. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n4. Segment-specific outcomes in key spending categories\n- Travel, events, and hospitality:\n  - Upper-income households and corporate clients continued to spend on travel, events, and luxury services. This was caused by their stronger financial position and lower sensitivity to higher prices. \n    - As a result, demand in these categories remained relatively robust among higher earners. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Middle-income consumers showed weaker demand for travel and select-service hotels. This was caused by tighter budgets and increased financial stress.\n    - As a result, some local observers characterized conditions as a “middle-class recession,” with middle-income travelers pulling back more than wealthier travelers. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- Goods and retail:\n  - Lower-income consumers shifted toward discounted goods and carefully timed purchases. This was caused by heightened price sensitivity and the need to prioritize essentials.\n    - As a result, their spending became more concentrated in promotions and value-oriented retail formats, with cutbacks in categories like autos and sporting goods. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Mid- to upper-income consumers continued to support higher-end retail and luxury products. This was caused by their ability to absorb elevated prices.\n    - As a result, they provided much of the growth in segments like apparel, cosmetics, fragrances, and other discretionary retail. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nOverall cause–effect chain:\n- Differences in income levels and financial cushions caused differences in price sensitivity and reliance on credit.\n- These differences in price sensitivity and credit use then caused divergent spending behaviors: higher-income households sustained or increased discretionary and luxury spending, while lower- and middle-income households shifted toward discounts, essential goods, and greater borrowing, often cutting back on travel and big-ticket or discretionary items.\n- As a result, aggregate consumer spending growth was modest but increasingly driven by mid- to upper-income households, even as lower- and middle-income groups experienced more acute financial strain and pulled back, leading some observers to describe conditions as a “middle-class recession.” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Higher-income individuals maintained strong spending on luxury travel and accommodation.\n2) Lower- and middle-income households sought discounts and promotions.\n3) This divergence was driven by rising prices eroding purchasing power for lower/middle-income groups.\n4) Higher-income groups were relatively insulated from those pressures.\n\nCheck against system answer:\n- The system clearly states that mid- to upper-income households continued discretionary spending, including travel, events, luxury services, higher-end retail, etc. This aligns with “maintained strong spending on luxury travel and accommodation.”\n- It says low- and many middle-income households cut back on discretionary items, were highly price sensitive, and “increasingly timed purchases around sales and markdowns, shifted toward deals and discounted goods.” This matches “sought discounts and promotions.”\n- It attributes the divergence to differences in income/financial cushions, heightened price sensitivity among lower/middle income consumers, rising living costs, and cost-of-living pressures, which is consistent with “rising prices eroding purchasing power for lower/middle-income groups.”\n- It emphasizes that mid- to upper-income households had more disposable income, were less sensitive to price increases, and could absorb higher prices without major lifestyle changes, which corresponds to them being “insulated.”\n- No factual contradictions with the expected answer; the system answer is more detailed but consistent with it.\n\nAll key elements are present and correctly explained, and the added detail is compatible with the ground truth.\n\nVerdict: correct.",

      "question": "What is the relationship between AI investment and employment trends reported in the Beige Book?",
      "expected_answer": "Some employers cited increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies as one of the reasons for lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. This occurred alongside other factors like weaker demand and elevated economic uncertainty. Overall employment levels were largely stable, but demand for labor was generally muted, with more employers reporting layoffs and attrition.",
      "system_answer": "In the Beige Book, AI investment is described as a contributing cause of softer employment trends, mainly through labor substitution and dampened hiring needs.\n\n1. AI investment causing headcount reductions\n- The National Summary notes that some employers **lowered head counts through layoffs and attrition** and explicitly **cited increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies as one reason** alongside weaker demand and uncertainty. This was caused by firms using AI tools to perform tasks that previously required human workers, which reduced the number of employees needed. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- As a result, overall labor demand eased in some sectors, and reported employment trends were flat to slightly softening rather than expanding.\n\n2. AI substituting for entry-level and routine work\n- In the San Francisco District, **“employment reductions were coupled with investment in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly for positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees.”** This was caused by firms deploying AI systems to handle routine, lower-skill tasks that entry-level workers had done. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- As a result, staff cuts were concentrated among less-experienced or entry-level roles, and firms anticipated “a smaller need for entry-level folks,” echoing comments from Minneapolis where AI tools complete such work faster. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n3. AI adoption dampening future labor demand\n- The Minneapolis District reports that **artificial intelligence was expected to have a slight dampening effect on future labor demand**, with firms anticipating fewer hires because AI can handle some of the work. This expectation was caused by observed productivity gains from AI tools that allow existing staff to do more. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- The Atlanta District similarly notes that firms **expect further head count cuts “based on early Generative AI implementation results.”** This was caused by early evidence that generative AI reduces the need for certain roles or hours. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- As a result, forward-looking employment plans in these Districts are more cautious, with some firms planning staff reductions instead of expansion.\n\n4. AI-enabled layoffs in professional services\n- In the Kansas City District, **“larger layoffs” at some professional services companies were “associated with the adoption and implementation of AI capabilities that reduced overall labor needs.”** This was caused by AI tools taking over analytical, administrative, or routine professional tasks, so firms could operate with fewer employees. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- As a result, professional services—normally a white‑collar growth area—saw notable job cuts linked specifically to AI adoption, contributing to the Beige Book’s picture of a softening labor market.\n\n5. Mixed effects: substitution in some areas, investment and hiring in others\n- While many reports tie AI investment to job cuts, the Beige Book also notes that AI is part of **broader business and technology investment**. In Boston, software and IT services contacts described strong demand supported by **“spillover IT investments related to AI adoption.”** This was caused by firms needing new software, infrastructure, and services to implement AI. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- As a result, even as AI reduces labor needs in some occupations, it stimulates demand and modest hiring in IT and related sectors, creating an uneven pattern across industries.\n\n6. Overall causal relationship described in the Beige Book\n- The Beige Book portrays AI investment as both a **response to** and a **driver of** changing employment trends:\n  - Weaker demand and uncertainty led firms to seek efficiency gains; this was partly achieved through **increased investment in AI**, which in turn **caused** reductions in headcounts, especially in routine and entry-level roles.\n  - As AI tools were implemented and proved effective, firms revised their staffing plans, **expecting lower future labor demand** and planning further cuts or restrained hiring.\n\nIn sum, the Beige Book links AI investment causally to softer employment trends by showing that AI adoption has **reduced overall labor needs, prompted layoffs and attrition, and dampened future hiring plans**, particularly for entry-level and routine positions, while simultaneously driving some offsetting investment and hiring in IT-related sectors.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n- Some employers explicitly cited increased investment in AI technologies as a reason for lowering head counts via layoffs and attrition.\n- This AI-related effect occurred alongside other factors like weaker demand and elevated uncertainty.\n- Overall employment levels were largely stable, but labor demand was muted.\n- More employers reported layoffs and attrition.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer explicitly states that some employers lowered head counts through layoffs and attrition and cited increased AI investment as one reason, alongside weaker demand and uncertainty. This matches the core relationship described in the ground truth.\n- It correctly frames AI investment as contributing to softer employment trends via headcount reductions and dampened hiring needs, consistent with the expected answer’s “muted” labor demand and increased layoffs/attrition.\n- While the system answer adds a lot of extra detail (district-level examples, mechanisms like substitution of entry‑level work, mixed effects, etc.) that go beyond the ground truth, these additions are consistent with and do not contradict the expected answer.\n- The overall picture the system gives—AI investment linked causally to reduced labor needs, layoffs/attrition, and softer hiring—is fully aligned with the expected summary that employment levels are largely stable but with muted demand and more layoffs/attrition.\n- No factual contradictions with the expected answer are present; the key points are all covered and elaborated.\n\nTherefore the system answer is complete and consistent with the expected answer, with additional but non‑conflicting details.\n",

      "question": "Compare the economic outlook between districts that saw growth versus those that saw decline.",
      "expected_answer": "Districts with growth (Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond) had mixed-to-cautiously-optimistic outlooks: Boston was neutral to cautiously optimistic with mostly downside risks; Philadelphia expected modest growth but noted heightened uncertainty. Districts with decline (New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco) had varied outlooks: New York businesses did not expect activity to increase much; Kansas City was broadly optimistic for 2026 despite recent declines; Minneapolis saw contraction across most sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Below is a side‑by‑side comparison of the economic outlook in districts that saw growth versus those that saw decline/softening, using only what is supported in the provided Beige Book excerpts.\n\n---\n## 1. Overall activity and trajectory\n\n**Growth / flat districts**  \n- Nationally, **three Districts** reported **slight to modest growth** and **five** reported **no change** in activity. [National Summary – Overall Economic Activity]\n- **Philadelphia**: “**Business activity increased slightly**” in the period. [Highlights – Philadelphia]\n- **Boston**: At least in manufacturing, “**manufacturing sales rose modestly** since the last report.” [Boston – Manufacturing and Related Services]\n- For other growth/flat districts, the excerpts do not name them, so they cannot be specified.\n\n**Decline / softening districts**  \n- Nationally, **four Districts** reported a **slight softening** of activity. [National Summary – Overall Economic Activity]\n- **New York (Second District)**: Economic activity “**continued to decline slightly**,” and businesses “did not expect much of an increase in activity in the months ahead.” [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Kansas City (Tenth District)**: “**Economic activity in the Tenth District fell slightly**, with softening activity reported across several sectors.” [Kansas City – Summary of Economic Activity]\n- **San Francisco (Twelfth District)**: Economic activity “**edged down slightly**,” and “contacts’ economic outlook **weakened somewhat** relative to the prior reporting period.” [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n---\n## 2. Short‑term outlook (next 6–12 months)\n\n**Growth / flat districts**  \n- **Philadelphia**: Firms “**expect modest growth over the next six months**, but heightened economic uncertainty remains.” This is a **cautiously optimistic** near‑term outlook. [Highlights – Philadelphia]\n- **Boston**: Contacts were “**mostly optimistic about their prospects through the end of the year**,” though with significant uncertainty and a weaker view for 2026. [Boston – Manufacturing and Related Services]\n- Nationally, “sentiment reportedly **improved in a few Districts**, with some contacts expecting an **uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months**,” but the specific districts are not named. [National Summary – Overall Economic Activity]\n\n**Decline / softening districts**  \n- **New York**: Businesses “**did not expect much of an increase in activity in the months ahead**,” implying a **muted or flat near‑term outlook** after a slight decline. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Kansas City**: Despite the recent decline, “the majority of contacts … expect their **sales and employment levels to be higher at the end of 2026** than in 2025,” indicating **weak current conditions but mild medium‑term optimism**, rather than clear near‑term improvement. [Kansas City – Summary of Economic Activity]\n- **San Francisco**: The outlook “**weakened somewhat** relative to the prior reporting period,” so current declines are matched by a **softening forward view**, rather than expectations of an imminent rebound. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n---\n## 3. Labor markets and employment expectations\n\n**Growth / flat districts**  \n- **Philadelphia**: “Employment levels **increased slightly**,” with wages rising at “**modest pre‑pandemic rates**.” This supports a picture of **gradual labor market improvement** alongside slight growth. [Highlights – Philadelphia]\n- **Boston**: The excerpt focuses on manufacturing; it does not give an explicit district‑wide employment trend, but overall tone is of **stable to modestly improving** conditions with elevated uncertainty. [Boston – Manufacturing and Related Services]\n\n**Decline / softening districts**  \n- **Kansas City**: “Employment levels **fell slightly** overall,” mirroring the slight decline in activity. Yet, most contacts expect **higher employment by end‑2026**, indicating current softness but **longer‑term hiring intentions**. [Kansas City – Summary of Economic Activity]\n- **New York** and **San Francisco**: The provided excerpt for each focuses on overall activity and outlook; detailed employment descriptions are not included in the text you supplied, so we cannot specify their labor market path beyond noting their general **slight decline in activity**.\n\n---\n## 4. Credit conditions and financial stress\n\n**Growth / flat districts**  \n- The provided excerpts for **Philadelphia** and **Boston** do not highlight notable deterioration in loan portfolios. The national summary notes some sectoral weakness in **financial services**, but does not tie it by name to these districts in the shared text. [National Summary – Overall Economic Activity]\n\n**Decline / softening districts**  \n- **Kansas City**: “Bankers noted **consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately**.” This is explicit evidence of **rising financial stress** among households or borrowers in a district where overall activity and employment have fallen slightly. [Kansas City – Summary of Economic Activity]\n- For **New York** and **San Francisco**, the excerpts you provided do not mention loan quality or credit conditions, so we cannot compare further on this dimension from the available text.\n\n---\n## 5. Prices, inflation, and pricing power\n\n**Growth / flat districts**  \n- **Philadelphia**: “Prices **continued to rise moderately**,” consistent with a moderate inflation environment in a district experiencing slight growth and modest wage increases. [Highlights – Philadelphia]\n- **Boston**: Inflation is described as a **headwind**: the 2026 outlook was “slightly weaker on balance, with headwinds related to **tariffs, inflation, and uncertainty**.” This suggests firms **face cost and pricing challenges** even where activity has been modestly positive. [Boston – Manufacturing and Related Services]\n\n**Decline / softening districts**  \n- **Kansas City**: “Prices rose at a **moderate** pace, and contacts reported they anticipate **raising selling prices in 2026 at a slightly faster pace** than this year.” Despite current softness, firms still expect to exercise **pricing power**, reflecting ongoing inflation pressures even in a weak activity environment. [Kansas City – Summary of Economic Activity]\n- For **New York** and **San Francisco**, the excerpts do not provide detail on prices or inflation, so no direct contrast can be drawn from the supplied text.\n\n---\n## 6. Role of uncertainty, policy, and external headwinds\n\n**Growth / flat districts**  \n- **Philadelphia**: Even with slight growth, “**heightened economic uncertainty remains**,” tempering firms’ expectations for modest expansion. [Highlights – Philadelphia]\n- **Boston**: “Uncertainty remained **elevated**, presenting challenges for some in making pricing, production, and/or advertising plans.” The 2026 outlook is weaker due to “**tariffs, inflation, and uncertainty**,” identifying **policy (tariffs)** and inflation as key headwinds in a district with modest recent gains. [Boston – Manufacturing and Related Services]\n- **Dallas (CRE sector)**: While not classified district‑wide here, its construction and real estate contacts reported “outlooks remained **cautious**” and firms signed short‑term leases because of “**heightened uncertainty**,” underscoring that even where some sectors improve, **uncertainty constrains longer‑term commitments**. [Dallas – Construction and Real Estate]\n\n**Decline / softening districts**  \n- **Kansas City**: Businesses noted that strategic pricing behavior and “different exposure to **technology and policy shocks**” are affecting market shares. This indicates **policy shocks are an important risk factor** in a district already seeing activity and employment fall slightly. [Kansas City – Summary of Economic Activity]\n- **San Francisco**: The statement that the “economic outlook **weakened somewhat**” indicates rising caution or pessimism, though specific drivers (policy, inflation, etc.) are not detailed in the excerpt. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Nationally, “many [districts] continued to expect **elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity**,” a theme clearly reflected in both growth districts (Boston, Philadelphia) and softening districts (Kansas City, and sectors like Dallas CRE), but the national summary does not attach this phrase to specific named districts. [National Summary – Overall Economic Activity]\n\n---\n## 7. Sectoral patterns\n\n**Growth / flat districts**  \n- **Boston**: Evidence of growth is **sectoral**: “Manufacturing sales rose modestly,” while capital expenditures were **unchanged**, pointing to **incremental gains rather than broad‑based expansion**. [Boston – Manufacturing and Related Services]\n- **Philadelphia**: Both sides of the economy improved: “Activity **increased slightly for nonmanufacturers and moderately for manufacturers**,” indicating **balanced, though modest, growth** across sectors. [Highlights – Philadelphia]\n\n**Decline / softening districts**  \n- **Kansas City**: The district reports softening “across several sectors,” though the excerpt does not enumerate them; in addition, consumer loan portfolios deteriorated, highlighting stress in **household credit** alongside broader sectoral softness. [Kansas City – Summary of Economic Activity]\n- **San Francisco**: Activity “**edged down slightly**,” but the short excerpt does not specify which sectors drove the decline; it does note that the **overall outlook weakened**, implying a broader concern. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Nationally, the summary notes that “activity in **agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down** among reporting Districts,” but does not tie specific sectors to specific named districts in the text you provided. [National Summary – Overall Economic Activity]\n\n---\n## 8. Net characterization: Growth versus decline districts\n\n**Growth / flat districts (e.g., Philadelphia, Boston)**  \n- **Current conditions**: Slight increases in overall activity (Philadelphia) or modest sectoral gains (Boston manufacturing), with broadly stable or slightly improving labor markets.\n- **Outlook**: Cautiously **positive near term** (modest growth expected over the next six months or through year‑end), but **tempered by elevated uncertainty**, inflation, and policy‑related headwinds (tariffs).\n- **Inflation and pricing**: Prices generally rising at a **moderate** pace; inflation is already seen as a **headwind for future growth**.\n- **Risk profile**: More about **uncertainty and policy/inflation headwinds** constraining an otherwise modest expansion, rather than acute financial stress.\n\n**Decline / softening districts (New York, Kansas City, San Francisco)**  \n- **Current conditions**: Activity has **fallen slightly** or “edged down,” and in at least one case (Kansas City) **employment has also fallen slightly**.\n- **Outlook**: Mixed but generally weaker:\n  - New York expects **little improvement** in the months ahead.\n  - Kansas City and its contacts, despite current declines, expect **higher sales and employment by 2026**, implying **longer‑term guarded optimism** but no strong near‑term rebound signal.\n  - San Francisco’s outlook has **weakened** relative to the prior report.\n- **Financial stress**: Kansas City reports **moderate deterioration in consumer loan portfolios**, a sign of rising strain not seen in the growth‑district excerpts.\n- **Inflation and pricing**: Even in decline, Kansas City expects to **raise prices faster in 2026**, suggesting that **inflationary pressures coexist with weak real activity**.\n- **Risk profile**: Combination of **current softness, some financial deterioration (Kansas City), and weakened sentiment**, with policy and technology shocks cited as important drivers in at least one declining district.\n\n---\n**Information gaps**\n- The national summary counts (3 growth, 5 no change, 4 softening) are clear, but the **full lists of which specific districts** fall in each category are **not provided** in the excerpts.\n- For **New York** and **San Francisco**, we have overall decline and weaker outlooks but **little detail on employment, loan quality, or sectoral breakdown** in the supplied text.\n- For **Dallas**, we only have a **sectoral** (construction/real estate) snapshot showing improvement with uncertainty; its **overall district classification** (growth, flat, or softening) is not established in the excerpts.\n\nWithin these limits, the pattern is: growth districts report **slight, broadly based gains with cautious optimism and strong emphasis on uncertainty and inflation headwinds**, whereas decline districts face **current softening, some financial strain and weaker or more guarded outlooks**, even as a few (like Kansas City) still anticipate **medium‑term improvement** despite present declines.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key points in the expected answer:\n- Growth districts: Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond.\n  - Boston: neutral to cautiously optimistic, with mostly downside risks.\n  - Philadelphia: modest growth expected but heightened uncertainty.\n- Decline districts: New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco.\n  - New York: businesses do not expect activity to increase much.\n  - Kansas City: recent declines but broadly optimistic for 2026.\n  - Minneapolis: contraction across most sectors.\n- Overall comparison: growth districts have mixed-to-cautiously-optimistic outlooks; decline districts have varied outlooks with generally weaker expectations.\n\nSystem answer vs. these points:\n- Correctly characterizes **Philadelphia** as expecting modest growth with heightened uncertainty (cautiously optimistic), matching the ground truth.\n- Correctly captures **Boston** as mostly optimistic near term but with uncertainty and weaker medium-term outlook; this is compatible with “neutral to cautiously optimistic with mostly downside risks.”\n- Correctly describes **New York** as having slightly declining activity and not expecting much increase ahead.\n- Correctly describes **Kansas City** as having slight current decline but expecting higher sales and employment by 2026 (medium‑term optimism despite current weakness), consistent with the expected answer.\n- Correctly notes **San Francisco** activity edged down and outlook weakened somewhat.\n- It gives an overall comparison where growth districts are cautiously positive with uncertainty, and decline districts show current softness, weaker outlooks, and some medium‑term optimism (Kansas City) or muted expectations (New York, San Francisco), which aligns with the expected comparative framing.\n\nHowever, there are gaps and deviations:\n- The expected answer explicitly lists **Richmond** as a growth district; the system answer does not mention Richmond at all.\n- The expected answer lists **Minneapolis** as a decline district with contraction across most sectors; the system answer does not mention Minneapolis at all.\n- The system introduces a lot of extra structure (labor markets, credit, prices, etc.). While this is not inherently wrong, it goes beyond the simple comparative outlook requested, but does not contradict the expected answer.\n- Where the system makes claims, they are consistent with the kind of outlook characterization in the ground truth; no clear factual contradictions relative to the expected answer are evident.\n\nBecause two key districts (Richmond and Minneapolis) and their outlook characterizations are missing, but the districts and outlooks that are discussed are characterized consistently with the expected answer, the result is accurate but incomplete rather than wrong or misleading.\n\nThus the best label is PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

      "question": "How did trade-related concerns affect the agriculture sector across different districts?",
      "expected_answer": "In the Minneapolis District, agricultural contacts were specifically concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases, representing a direct trade policy impact. In the St. Louis District, agriculture conditions were strained and further deteriorated, with the overall pessimistic outlook. Across reporting districts, activity in agriculture was generally down, with trade uncertainty adding to sector challenges.",
      "system_answer": "Across districts, trade-related concerns primarily affected agriculture by reducing export demand—especially from China—lowering prices for export-oriented crops, and increasing input costs. This combination strained farm incomes and investment plans, even though production volumes often remained strong.\n\nBelow is the cause‑and‑effect chain by district and issue.\n\n1. San Francisco (Twelfth District)\n- Cause: Trade policy adjustments and ongoing negotiations with China reduced foreign demand for U.S. agricultural products, particularly from Chinese buyers. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Effect: This fall in external demand depressed commodity prices in the district, even though yields were not described as weak.\n- Further Effect: Lower prices, combined with already low commodity price levels and higher production costs, strained producers’ finances.\n- As a result: Producers curtailed or delayed planned investment for the next season and agricultural and resource-related conditions in the district “weakened slightly.” [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. Minneapolis (Ninth District)\n- Cause: China’s decision not to order U.S. soybeans, driven by trade policy tensions and uncertainty, sharply reduced a major export outlet for district soybean producers. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Effect: The loss of this key export market pushed soybean prices lower.\n- Further Effect: With low crop prices and high expenses, farm incomes were squeezed.\n- As a result: Contacts in the district were “extremely concerned” about trade-related risks to soybean producers, and overall agricultural conditions weakened even though crop production itself remained strong. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n3. Chicago (Seventh District)\n- Cause: The absence of new-crop exports to China—again tied to trade policy frictions—reduced demand for regional soybeans. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Effect: This contributed to lower soybean prices in the district.\n- As a result: Net farm income came under pressure for soybean and other export-oriented crop producers, despite strong or record levels of corn and soybean production. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n4. Atlanta (Sixth District)\n- Export-side effects:\n  - Cause: Trade policy volatility and concerns about export markets led foreign buyers to seek lower-priced alternatives to U.S. products. Chinese demand for several crops shifted toward Brazil. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Effect: Overseas sales of U.S. rice declined as buyers turned to cheaper suppliers, and markets for soybeans, wheat, and corn remained depressed due to weaker Chinese demand.\n  - As a result: Income for producers of these export-oriented crops weakened, with exports underperforming even where domestic production capacity was not the immediate constraint.\n\n- Domestic-demand offset:\n  - Cause: Strong domestic demand for certain food and livestock products (such as beef, poultry, peanuts, tobacco, and food-service-related dairy) was not as directly dependent on the affected export channels. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Effect: Robust internal demand helped support prices and revenue for producers in these segments.\n  - As a result: While crop producers tied to depressed export markets saw income pressure, many livestock and specialty producers in the district maintained or improved farm income, partly offsetting trade-related weakness in other parts of the sector. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n5. Cross-district cost effects (imports and tariffs)\n- Cause: Tariff-related increases in the cost of imported inputs (such as certain machinery, equipment, or agrochemicals) raised production expenses across many districts. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Effect: Higher input costs squeezed margins because producers often could not fully pass these cost increases on to buyers, especially when selling into already-depressed global markets.\n- As a result: Even where output prices or domestic demand were relatively stable, farm profitability was eroded by rising costs, compounding the income effects of weaker export demand.\n\n6. Overall cause–effect pattern across districts\n- Cause (core trade-related issues):\n  - Trade policy uncertainty and negotiations, particularly with China.\n  - Direct decisions by China to reduce or halt purchases of specific U.S. commodities (notably soybeans).\n  - Global buyers’ shifts toward alternative suppliers (e.g., Brazil) and toward lower-priced sources.\n  - Tariff-driven increases in the cost of imported farm inputs.\n\n- Effects on agriculture:\n  - Depressed export demand for key crops (soybeans, wheat, corn, rice) in the San Francisco, Minneapolis, Chicago, and Atlanta Districts.\n  - Lower commodity prices for these export-oriented crops, especially soybeans, which weighed on net farm income. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Financial strain and heightened concern among producers, leading to cutbacks or delays in planned agricultural investment (notably in the San Francisco District).\n  - Weakened overall agricultural conditions in the most trade-exposed districts, even as production volumes remained strong or at record levels.\n  - Partial offset in some districts (e.g., Atlanta) where strong domestic demand for livestock and specialty products supported income in less export-dependent segments.\n\nIn sum, trade-related concerns did not substantially reduce current-year production volumes but caused weaker agricultural conditions across several districts by reducing export demand, depressing prices for key crops, and raising input costs. As a result, farm incomes and investment plans were negatively affected, especially in districts heavily exposed to Chinese and other foreign markets.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) In the Minneapolis District, agricultural contacts were specifically concerned about China’s elimination of soybean purchases – a direct trade policy impact.\n2) In the St. Louis District, agriculture conditions were strained and further deteriorated, with an overall pessimistic outlook.\n3) Across reporting districts, agricultural activity was generally down, with trade uncertainty adding to sector challenges.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer does capture the Minneapolis point accurately: it notes “China’s decision not to order U.S. soybeans” for the Minneapolis District, the resulting price drops, squeezed farm incomes, and that contacts were extremely concerned. This aligns with key fact (1).\n- However, St. Louis (Eighth District) is not mentioned at all in the system answer, so key fact (2) is missing.\n- The system answer does convey a broad, cross‑district pattern: export demand down (especially to China), lower prices, higher costs, strained incomes and weaker agricultural conditions, which is compatible with key fact (3) about activity being generally down and trade uncertainty adding challenges.\n- There are no clear factual contradictions with the expected answer; the answer is just more elaborate and covers different districts (San Francisco, Chicago, Atlanta) and cross‑district effects.\n\nBecause one major expected element (St. Louis conditions and pessimistic outlook) is absent, while the Minneapolis and general cross‑district impact are correctly covered and nothing is clearly wrong, the answer is incomplete but not misleading.",

      "question": "How did federal policy changes affect nonprofits across multiple districts?",
      "expected_answer": "In the New York District, nonprofits faced challenges due to unpredictable funding and reduction in federal benefit programs, with a community health-care center reporting financial distress among Medicaid patients. In the Cleveland District, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to uncertainty around federal grants. In the Boston District, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health-care sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Federal policy changes affected nonprofits across districts mainly by (1) changing the flow of federal dollars (benefits and grants) and (2) altering clients’ financial security. These forces then cascaded into concrete operational and service‑delivery impacts for nonprofits.\n\nBelow is the cause‑and‑effect chain, by mechanism and by district.\n\n1. Cuts or planned cuts to federal benefit programs → Greater client need → More pressure on nonprofit services\n\n- Boston (First District)\n  - Cause: Community contacts pointed to planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid as “significant looming risks” for low‑ and moderate‑income households, occurring alongside higher consumer prices [BeigeBook_20251015, Boston, Community Perspectives].\n  - Effect on households: This was caused by federal policy decisions to reduce or tighten eligibility for key benefit programs. As a result:\n    - Economic precarity increased among low‑ and moderate‑income residents.\n    - Evidence included “greater food pantry use” and more difficulty paying rent, utilities, and other bills.\n  - Effect on nonprofits: As a result of these planned cuts and rising prices, nonprofits providing food assistance and basic‑needs support:\n    - Faced higher demand for food pantries and emergency assistance.\n    - Had to stretch limited resources across more clients, increasing operational strain even before cuts fully took effect.\n\n- New York (Second District)\n  - Cause: Many nonprofits reported challenges stemming from “unpredictable funding and a reduction in federal benefit programs” [BeigeBook_20251015, New York, Community Perspectives]. One community health‑care center highlighted rising financial distress among Medicaid patients.\n  - Effect on clients: This was caused by reductions or changes in federal benefits that left Medicaid patients with higher out‑of‑pocket burdens or less income support. As a result:\n    - Medicaid patients experienced greater financial distress.\n    - Their ability to access care was limited.\n  - Effect on nonprofits: As a result of clients’ weakened financial position and reduced program support:\n    - The community health‑care center delivered more uncompensated or under‑compensated care.\n    - The organization’s finances were strained, because federal reimbursements and patient payments did not cover rising needs.\n\n2. Uncertainty and potential cuts in federal grants → Funding instability → Staffing restraint and use of reserves\n\n- Cleveland (Fourth District)\n  - Cause: Nonprofit contacts cited uncertainty around federal grants, alongside a “growing share” of organizations reporting funding decreases over the prior six months [BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland, Community Conditions]. This was caused by changing or unclear federal funding commitments.\n  - Effect on nonprofit budgets:\n    - More nonprofits reported decreased funding, undermining financial stability.\n    - One organization had to dip into its reserve fund “for the first time in more than ten years” to cover operating expenses.\n  - Effect on staffing:\n    - A respondent reported that “the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants.”\n    - As a result, nonprofits constrained headcount not by mass layoffs but by leaving vacancies unfilled, reducing capacity to expand or maintain services even as needs were rising.\n\n- Chicago (Seventh District)\n  - Cause: Nonprofits anticipated tighter overall funding and smaller budgets going forward, in a context of reduced income and donations and higher operating costs (including insurance) [BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago, Community Conditions]. While the text does not tie this solely to federal grants, federal funding uncertainty is part of the broader environment.\n  - Effect on financial planning:\n    - Many nonprofits, in planning for 2026, expected to “find new funding streams and adapt to smaller budgets.”\n    - This was caused by anticipated constraints in public and private revenue sources.\n  - Effect on operations and services:\n    - Social service providers, facing higher costs and weaker income, had to think carefully about which services to prioritize.\n    - As a result, some programs were likely to be scaled back or deferred, even though community needs remained.\n    - However, Chicago contacts reported “no change in activity over the reporting period,” indicating that, to date, demand had not yet surged in the way seen in Boston, and impacts were more about forward‑looking adjustment than current cutbacks.\n\n3. Federal policy impacts on household economic security → Shifts in service mix and volume\n\nAcross districts, changes in federal benefit policies and the broader federal funding environment altered household economic security and labor‑market conditions, which in turn changed what clients needed from nonprofits:\n\n- In Boston, planned SNAP and Medicaid cuts, compounded by inflation, caused more households to struggle with food, rent, and utilities. As a result, nonprofits saw increased food‑pantry use and higher demand for basic‑needs assistance.\n\n- In New York, reductions in federal benefit programs and the financial distress of Medicaid patients caused more people to lose or defer access to health care. As a result, safety‑net health nonprofits bore more uncompensated care and greater financial risk.\n\n- In Cleveland, worsening labor‑market outcomes for vulnerable groups (for example, formerly incarcerated jobseekers facing more difficulty securing employment and more workers offered only part‑time jobs with few benefits) were reported [BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland, Community Conditions]. This was caused by broader economic and policy conditions, potentially including benefit and labor‑related policies. As a result, community need for workforce and social supports likely grew, even as nonprofit funding declined—though the Beige Book does not quantify the change in service volume.\n\n4. Summary of cross‑district patterns: common mechanisms, different manifestations\n\nPutting these findings together, federal policy changes affected nonprofits through similar mechanisms but with region‑specific outcomes:\n\n- Mechanism 1: Changes to federal benefit programs (SNAP, Medicaid, other federal benefits)\n  - Caused increased financial strain on low‑income and Medicaid‑eligible households.\n  - As a result, nonprofits in Boston and New York faced higher demand for food, housing support, and health services and more uncompensated care.\n\n- Mechanism 2: Uncertainty and tightening in federal grants and related funding streams\n  - Caused nonprofits—especially in Cleveland—to experience decreased funding and unpredictable revenue.\n  - As a result, organizations drew down reserves for the first time in years, avoided filling vacancies, and prepared for smaller budgets (Cleveland and Chicago).\n\n- Mechanism 3: Higher operating costs coinciding with weaker revenues\n  - Caused by a combination of policy and market conditions (including insurance and other cost increases).\n  - As a result, nonprofits in Chicago and elsewhere had to prioritize among services and seek new funding streams, even when reported activity levels had not yet changed.\n\nOverall, federal policy changes did not simply “cut money” to nonprofits; they altered the financial position of both clients and organizations. This was caused by reductions and uncertainties in federal benefits and grants. As a result, nonprofits across multiple districts faced a dual squeeze: more people needing help (especially with food, housing, and health care) at the same time that funding became less reliable, forcing staffing restraint, use of reserves, and difficult choices about which services to maintain or cut.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the expected answer:\n1) New York District: nonprofits faced challenges from unpredictable funding and reduced federal benefit programs; a community health-care center reported financial distress among Medicaid patients.\n2) Cleveland District: nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to uncertainty around federal grants.\n3) Boston District: cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in education and health-care sectors.\n\nNow compare with the system answer:\n- New York: The system states that nonprofits faced challenges from “unpredictable funding and a reduction in federal benefit programs” and that a community health-care center saw rising financial distress among Medicaid patients. This matches the expected answer accurately.\n- Cleveland: The system explicitly says “the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants,” matching the key Cleveland point. It adds details about reserve funds but does not contradict anything.\n- Boston: The expected answer focuses on “cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health-care sectors.” The system answer discusses Boston in terms of planned SNAP and Medicaid cuts increasing household precarity and demand for nonprofit services; it does NOT mention layoffs or cuts to federal grant funding to education and health-care nonprofits. So the Boston-specific expected fact about layoffs from grant cuts is missing and effectively replaced by a different mechanism (benefit cuts to households), which is not in the ground truth.\n\nThere are no clear factual errors relative to the expected answer, but the system omits a key element (Boston layoffs due to federal grant cuts) and instead introduces another Boston-related mechanism that isn’t in the expected answer. New York and Cleveland are covered correctly; Boston is incomplete/incorrect with respect to what was asked for. This fits \"partially correct\": some key facts are covered correctly, but not all, and there is no direct contradiction of the ground truth statements.\n",

      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) The sectors with labor shortages due to immigration policy were: hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing.\n2) The St. Louis District explicitly reported immigration policies resulting in labor shortages.\n3) The Boston District discussion: retail and tourism contacts worried about next summer’s labor supply due to expected reductions in seasonal visas, with Maine and Vermont seeing increased labor market slack.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer correctly lists the four sectors: hospitality (hospitality / leisure and hospitality), agriculture, construction, and manufacturing.\n- It correctly highlights the St. Louis District as having the most detailed and prominent link between immigration policies and labor shortages, including sectors and mechanisms; this aligns with the ground truth.\n- However, it does not mention the Boston District at all, nor does it mention retail and tourism contacts there, or the Maine and Vermont detail. Instead, it introduces the New York District as another prominent district, which is not part of the expected answer. While that information might be true to the source document, it does not match the expected answer and omits the required Boston-specific content.\n- There are no direct factual contradictions to the expected answer, but the omission of Boston and the substitution with New York means an important part of the expected answer is missing.\n\nThus, the answer captures some but not all key facts and has no clear factual errors relative to the expected answer; it is incomplete rather than incorrect or abstaining.",

      "question": "How did firms in different sectors respond to tariff-induced cost increases in terms of their pricing strategies?",
      "expected_answer": "Responses to tariff-induced costs varied by sector: In manufacturing and retail trades, some firms fully passed higher import costs along to customers. Other firms facing tariff-induced cost pressures kept selling prices largely unchanged to preserve market share and due to pushback from price-sensitive clients. In Chicago, a retail industry analyst expected peak tariff impact in the first half of 2026.",
      "system_answer": "Below is a side‑by‑side comparison of how firms in major sectors adjusted their pricing strategies when tariffs raised their costs.\n\n---\n**1. Overall Pricing Response: Pass‑through vs. Absorption**\n\n- **Manufacturing firms**  \n  • More likely to increase selling prices or add surcharges, passing through a large share of tariff‑related input cost increases [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].  \n  • Smaller manufacturers, in particular, tended to pass along a *larger* share of tariff costs than larger manufacturers, reflecting thinner margins and less ability to absorb shocks [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].  \n  • However, some manufacturers (e.g., auto producers in the Atlanta District) deliberately absorbed cost increases—at least temporarily—to avoid further demand declines or to clear pre‑tariff inventory [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n- **Retail firms**  \n  • Frequently passed through tariff costs, especially in mid‑ to high‑end product segments where customers were less price‑sensitive [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].  \n  • Use of selective pass‑through was common: raising prices on some items while discounting or holding prices steady on others, depending on perceived elasticity of demand [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n- **Service‑sector firms (excluding restaurants)**  \n  • Showed mixed behavior. Some service providers reported that they could raise prices with little resistance, so they passed through much of the cost increase [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].  \n  • Others, such as certain insurance providers, encountered strong pushback and therefore absorbed more of the cost shock in their margins rather than fully raising prices [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n- **Restaurants**  \n  • Least likely to fully pass through tariff‑induced cost increases. Many kept menu prices largely unchanged, despite higher costs for food, beverages, or imported items (e.g., wine) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].  \n  • Instead of explicit price hikes, they absorbed costs or used indirect adjustments (smaller portions, recipe changes) to protect market share and avoid deterring highly price‑sensitive customers [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n---\n**2. Use of Granular / Selective Pricing Strategies**\n\n- **Manufacturing**  \n  • Often used product‑ or contract‑specific price adjustments and surcharges (e.g., Boston‑area and Cleveland manufacturers, Minneapolis manufacturers) rather than uniform price increases across all output [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].  \n  • Some firms waited to raise prices until pre‑tariff inventories were depleted, causing delayed and staggered pass‑through [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n- **Retail**  \n  • Strong reliance on item‑level, demand‑elasticity‑based pricing. Retailers tended to:  \n    – Pass through tariff costs more fully on mid‑ and high‑end goods where customers are less price‑sensitive.  \n    – Limit price increases or rely on promotions and discounts in highly price‑sensitive categories, leading to incomplete pass‑through [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n- **Services (non‑restaurant)**  \n  • Where demand was relatively inelastic (e.g., certain business services), firms raised fees or rates with little pushback.  \n  • Where customers were more price‑sensitive (e.g., some insurance products), firms constrained headline price increases and adjusted margins or coverage details instead [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n- **Restaurants**  \n  • Frequently avoided conspicuous list‑price hikes. Instead, they:  \n    – Adjusted portion sizes, quality, or menu composition.  \n    – Changed promotions or add‑ons rather than base prices.  \n  • This made tariff pass‑through more hidden and typically incomplete [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n---\n**3. Role of Competitive and Demand Conditions**\n\n- **Manufacturing**  \n  • In relatively less competitive niches or where buyers had fewer substitutes, manufacturers could pass through more of the tariff cost (e.g., upstate New York appliance maker, several Minneapolis manufacturers) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].  \n  • In highly competitive, cyclical segments (e.g., some auto producers), firms prioritized volume and market share, absorbing tariff costs to avoid further weakening demand [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n- **Retail**  \n  • Intense competition from online and big‑box retailers kept full pass‑through in check on mass‑market, price‑sensitive items.  \n  • In contrast, niche or higher‑end retailers faced less direct price competition and could more easily raise prices in line with higher landed costs [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n- **Services and Restaurants**  \n  • Many services with captive or contractual clients could implement price increases with relatively little churn, supporting greater pass‑through [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].  \n  • Restaurants and some consumer‑facing services operated in highly competitive environments with very elastic demand; fear of customer loss constrained overt price increases, encouraging cost absorption and non‑price adjustments instead [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n---\n**4. Firm Size and International Dimension**\n\n- **Smaller vs. larger manufacturers**  \n  • Smaller manufacturers: more likely to raise prices or add surcharges, passing through a higher share of tariff‑driven cost increases because they had less financial capacity to absorb shocks [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].  \n  • Larger manufacturers: somewhat more able to smooth or absorb costs—at least temporarily—via scale economies, hedging, or inventory management [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n- **Foreign vs. domestic producers**  \n  • In some cases, foreign manufacturers themselves absorbed part of the tariff burden (e.g., by cutting export prices) to preserve U.S. market share, reducing the extent of pass‑through required by domestic importers [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].\n\n---\n**Summary Comparison**\n\n- **Manufacturing & many retailers:** More inclined toward *explicit price increases and surcharges* with substantial (though not always complete) pass‑through of tariff costs, especially where demand is less elastic or products are higher‑end.  \n- **Services (select segments):** Mixed responses; inelastic, contract‑based services often passed through costs, while more competitive or regulated segments absorbed more.  \n- **Restaurants & some consumer services:** Relied heavily on *cost absorption and non‑price adjustments* (portions, offerings) rather than list‑price increases, reflecting highly price‑sensitive demand and strong competitive pressures.\n\n[All sectoral evidence: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025‑10‑15]\n",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Sectoral variation in response.\n2) In manufacturing and retail, some firms fully passed higher import costs through to customers.\n3) Other firms kept selling prices largely unchanged to preserve market share and because of pushback from price‑sensitive clients.\n4) A specific note that in Chicago, a retail industry analyst expected the peak tariff impact in the first half of 2026.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer clearly describes sectoral variation (manufacturing, retail, services, restaurants) and repeatedly distinguishes between passing through costs and absorbing them. This captures points (1), (2), and (3) in substance: it states that manufacturers and retailers often passed through costs, but that some firms in competitive/price‑sensitive contexts kept prices steady or used non‑price measures to preserve demand and market share.\n- There is no contradiction of the ground truth on those points, only more detail.\n- However, the system answer does not mention anything about the Chicago District or a retail industry analyst’s expectation that the tariff impact would peak in the first half of 2026. That specific temporal/locational detail (point 4) is entirely missing.\n\nBecause the main qualitative content is right but a key detail from the expected answer (Chicago analyst, H1 2026 peak impact) is absent, the answer is accurate but incomplete rather than fully correct.",

      "question": "What was the relationship between federal policy and electric vehicle sales, and how did this affect overall auto sales?",
      "expected_answer": "Auto sales were boosted in some districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September. However, in the Chicago District, light vehicle sales declined overall, especially for EVs following the end of federal tax credits. This shows the federal tax credit created a pre-expiration demand surge followed by a post-expiration decline.",
      "system_answer": "Federal policy and electric vehicle (EV) sales were linked through the federal EV tax credit, and this link created a clear chain of cause and effect that also shaped overall auto sales.\n\n1. **Federal policy → EV buying incentives**  \n   - The federal government offered a **tax credit for EV purchases**, but this credit was scheduled to **expire at the end of September**.\n   - This impending expiration **created a time‑sensitive incentive**: consumers who were already considering EVs had a strong reason to buy *before* the deadline.  \n   - This was caused by the structure of the policy itself: the tax credit reduced the effective purchase price, but only for vehicles bought before the cutoff date. Once the credit was set to expire, waiting meant losing that financial benefit.  \n   - As a result, households and firms **pulled forward EV purchases** into the months and weeks leading up to the expiration. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. **Policy deadline → Short‑term surge in EV sales**  \n   - Multiple Federal Reserve Districts reported a **“rush to buy” EVs** specifically tied to the **impending expiration** of the federal tax credit. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - This was caused by buyers accelerating their timing: people who might have bought later instead bought *now* to capture the tax credit.\n   - As a result:\n     - Nationally, auto sales in some Districts were **“boosted … by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September.”** [National Summary, BeigeBook_20251015]\n     - In the **Philadelphia District**, dealers saw a noticeable **rush into EVs** before the deadline. [Philadelphia, Trade and Services, BeigeBook_20251015]\n     - In the **Chicago District**, **new light vehicle sales were “brisk,”** and this was explicitly attributed **in part to “the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases.”** [Chicago, Consumer Spending, BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - After the deadline passed, the Kansas City District reported that **demand shifted away from EVs** toward sedans and used vehicles, indicating that the earlier strength in EV sales was **temporary and policy‑driven** rather than a steady underlying trend. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n3. **EV surge → Effects on overall auto sales (support and cushioning)**  \n   The policy‑driven spike in EV sales had two main effects on total auto sales, depending on local conditions:\n\n   **a. In some areas, EV sales lifted overall auto sales above baseline**  \n   - Because of the EV rush, some Districts saw **modest increases** or **brisk** overall new vehicle sales:\n     - In parts of New England (e.g., New Hampshire) and the **Chicago District**, overall new light vehicle sales rose or were described as “brisk,” **specifically because** of EV purchases tied to ending incentives. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - This was caused by EV purchases adding incremental volume to otherwise tepid showrooms; customers who might have delayed or skipped buying altogether chose to purchase in order to capture the tax benefit.\n   - As a result, **overall auto sales were higher than they would have been** in those regions during the incentive window.\n\n   **b. In other areas, EV sales softened what would have been larger declines**  \n   - In the **Philadelphia District**, overall auto sales actually **declined slightly**, but dealers reported that **they would have fallen more** without the EV rush:  \n     - “Auto dealers reported a slight decrease in auto sales… **sales would have fallen by more if not for a rush to buy electric vehicles (EVs) before the expiration of a federal EV tax credit at the end of September.**” [Philadelphia, Trade and Services, BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - This was caused by the broader backdrop of soft consumer spending and weak demand for non‑EV autos; only the policy‑driven EV purchases provided offsetting volume.\n   - As a result, EV sales **cushioned** the downturn in total auto sales rather than turning it into an increase.\n\n4. **Broader context: auto market softness without the EV policy boost**  \n   - Outside of the EV effect, many areas reported **flat to weak auto sales**:\n     - **Cleveland:** “Auto dealers generally reported that **sales were flat to down**, except for used car sales…” [Cleveland, Consumer Spending, BeigeBook_20251015]\n     - **Dallas:** “Auto dealers reported **weak sales** and tighter margins due to higher costs.” [Dallas, Retail Sales, BeigeBook_20251015]\n     - Nationally, overall consumer spending on goods **“inched down,”** and several Districts noted a **slight softening** in economic activity. [National Summary, BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - This weakness was caused by factors like softer consumer demand and cost pressures, not directly by EV policy.\n   - As a result, the EV‑tax‑credit effect stands out as a **targeted, temporary support**: where EVs were important in the sales mix, auto dealers saw better outcomes than they otherwise would have; where EV penetration was low, overall auto sales remained flat or weak.\n\n5. **Cause‑effect chain summarized**  \n   - **Federal EV tax credit with a fixed expiration date**  \n     → caused consumers to **advance or concentrate EV purchases** into the pre‑expiration period (especially late September).  \n   - **Concentrated EV demand before expiration**  \n     → caused a **short‑term surge (“rush”) in EV sales** in several Districts and **brisk new light vehicle sales** where EVs were a significant share. [Philadelphia; Chicago; National Summary, BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - **This EV surge**  \n     → caused **overall auto sales** to be:  \n       • **Boosted** in some regions (turning otherwise flat conditions into modest gains or brisk sales), and  \n       • **Less negative** in others (cushioning declines that would have been steeper without the EV rush).  \n   - **After the credit expired**, with no policy incentive pulling demand forward, EV sales softened and some demand **shifted away from EVs** to other vehicle types, so the **support to overall auto sales faded.** [Kansas City, BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nOverall, federal EV policy did not create broad, sustained strength in the auto market, but it **temporarily reshaped the timing and composition of auto sales**—front‑loading EV purchases into the incentive window and thereby **propping up or cushioning overall auto sales** in an otherwise soft retail environment.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key points in the expected answer:\n1) There was a federal EV tax credit set to expire at the end of September.\n2) Ahead of expiration, EV demand surged and boosted auto sales in some districts.\n3) In the Chicago District specifically, light vehicle sales declined overall after the credit ended, especially EVs.\n4) This pattern shows a pre‑expiration demand surge followed by a post‑expiration decline.\n\nThe system answer:\n- Correctly describes a federal EV tax credit expiring at the end of September and that this created a time‑sensitive incentive, pulling forward EV purchases (matches points 1 and 2).\n- Correctly notes that some districts saw auto sales \"boosted\" by strong EV demand before expiration (matches part of point 2 and the first sentence of the ground truth).\n- Correctly states that after the deadline, demand shifted away from EVs in at least one district (Kansas City), and that the policy caused only a temporary, front‑loaded boost to sales (aligned with the general idea of a surge then softening).\n\nHowever, it diverges from the expected answer in two important ways:\n- It never mentions the post‑expiration decline in the Chicago District or that light vehicle sales there declined overall, especially for EVs, after the tax credits ended (missing key point 3).\n- It instead claims Chicago had \"brisk\" new light vehicle sales attributed in part to the end of incentives, implying strength rather than the decline described in the expected answer, which conflicts with the stated Chicago outcome.\n\nSo although much of the general causal story (federal tax credit → pre‑expiration EV surge → temporary support to auto sales) is correct, a key district‑specific detail (Chicago experiencing an overall decline in light vehicle sales, especially EVs, after expiration) is both omitted and implicitly contradicted by saying sales were brisk there. That makes the answer not just incomplete but partially inconsistent with the expected answer.\n\nGiven that there is some correct overlapping content (relationship between policy and EV sales, and effect on total sales as a temporary boost), but also a contradiction regarding Chicago/post‑expiration outcome, the best classification is INCORRECT rather than merely incomplete.",

      "question": "What were the multiple factors affecting labor costs, and how did they interact with wage growth?",
      "expected_answer": "Wages grew at a modest to moderate pace across all districts. However, labor cost pressures intensified due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses. Additionally, some contacts in the Chicago District reported moderate increases in nonlabor costs including energy and higher prices for raw materials. This meant total compensation costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.",
      "system_answer": "Labor costs were pushed up by several interacting forces. Wage growth was only one part; rising benefits and other costs often made total labor costs grow faster than wages themselves.\n\n1. Employer health insurance and other benefits\n- Across all reporting Districts, wages rose at a modest to moderate pace, **but labor cost pressures intensified because employer‑sponsored health insurance expenses jumped sharply**. This was caused by “outsized increases in employer‑sponsored health insurance expenses” even while base pay only crept up.\n- In Chicago, wages and benefits were up modestly, **but many employers reported higher health insurance premiums**. As a result, total compensation per worker rose more than wage rates alone.\n- In St. Louis, a regional airport gave a 4% cost‑of‑living wage increase **and** a “significant” increase in employer health‑insurance contributions. This was caused by benefit obligations rising alongside pay, so the employer’s labor cost per worker grew faster than 4%.\n- In Minneapolis, Dallas, and Philadelphia, firms reported large increases in employee health‑care premiums and business/other insurance. This was caused by rapid increases in health‑ and insurance‑related costs, which pushed up the cost of employing each worker even where wage growth remained modest.\n\nCause–effect: \n- **Cause:** Outsized increases in health insurance and related benefit costs.\n- **Effect:** Total labor costs (wages + benefits) accelerated more than wage growth, so firms felt stronger cost pressure than “modest to moderate” wage gains would suggest.\n\n2. Other non‑wage and nonlabor input costs\n- In Cleveland and other Districts, firms faced **robust increases in nonlabor input costs**—tariff‑driven jumps in raw materials, imported components, chemicals, food products, utilities, technology, and insurance.\n- Minneapolis contacts cited **significant increases in electricity rates and employee health‑care premiums**; similar pressures were noted elsewhere.\n\nInteraction with wage growth:\n- These rising nonlabor costs squeezed margins. This was caused by tariffs and higher utilities/technology/insurance costs, which raised overall operating expenses.\n- As a result, firms had **less room to accelerate wages**, helping keep wage growth modest to moderate even as total costs climbed. Wage growth did not fall to zero, but companies were cautious about raising pay further because other costs were already rising quickly.\n\n3. Sectoral labor shortages and wage pressure\n- Labor supply was described as **strained in hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing** in several Districts, with some shortages linked to immigration policy changes.\n\nCause–effect:\n- **Cause:** Reduced labor supply (especially in hospitality and agriculture in places like south Georgia) due to immigration changes and other factors.\n- **Effect:** Upward pressure on wages and labor costs in those specific sectors, even while labor demand overall was “generally muted.” This meant wage growth could be stronger where shortages were acute, adding to labor cost pressure there, while remaining modest elsewhere.\n\n4. Muted labor demand, uncertainty, and staffing strategies\n- Nationally, demand for labor was “generally muted” and uncertainty was elevated. Many employers **kept employment levels flat or reduced headcount** through layoffs and attrition, and some shifted hiring toward **temporary and part‑time workers** instead of full‑time staff. Some also invested in AI and other technologies and reduced lower‑skilled positions.\n\nInteraction with wage growth and labor costs:\n- **Cause:** Weaker demand and higher uncertainty, combined with rising benefit and other costs.\n- **Effect on wage growth:** Employers were reluctant to bid wages up aggressively; wage gains stayed modest or moderate rather than accelerating.\n- **Effect on total labor costs:** Even with modest wage increases, firms tried to **contain their total labor bills** by:\n  - Holding headcounts steady or cutting staff.\n  - Using more temporary/part‑time roles (which often carry lower benefit costs per hour).\n  - Substituting capital (e.g., AI) for labor in some tasks.\n- As a result, firms partially offset rising per‑worker costs (from wages plus benefits) by adjusting how many and what types of workers they employed.\n\n5. Pricing decisions in response to combined cost pressures\n- Tariffs, utilities, insurance, and health‑care costs raised overall cost structures. Some firms responded by **raising selling prices** (especially in manufacturing and retail), while others held prices steady to preserve market share despite higher costs.\n\nCause–effect:\n- **Cause:** Modest wage growth plus outsized increases in health insurance, insurance generally, and tariff‑driven input costs.\n- **Effect:** Firms faced tighter margins and therefore:\n  - Limited wage growth to modest/moderate rates.\n  - Adjusted staffing (fewer full‑time hires, more temp/part‑time, layoffs/attrition).\n  - Increased prices where possible to recoup higher labor and nonlabor costs.\n\nOverall interaction with wage growth\n- Wages **did** grow across all Districts, typically in the low‑to‑mid single digits (e.g., 3–4% examples in St. Louis), but **this wage growth was not the main source of rising labor costs**.\n- The main amplification came from **non‑wage components**—especially employer‑sponsored health insurance and other insurance/benefit costs, plus higher utilities and other inputs. This was caused by sharp increases in these items, described nationally as “outsized” in the case of health insurance.\n- As a result, even with only modest wage gains, **total labor costs rose more quickly**, and firms reacted by restraining further wage increases, managing headcount and job mix, and adjusting prices where they could.\n\nInformation limits\n- The excerpts do not provide detailed quantitative shares of wages vs benefits in total labor costs, nor do they document childcare cost dynamics, explicit wage freezes, or consistent hiring “at or near minimum wage.” Those specific mechanisms cannot be confirmed from the cited material.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements in the expected answer:\n1) Wages grew at a modest to moderate pace across all districts.\n2) Labor cost pressures intensified primarily because of outsized increases in employer‑sponsored health insurance expenses (benefits).\n3) Some Chicago contacts noted moderate increases in nonlabor costs, including energy and higher prices for raw materials.\n4) Therefore, total compensation/labor costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer clearly states that wages rose at a modest to moderate pace and that labor cost pressures intensified because employer‑sponsored health insurance expenses increased sharply. This aligns directly with points (1) and (2).\n- It explicitly notes that total labor costs (wages + benefits) were rising faster than wages themselves, matching point (4).\n- It mentions non‑wage and nonlabor input costs (tariff‑driven raw materials, utilities, etc.), which is consistent in spirit with the Chicago reference to higher energy and raw materials costs, though the system expands beyond Chicago and beyond what is in the expected answer. However, this expansion doesn’t contradict the ground truth.\n- The extra sections on sectoral labor shortages, muted labor demand, staffing strategies, pricing decisions, and detailed district‑by‑district examples go well beyond the expected answer but are not inconsistent with it.\n- There are no factual contradictions with the expected answer regarding the relationship between multiple cost factors and wage growth.\n\nBecause all key facts from the expected answer are present and correctly described, and the additional details do not introduce errors relative to the ground truth, the answer is best classified as correct rather than merely partial.",

Demand from restaurant groups remained solid, as indicated by commercial real estate leasing activity.",
      "system_answer": "In the Chicago District, shifts in consumer spending patterns led to different outcomes across restaurant segments through several clear cause‑and‑effect channels:\n\n1. **Modestly higher overall consumer spending → Strength in value-oriented restaurant segments**  \n   - Consumer spending in the District **“increased modestly.”** [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - This was **caused by** households being willing to spend a bit more overall, but still showing caution and price sensitivity.  \n   - **As a result**, the spending that did increase flowed disproportionately into **lower- and mid-priced restaurant segments**—specifically **fast food, fast casual, and family dining**—where contacts reported **“increased spending.”** [BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - These segments benefited because they offer **affordable, everyday dining options**, aligning with consumers’ desire to eat out without committing to high check sizes.\n\n2. **Preference for affordable, informal dining → Stronger performance at fast food, fast casual, and family dining**  \n   - Consumers appeared to favor **more affordable, informal dining formats** over higher-end or special-occasion venues.  \n   - This was **caused by** continued price sensitivity: people were still watching budgets but not cutting out dining out entirely.  \n   - **As a result**, restaurants in the **fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments** saw **clear upticks in spending** and thus stronger sales. There is **no reported weakness** in these specific categories for the Chicago District. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n3. **Mixed leisure and hospitality spending, with softness in travel-related categories → Restaurant growth driven mainly by local, everyday demand**  \n   - The Beige Book notes that overall **leisure and hospitality sales were mixed**, and that there was **softness in airlines and hotels** in the Chicago District. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - This weakness in travel-related sectors was **caused by** slower tourism and business travel relative to other types of spending.  \n   - **As a result**, restaurant strength in Chicago appears to be **driven more by local resident spending** than by visitors:  \n     - Everyday, local, value-focused dining (fast food, fast casual, family dining) did well.  \n     - Travel-dependent or higher-end venues that rely more on tourism or business travel likely did not share equally in the gains, although the report does **not** provide specific segment detail for those categories in Chicago.\n\n4. **Limited evidence on higher-end or other sit-down formats → Uneven but not fully quantifiable impact**  \n   - The Beige Book **does not report** Chicago-specific outcomes for luxury, full-service casual, or other sit-down formats.  \n   - This absence is **caused by** a lack of segment-level commentary in the Chicago section, not by confirmed weakness or strength.  \n   - **As a result**, we can say that:  \n     - The **clear winners** from current spending patterns are **fast food, fast casual, and family dining** restaurants.  \n     - The impact on **higher-end or other full-service restaurants in Chicago cannot be determined** from the available evidence.\n\nOverall cause-effect chain:  \n- **Modest overall spending increase + heightened price sensitivity** → consumers prioritize **value and convenience** → **increased spending at fast food, fast casual, and family dining restaurants** → these segments experience **relatively strong conditions**, even while the broader leisure and hospitality sector is **mixed** and travel-related categories show **softness**.

      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) In the Chicago District, leisure and hospitality sales were mixed.\n2) There was softness in some travel-related categories, including airlines and hotels.\n3) There was increased spending at restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments.\n4) Demand from restaurant groups remained solid, as indicated by commercial real estate leasing activity.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer correctly states that leisure and hospitality sales were mixed in Chicago and that there was softness in airlines and hotels. This matches points (1) and (2).\n- It correctly highlights increased spending at fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments, in line with point (3).\n- It also aligns with the overall directional interpretation: strength in value-oriented segments amid mixed leisure and hospitality.\n- However, the system answer does not mention that demand from restaurant groups remained solid as indicated by commercial real estate leasing activity, which is a key part of the expected answer.\n- Much of the additional causal narrative (e.g., \"caused by households being willing to spend a bit more,\" \"driven more by local resident spending\") goes beyond the ground truth but is not explicitly contradicted by it; still, these are speculative extensions not present in the expected answer. They are not clearly false, but not required.\n\nGiven that all major described effects on restaurant segments (mixed L&H, softness in travel, increased spending in fast food/fast casual/family dining) are correctly captured, but one key fact (solid demand from restaurant groups evidenced by leasing activity) is missing, the answer is accurate but incomplete rather than wrong.\n\nTherefore the best classification is PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

      "question": "How did lower interest rates affect different interest rate-sensitive sectors across districts?",
      "expected_answer": "Lower interest rates had positive effects across multiple sectors: In Cleveland, commercial construction and financial services saw uptick in demand due to lower rates. In Chicago, financial conditions loosened modestly with business loan volumes increasing. However, the impact was mixed - while some reports noted improved business lending, residential real estate remained weak in Dallas and home sales were flat in Boston. The housing market's response to lower rates was more muted than commercial sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Across districts, lower interest rates affected interest‑sensitive sectors in uneven ways, with some clear rate‑driven gains and several muted or mixed responses.\n\n1. Cleveland (Fourth District): clear, direct rate effects\n- Cause: Policy rates moved lower.\n- Effect on commercial construction and financial services: \n  - Commercial construction and financial services contacts “noted an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates.” This was caused by cheaper financing making new projects and borrowing more attractive. [BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Summary of Economic Activity]\n  - Bankers also reported higher loan demand from households and businesses, which was caused by customers responding to the lower borrowing costs. [BeigeBook_20251015, 2025‑10‑15]\n- Effect on residential real estate:\n  - Residential construction and real estate contacts reported **declining** demand in recent weeks, despite the lower rate environment. This weakness was caused in part by homeowners being reluctant to sell and give up their existing low mortgage rates (“lock‑in” effect), which limited listings and transactions. As a result, residential contacts expected flat demand going forward rather than a rate‑driven rebound. [BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Real Estate and Construction]\n\n2. Boston (First District): sentiment up, activity constrained\n- Cause: A recent reduction in the federal funds rate.\n- Effect on commercial real estate:\n  - Commercial real estate activity was “up slightly net of seasonal factors,” and contacts said the rate cut “lifted sentiment somewhat.” This modest improvement was caused by improved financing conditions and optimism about cheaper credit. [BeigeBook_20251015, Boston > Commercial Real Estate]\n  - However, construction activity “remained limited,” which was caused by rising costs and other constraints that offset the positive impact of lower rates. As a result, the sector saw better mood but only small actual gains in building.\n\n3. New York (Second District): mixed construction and real estate response\n- Cause: Interest‑rate movements interacted with broader uncertainty and tariffs.\n- Effect on commercial and industrial real estate/construction:\n  - Commercial real estate markets “continue to improve,” suggesting that lower or more stable rates were one supportive factor.\n  - At the same time, industrial real estate activity was “muted” and construction “continued to decline.” This weakness was caused by “uncertainty around interest rates and tariffs,” which made firms hesitant to commit to new projects even with lower borrowing costs. As a result, rate‑sensitive construction did not broadly accelerate. [BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Real Estate and Construction]\n\n4. San Francisco (Twelfth District): cautious loan response\n- Cause: Recent rate reductions at the national level.\n- Effect on lending/financial services:\n  - Financial institutions saw additional loan demand beginning to materialize; this nascent pickup was caused by lower rates making credit cheaper and more attractive. [BeigeBook_20251015, 2025‑10‑15]\n  - However, overall lending remained largely steady because borrowers stayed cautious amid high uncertainty. As a result, lower rates only modestly increased activity rather than driving a strong credit boom.\n\n5. Dallas (Eleventh District): divergence between commercial real estate and housing\n- Commercial real estate:\n  - Commercial real estate activity “improved,” with office leasing showing more stability and industrial and retail activity remaining solid. Because commercial real estate is highly rate‑sensitive, this strengthening is consistent with support from lower financing costs, though the text does not explicitly attribute the improvement to rate cuts. [BeigeBook_20251015, Dallas > Construction and Real Estate]\n- Housing:\n  - A specific dip in mortgage rates **did not** materially revive the housing sector: housing activity stayed weak, with choppy foot traffic and sales despite lower mortgage rates. This muted response was caused by non‑rate factors—such as affordability issues, inventory constraints, or buyer uncertainty—overwhelming the incentive created by cheaper mortgages. [BeigeBook_20251015, 2025‑10‑15]\n\n6. Summary of cross‑district cause‑effect patterns\n- Where effects were strongest and clearest:\n  - Cleveland stands out: commercial construction and financial services saw an explicit increase in demand **because of lower interest rates**, and banks reported stronger loan demand linked directly to these lower borrowing costs.\n- Where effects were present but constrained:\n  - Boston: the rate cut **caused** improved sentiment and a slight uptick in commercial real estate activity, but high costs **caused** construction to remain limited.\n  - New York: lower or more stable rates helped commercial real estate, but uncertainty around future rates and tariffs **caused** industrial real estate weakness and ongoing declines in construction.\n  - San Francisco: lower rates began to **cause** some additional loan demand, but high uncertainty **caused** borrowers to stay cautious, so overall lending barely moved.\n- Where effects were weak or offset:\n  - Dallas: lower mortgage rates did not translate into stronger housing; other headwinds **caused** housing activity to remain weak, even as broader commercial real estate improved for reasons only partly attributable to financing conditions.\n  - In several districts’ residential markets (e.g., Cleveland, Dallas), structural issues like homeowners’ rate lock‑in, high costs, and uncertainty **caused** residential activity to stay flat or weak despite cheaper credit.\n\nOverall, lower interest rates were most clearly linked to stronger demand in Cleveland’s commercial construction and financial services sectors. Elsewhere, the same lower‑rate environment often only modestly improved sentiment or specific commercial segments and was frequently offset by cost pressures, uncertainty, or structural constraints—especially in residential real estate—so interest‑sensitive sectors did not uniformly accelerate across districts.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n- Lower interest rates had positive effects in multiple sectors, clearly: \n  - Cleveland: commercial construction and financial services saw an uptick in demand due to lower interest rates.\n  - Chicago: financial conditions loosened modestly, with business loan volumes increasing.\n- Impact was mixed: some improved business lending, but residential real estate remained weak in Dallas and home sales were flat in Boston.\n- Overall, housing’s response to lower rates was more muted than commercial sectors.\n\nComparison with system answer:\n- The system answer correctly states that lower rates led to stronger demand in Cleveland’s commercial construction and financial services, explicitly tying this to lower interest rates. This matches the ground truth.\n- It correctly notes that Dallas housing remained weak despite lower mortgage rates, i.e., a muted housing response. This aligns with the ground truth.\n- For Boston, the system says commercial real estate activity was up slightly and sentiment improved with rate cuts, and construction remained limited. The ground truth only needed that home sales were flat; the system does not contradict this but focuses on commercial real estate and construction rather than explicitly stating that home sales were flat. This is an omission but not an error.\n- The system answer does not mention Chicago at all, so it omits the key fact that financial conditions there loosened modestly with increased business loan volumes.\n- The system adds districts not required by the expected answer (New York, San Francisco) and provides more detail. These additions are not flagged as incorrect by the prompt, because we are not checking against the Beige Book itself, only against the expected answer. Nothing in these additions contradicts the expected answer’s content.\n- The system’s overall summary is consistent with the expected narrative: clearer positive effects in some commercial/financial sectors and a more muted response in housing.\n\nThus, the system captures several key points (Cleveland positive effects, Dallas weak housing, housing more muted than commercial overall) but omits Chicago and does not clearly state Boston’s flat home sales. There are no evident contradictions with the expected answer. This makes it incomplete but not wrong.\n",

      "question": "How did federal funding changes affect employment in specific sectors?",
      "expected_answer": "Federal funding changes negatively impacted employment across multiple sectors: In Boston, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in education and health-care sectors. In Cleveland, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to federal grant uncertainty. In New York, nonprofits faced challenges from reduced federal benefit programs, with community health-care centers reporting financial strain. Manufacturing employment in Boston was mixed, with one firm shedding workers to offset tariff-related cost increases.",
      "system_answer": "Across the reported Federal Reserve Districts, negative changes in federal funding—either outright cuts or heightened uncertainty—caused weaker employment outcomes in several specific sectors. The causal chain generally runs from funding cuts/uncertainty → organizational financial strain → direct layoffs, hiring freezes, or slower project activity → reduced employment or hours.\n\nBelow is the cause‑effect structure by sector and district, based on the evidence you provided.\n\n---\n\n1. Education and health care (Boston District)\n\n• Cause: Cuts to federal grant funding \n  - In the Boston District, federal grant funding to entities in education and health care was reduced. [BeigeBook_20251015, Boston > Labor Markets]\n\n• Immediate effect on employers:\n  - Education and health‑care providers that depended on these grants faced sudden budget shortfalls.\n\n• Employment outcome:\n  - This was caused by those grant cuts: “Cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health‑care sectors.” As a result, these sectors experienced **direct job losses**—existing employees were laid off despite overall district employment being roughly flat and some IT services hiring.\n\n---\n\n2. Nonprofit sector (Cleveland and Dallas Districts)\n\n**Cleveland District**\n\n• Cause: Decreased funding and uncertainty around federal grants\n  - A semiannual nonprofit survey in the Cleveland District reported that a growing share of nonprofits had seen decreased funding over the previous six months, and some were unsure about the status and continuity of federal grants. [BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Community Conditions]\n\n• Immediate effect on employers:\n  - One nonprofit had to tap its reserve fund for operating expenses for the first time in over a decade, indicating financial stress.\n  - Another respondent reported that, because of uncertainty around federal grants, “the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions.”\n\n• Employment outcome:\n  - This was caused by the combination of reduced and uncertain federal support: organizations **froze hiring** rather than expanding staff. As a result, employment was constrained through **unfilled vacancies**—jobs that might otherwise have been created or filled were deliberately left open, even if incumbents were not laid off.\n\n**Dallas District**\n\n• Cause: Decreased or uncertain federal grant funding for nonprofits\n  - Nonprofits in the Dallas District also faced funding pressure tied to federal sources. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• Immediate effect on employers:\n  - With less predictable revenue, nonprofits sought to cut costs.\n\n• Employment outcome:\n  - This was caused by reduced and uncertain funding: nonprofits “trimmed head counts,” meaning **direct job cuts** in addition to any informal hiring restraint. As a result, employment in the nonprofit sector fell, adding to broader softness in district labor markets.\n\n---\n\n3. Community service providers and related nonprofits (New York and San Francisco Districts)\n\n**New York and San Francisco Districts**\n\n• Cause: Reduced federal benefits and grant cuts\n  - In these districts, nonprofits and community service providers reported that reductions in federal benefits and federal grant cuts had tightened their funding environment. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• Immediate effect on employers:\n  - The organizations experienced financial strain and had fewer resources to maintain or expand services.\n\n• Employment outcome:\n  - This was caused by reduced federal support: the financial strain **limited their ability to provide services**, which in turn put **downward pressure on staffing levels and hours**. As a result, these providers likely responded with reduced hours, slower hiring, greater reliance on part‑time roles, and/or smaller staffs, even where explicit layoff numbers were not reported.\n\n---\n\n4. Nonresidential construction (Philadelphia District)\n\n• Cause: Uncertainty about the status of federal funding for projects\n  - In the Philadelphia District’s nonresidential construction sector, contacts reported that uncertainty over whether federal funding would actually materialize or continue was affecting planned projects. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• Immediate effect on employers and projects:\n  - This uncertainty led developers and contractors to delay or slow previously planned nonresidential projects.\n\n• Employment outcome:\n  - This was caused by the funding uncertainty: when projects are slowed or deferred, there is **less construction activity** than originally expected. As a result, related construction employment was **constrained or grew more slowly**, since firms had fewer active projects on which to deploy workers (even if outright construction layoffs were not specifically enumerated).\n\n---\n\n5. Cross‑sector, cross‑district pattern (no documented positive effects)\n\nAcross the sectors covered—education, health care, nonprofits, community services, and nonresidential construction—the documented causal relationship runs in one direction:\n\n• Cause side:\n  - **Cuts** to federal grant funding or benefits\n  - **Uncertainty** about future federal funding or grant renewals\n\n• Mechanisms:\n  - Budget shortfalls and financial strain\n  - Delayed or scaled‑back projects\n  - Increased caution in hiring and staffing decisions\n\n• Employment side:\n  - **Direct layoffs** (e.g., Boston education and health care; Dallas nonprofits)\n  - **Hiring freezes and unfilled vacancies** (e.g., Cleveland nonprofits)\n  - **Reduced hours or reliance on part‑time staff** (implied in nonprofits and community service providers in New York and San Francisco)\n  - **Constrained employment growth in construction** due to slowed projects (Philadelphia nonresidential construction)\n\nBy contrast, within the excerpts you provided, there are **no documented cases** in which **increases** in federal funding are said to have **raised employment** in any sector. As a result, the observed funding–employment connection operates only through negative or uncertain funding shocks, not through positive funding surges.\n\n---\n\nOverall causal conclusion\n\nAcross the documented districts, reductions or uncertainty in federal funding caused organizations in grant‑dependent sectors—especially education, health care, nonprofits, community services, and nonresidential construction—to cut staff, hold positions vacant, or slow project activity. As a result, employment in these sectors was weaker than it would have been under stable or rising federal support, manifesting as layoffs, suppressed hiring, trimmed hours, and constrained job growth rather than expanded employment.\n",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements of the expected answer:\n- Overall: federal funding changes negatively impacted employment across multiple sectors.\n- Boston: cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in education and health‑care sectors.\n- Cleveland: nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to federal grant uncertainty.\n- New York: nonprofits faced challenges from reduced federal benefit programs, with community health‑care centers reporting financial strain.\n- Boston manufacturing: mixed; one firm shed workers to offset tariff‑related cost increases.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer correctly captures the overall theme: negative changes in federal funding and uncertainty leading to weaker employment (layoffs, hiring freezes, constrained growth).\n- Boston: It correctly states that “Cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health‑care sectors.” This matches the expected answer.\n- Cleveland: It accurately describes that due to uncertainty around federal grants, “the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions,” and interprets this as hiring freezes/unfilled vacancies. This matches the expected answer.\n- New York: It notes that nonprofits and community service providers in New York (and San Francisco) reported financial strain due to reduced federal benefits and grant cuts, which limited services and pressured staffing. This is consistent with the expected answer’s point that New York nonprofits, including community health‑care centers, faced challenges and financial strain from reduced federal benefit programs. The system is somewhat more generic but not contradictory.\n- Additional districts: The system adds Dallas and Philadelphia, and San Francisco. These additions are plausible extensions from the referenced context; nothing in them contradicts the expected answer, and they remain within the same causal pattern of funding cuts/uncertainty → weaker employment. The question allows for describing “across the reported Federal Reserve Districts,” so the extra detail is acceptable.\n- Manufacturing in Boston: The expected answer explicitly mentions that manufacturing employment in Boston was mixed, with one firm shedding workers to offset tariff‑related cost increases. The system answer does not mention Boston manufacturing at all. This is a missing key fact, not a contradiction.\n- No clear factual errors are evident in what the system does state; the reasoning about implied reduced hours, etc., is cautious (“likely,” “implied”) and does not contradict the ground truth.\n\nBecause the system captures all the funding–employment effects in education, health care, nonprofits, and New York community providers, but omits the Boston manufacturing point, the answer is incomplete but accurate where it speaks. That fits \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\" rather than \"CORRECT\".\n",

      "question": "What specific factors contributed to economic uncertainty across different districts?",
      "expected_answer": "Multiple factors contributed to uncertainty: Tariff policy changes made planning difficult for manufacturers (noted in Chicago and across districts). Federal grant uncertainty affected nonprofits (Cleveland, New York, Boston). Policy uncertainty was a top business concern (Dallas). Immigration policy changes created labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston). The potential for government shutdown was highlighted as a downside risk. Kansas City noted that despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic.",
      "system_answer": "Across districts, economic uncertainty arose from a mix of broad macro factors and localized conditions. These factors operated through clear cause‑and‑effect channels:\n\n1. **Policy and tariff uncertainty → Delayed investment, weaker orders, and planning difficulty**  \n- **Domestic policy uncertainty and tariffs** created confusion about future costs and market access. This was caused by ongoing debates and changes in trade and domestic policies, including tariffs on various inputs and goods.  \n  - **As a result**, many firms across districts postponed capital expenditures and long‑term investments, since they could not accurately forecast returns or input costs.  \n  - Manufacturers in **Boston, Cleveland, and Philadelphia** specifically cited tariffs and trade policy uncertainty as reasons they were more cautious in planning for 2026 and beyond; in Cleveland, this uncertainty *caused* flat or weaker orders for industrial and agricultural equipment, as customers held off on purchases. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - In **New York**, uncertainty around tariffs and interest rates *caused* muted activity in industrial commercial real estate, as investors and firms delayed or scaled back projects in the face of unclear financing and trade conditions. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. **Uncertainty about interest rates and the broader outlook → “Sideline mentality” among borrowers and investors**  \n- Across several districts, lack of clarity on the path of interest rates and the overall economy made businesses and households cautious.  \n  - In **Richmond**, banks reported that uncertainty about the overall economy and future interest rates *caused* a “sideline mentality,” where potential borrowers delayed taking on debt or expanding operations until conditions became clearer. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - In **New York**, this same uncertainty over rates *contributed to* muted industrial CRE activity, as investors hesitated to commit to long‑term, rate‑sensitive projects. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - As a result, credit demand and investment in rate‑sensitive sectors (like commercial real estate and some business expansions) weakened, reinforcing perceptions of economic fragility.\n\n3. **Inflation and rising or unpredictable input costs → Strain on margins, budgeting challenges, and reduced hiring/investment**  \n- Elevated inflation and volatile input costs (including materials and fertilizer) created uncertainty around future cost trajectories.  \n  - **This was caused by** both general price inflation and tariff‑related increases in the cost of imported inputs.  \n  - Across districts, firms reported that unpredictable costs *discouraged* hiring, equipment purchases, and expansion plans because they could not be sure future revenues would cover higher operating expenses.  \n  - In **Boston**, manufacturers and other contacts noted rising prices linked to tariffs and construction costs; this *made it harder* to plan for 2026, increasing uncertainty about profitability and feasibility of future projects. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n4. **Weak or choppy demand in key sectors → Heightened pessimism and cutbacks**  \n- Sluggish or uneven demand in retail, housing, agriculture, and energy *caused* firms to question the durability of growth.  \n  - Where orders in manufacturing (e.g., in **Cleveland**) were flat or weakening, firms attributed part of this to trade policy uncertainty and tariffs, which *reduced* demand for industrial and agricultural equipment. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - As a result, businesses became more cautious on production, hiring, and inventory building, reinforcing uncertainty about the near‑term economic trajectory.\n\n5. **Housing market concerns → Buyer hesitation and weaker housing activity**  \n- In several districts, economic uncertainty spilled into the housing market.  \n  - This was caused by buyer worries about job security, future interest rates, and overall affordability, as well as by deteriorating credit profiles.  \n  - As a result, potential homebuyers delayed purchases, which in turn contributed to weaker housing activity and more pessimistic outlooks among builders and real estate contacts.  \n  - In **Boston**, workforce housing shortages combined with rising construction costs *increased* anxiety, particularly for low‑ and moderate‑income households, and made housing decisions more uncertain. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n6. **Strains on low‑ and moderate‑income households and social programs → Local demand and social‑service uncertainty**  \n- In **Boston**, concern about low‑ and moderate‑income households grew because cuts to SNAP and Medicaid, together with rising consumer prices, *threatened* their purchasing power and access to services. This was caused by reductions in public benefits and ongoing inflation.  \n  - As a result, local businesses and nonprofits faced uncertainty about future consumer demand and community stability. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- In **Chicago**, nonprofit and community organizations faced higher operating costs and reduced income/donations.  \n  - This was caused by rising expenses (including inflation) and softer or less predictable funding streams.  \n  - As a result, these providers were uncertain about how to balance budgets and prioritize services, heightening overall economic anxiety in the communities they serve. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n7. **Consumer caution and confidence effects → Reduced discretionary spending in tourism and leisure**  \n- In **Minneapolis**, tourism and hospitality contacts reported that “broader economic uncertainties” among households *caused* more cautious behavior, especially around vacations and discretionary travel. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - As a result, consumers cut back on vacation spending, weakening tourism and hospitality revenues and reinforcing uncertainty for businesses in those sectors about future demand.\n\n8. **General uncertainty as a constraint on capacity utilization and expansion**  \n- Even where production was growing, uncertainty itself acted as a drag.  \n  - In **Philadelphia**, more than half of manufacturers reported that economic uncertainty was a moderate or significant constraint on capacity utilization. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - This was caused by the combination of unclear demand, cost volatility, and policy ambiguity.  \n  - As a result, firms refrained from fully using existing capacity or investing in new capacity, despite current production gains, which in turn limited potential growth and contributed to a cautious outlook.\n\nIn sum, economic uncertainty across districts was driven by a web of causes—tariff and policy ambiguity, inflation and volatile input costs, interest‑rate and macroeconomic uncertainty, weak sectoral demand, stress on lower‑income households and nonprofits, and cautious consumer behavior. Each of these factors *led to* delayed investment, restrained borrowing, weaker or postponed spending (especially in housing, industrial investment, and tourism), and underutilization of capacity, thereby amplifying uncertainty about the future path of the economy.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements of the expected answer:\n- Tariff policy changes made planning difficult for manufacturers (Chicago and across districts)\n- Federal grant uncertainty affected nonprofits (Cleveland, New York, Boston)\n- Policy uncertainty was a top business concern (Dallas)\n- Immigration policy changes created labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston)\n- Potential government shutdown was highlighted as a downside risk\n- Kansas City: despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic (so uncertainty coexists with longer‑run optimism)\n\nIn the system answer:\n- It does discuss tariff and policy uncertainty generally and links it to manufacturers, but it incorrectly localizes manufacturers with tariff concerns to Boston, Cleveland, and Philadelphia, not Chicago and “across districts” as in the ground truth.\n- It does mention nonprofit uncertainty, but attributes it to Boston and Chicago and to inflation and funding streams, not to *federal grant uncertainty in Cleveland, New York, Boston* as specified.\n- It does not mention Dallas or that policy uncertainty was a *top business concern* there.\n- It does not mention immigration policy or labor supply concerns in St. Louis or Boston.\n- It does not mention potential government shutdown as a downside risk.\n- It does not mention Kansas City or the specific point that, despite current decline, 2026 expectations were optimistic.\n\nInstead, the answer introduces many factors not in the expected answer (interest‑rate path, inflation generally, housing market concerns, tourism, etc.) and many specific district attributions that are not in the ground truth. Those are hallucinated relative to the expected answer and conflict with the requested specific factors and districts. Therefore, the answer is not just incomplete; it is also misaligned with the expected district‑specific facts and introduces unsupported details. That makes it incorrect under the rubric.",

      "question": "What supply chain disruptions affected manufacturing, and how did they impact production?",
      "expected_answer": "Supply chain challenges varied across districts. In San Francisco, manufacturers noted higher costs for utilities and imported semiconductor chips. In Chicago, manufacturing demand declined modestly with fabricated metals demand unchanged on balance as higher sales to some sectors were offset by lower sales to construction and automotive industries. Tariff-induced input cost increases affected manufacturing across many districts, with firms reporting difficulty planning due to changing tariff policies. Labor shortages due to immigration policy changes also constrained production in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Manufacturing was disrupted mainly by trade- and cost-related supply chain problems, and these fed through directly into production decisions and outcomes.\n\n1. **Tariffs and trade-policy uncertainty → higher costs and weaker orders → constrained production**\n- This was caused by **higher tariffs** on imported inputs and ongoing **uncertainty about trade policy**.\n- As a result, manufacturers in several districts faced **tariff-driven cost increases** on “raw materials, imported components, and chemical inputs” and reported **challenging conditions** in manufacturing due to “higher tariffs and waning overall demand.”\n- This was caused by these higher costs making production more expensive and by customers pulling back due to trade tensions.\n- As a result, some firms reported **flat or weaker orders**, and in at least one case (Cleveland) orders from industrial and agricultural equipment producers were about **25% below previous expectations**, which implies **slower or reduced production schedules**, even when not always described as explicit “cuts.”\n\n2. **High steel prices → temporary shutdown of a keg manufacturer**\n- This was caused by a sharp rise in **steel prices**, which is a critical input for metal products.\n- As a result, **an upstate New York manufacturer of kegs temporarily ceased production** specifically “due to high steel prices.” Here the supply chain disruption (input price shock) translated directly into a **production stoppage** at a particular plant.\n\n3. **Difficulty procuring equipment and materials → worsened supply availability → pressure on inventories and output**\n- This was caused by disruptions in the availability of equipment and materials, some of which were linked to tariffs and trade frictions.\n- As a result, manufacturers—particularly in the New York District—reported:\n  - **“Some difficulty procuring equipment and materials,”**\n  - **Worsened supply availability**, and\n  - **Shrinking inventories**.\n- This was caused by inputs not arriving as reliably or as plentifully as before, even though reported delivery times were “little changed.”\n- As a result, firms had to **run down inventories** to keep operating, which **constrained their ability to sustain production** and left them more vulnerable to any further disruption, potentially affecting their capacity to fulfill orders going forward.\n\n4. **Combined effect: cost pressures + supply constraints + weaker demand → production under strain**\n- This was caused jointly by:\n  - Higher tariffs and input prices (including steel),\n  - Greater difficulty obtaining materials and equipment, and\n  - Trade-related uncertainty weighing on demand.\n- As a result:\n  - Some firms **halted production temporarily** (the keg manufacturer),\n  - Many manufacturers experienced **weaker orders** and **challenging conditions**, which likely led to **slower production runs and cautious capacity use**, and\n  - Shrinking inventories and worsened supply availability **tightened the operational leeway** manufacturers had, increasing the risk of future production bottlenecks or fulfillment problems if disruptions persisted.\n\nIn summary: Supply chain disruptions—driven by tariffs, higher input prices (especially steel), and difficulties sourcing equipment and materials—raised production costs, reduced orders, and directly interrupted output in at least one case. As a result, manufacturing production was squeezed from both the cost side (more expensive, harder-to-get inputs) and the demand side (weaker orders tied to trade uncertainty), leaving firms operating under tighter constraints and, in some instances, temporarily stopping production altogether.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements of the expected answer:\n1) Geographic variation across districts.\n2) San Francisco: higher costs for utilities and imported semiconductor chips.\n3) Chicago: modest decline in manufacturing demand; fabricated metals unchanged overall with sectoral offsets (higher in some sectors, lower in construction and auto).\n4) Tariff-induced input cost increases across many districts, with planning difficulties due to changing tariff policies.\n5) Labor shortages from immigration policy changes constraining production in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer correctly captures tariff-induced input cost increases and trade-policy uncertainty as major supply chain disruptions and links them to higher costs and weaker orders. This aligns partially with point (4), though it does not explicitly mention firms’ difficulty planning due to changing tariff policies.\n- It adds details (e.g., Cleveland orders down 25%, New York keg manufacturer shutdown, difficulty procuring equipment and materials, shrinking inventories) that are not in the expected answer but are not stated to be false. However, since we judge against the expected answer alone, these extra details are essentially irrelevant rather than clearly correct.\n- The system answer does NOT mention:\n  • The specific San Francisco issues: utilities and imported semiconductor chips.\n  • The specific Chicago pattern: modest decline in demand, fabricated metals unchanged with sectoral offsets.\n  • Labor shortages due to immigration policy changes constraining production in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture.\n  • Explicit planning difficulty due to changing tariff policies (only general “uncertainty” is mentioned).\n\nThere are no direct contradictions with the expected answer, but several key expected elements are missing. The answer focuses heavily on tariffs, input prices, and procurement difficulties while omitting the geographic variations, semiconductor/utility issues, Chicago sector-specific effects, and immigration-related labor constraints. That makes it incomplete relative to the ground truth, though not factually wrong.\n\nTherefore the best classification is that it is incomplete but not misleading: PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

      "expected_answer": "Several service-related costs drove input cost increases: insurance, health care, and technology solutions all saw higher costs. In New York, rising business costs including insurance added to financial pressures for community service providers. Employer-sponsored health insurance expenses saw outsized increases, intensifying labor cost pressures across districts. These service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.",
      "system_answer": "Below is a side‑by‑side comparison of (1) which **service-related costs** drove input cost increases and (2) how these affected **different sectors**.\n\n---\n### 1. Types of service‑related input costs\n\n**Insurance**  \n- **Broadly (National Summary):** Higher business and liability insurance costs were one of the key service inputs pushing up overall input costs across sectors. [National Summary > Prices, BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- **Cleveland banking & professional/business services:** Contacts “continued to report elevated costs for … **insurance**.” [Cleveland > Prices]\n\n**Health care / employee health benefits**  \n- **Broadly (National Summary):** Rising health‑care costs are cited as a major service input raising input costs. [National Summary > Prices]  \n- **Minneapolis (many firms including manufacturers):** Firms reported “significant increases in … **employee health care premiums** for the coming year,” contributing to higher input costs for more than half of respondents. [Minneapolis > Prices]\n\n**Technology and technology solutions**  \n- **Broadly (National Summary):** The higher cost of “**technology solutions**” raised input costs across multiple industries. [National Summary > Prices]  \n- **Cleveland banking & professional/business services:** These sectors specifically reported **elevated technology costs** in addition to insurance. [Cleveland > Prices]\n\n**Utilities / electricity**  \n- **Minneapolis (many sectors, including manufacturing):** “Significant increases in **electricity rates**” were cited as a contributor to rising input costs. [Minneapolis > Prices]  \n- **Cleveland manufacturing:** Manufacturers reported **rising utilities costs** as an important input cost pressure. [Cleveland > Prices]\n\n---\n### 2. Which sectors bore these costs most directly?\n\n**Banking & Professional / Business Services**  \n- **Exposure:** Heavily exposed to **technology and insurance** cost increases.  \n  - Cleveland: “Banking and professional and business services contacts continued to report elevated costs for **technology and insurance** …” [Cleveland > Prices]  \n- **Mechanism:** These sectors depend heavily on IT systems, software, cybersecurity, and professional liability and other insurance, so higher service prices translate directly into higher overhead.\n\n**Manufacturing**  \n- **Exposure to service costs:**  \n  - Cleveland: Manufacturers reported **rising utilities costs**, a key service input. [Cleveland > Prices]  \n  - Minneapolis: Significant **electricity** and **health‑care premium** increases affected many firms, including manufacturers. [Minneapolis > Prices]  \n  - National: Higher costs for **insurance, health care, and technology solutions** also fed into manufacturers’ overall input cost base. [National Summary > Prices]\n- **Additional exposure to tariffs/import costs (not services but intertwined):**  \n  - National: Tariff‑ and import‑driven input cost increases were reported across many Districts, with manufacturers sometimes fully passing these on. [National Summary > Prices]  \n  - Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, New York, Atlanta, Boston all recorded tariff‑related pressures affecting manufacturers. [Cleveland > Prices; Richmond > Prices; Minneapolis > Prices; New York > Manufacturing and Distribution; Atlanta > Manufacturing; Boston > Manufacturing and Related Services]\n\n**Retail**  \n- **Exposure to service costs:**  \n  - In the cited excerpts, retail is **not** singled out for elevated insurance/technology/health‑care costs. The service‑input discussion is largely general at the national level. [National Summary > Prices]\n- **Dominant cost driver instead:**  \n  - Cleveland: Retail contacts highlighted **tariff‑driven cost increases on vehicles, beef, coffee, and chocolate**, i.e., goods/commodity costs rather than service inputs. [Cleveland > Prices]  \n  - National: Retail trade is discussed mainly in relation to **import (tariff) costs** and their pass‑through to customers. [National Summary > Prices]\n\n**Other service‑sector firms (general services)**  \n- **Exposure:**  \n  - National: Service firms are part of the broad group facing higher **insurance, health care, and technology** costs. [National Summary > Prices]  \n  - Richmond: Service‑sector firms note tariffs raising input costs; however, specific service‑input categories (insurance, tech, health care) are not broken out in the Richmond text provided. [Richmond > Prices]\n\n**Summary of exposure differences**  \n- **More directly exposed to service‑input costs:** Banking; professional & business services; manufacturers (notably via utilities and health benefits).  \n- **More exposed to tariff/commodity costs than to documented service‑input costs:** Retail (Cleveland and national examples).  \n- **Service sectors outside finance/professional services:** Affected by tariffs and, in aggregate, by higher insurance/health‑care/tech costs, but less precisely documented sector‑by‑sector in the excerpts.\n\n---\n### 3. How higher service‑related input costs affected sectors\n\n#### A. Effects on pricing and margins\n\n**Manufacturing**  \n- **Raising prices / surcharges:**  \n  - National: Some manufacturing firms “fully” passed higher import costs to customers. [National Summary > Prices]  \n  - Cleveland: Several manufacturers introduced **surcharges** to cover additional costs related to tariffs; across industries, firms raised prices to cover elevated input costs (which, for manufacturers, include higher utilities and other services). [Cleveland > Prices]  \n  - Minneapolis: Several manufacturers increased prices “in response to tariffs” or planned to do so; about one‑fifth of firms overall raised selling prices month‑over‑month. [Minneapolis > Prices]\n- **Absorbing costs selectively:**  \n  - Cleveland: Some manufacturers chose to **hold prices steady** despite higher costs to try to gain market share, indicating margin compression for these firms. [Cleveland > Prices]\n- **Production and activity:**  \n  - New York: Manufacturers faced elevated input prices and procurement difficulties; one keg manufacturer temporarily **ceased production** due to high steel prices (tariff‑linked). [New York > Manufacturing and Distribution]  \n  - Atlanta and Boston: Manufacturers reported tariffs and rising costs as key headwinds in their outlook. [Atlanta > Manufacturing; Boston > Manufacturing and Related Services]\n\n**Banking & Professional / Business Services**  \n- **Pricing response (Cleveland):**  \n  - Cleveland notes that across industries, contacts implemented **price increases to cover elevated input costs**. Given that banking and professional/business services explicitly report higher technology and insurance costs, they are among the sectors likely raising fees/prices to recoup these service‑input increases, although specific fee percentages are not given. [Cleveland > Prices]\n- **Margins:**  \n  - Where these firms could not fully pass costs through, higher tech and insurance expenses would compress margins, but the excerpts do not quantify the extent of absorption vs. pass‑through.\n\n**Retail**  \n- **Pricing response:**  \n  - National: Some retail firms were able to **fully pass higher import costs** to customers. [National Summary > Prices]  \n  - Cleveland: Many retail contacts reported offering **discounts** or raising prices only on select items, suggesting weaker pricing power despite higher costs. [Cleveland > Prices]\n- **Contrast vs. service sectors and manufacturing:**  \n  - While manufacturers and some service sectors (banking/professional) are documented as raising prices broadly to cover higher service and tariff costs, retailers appear more constrained, passing through costs selectively and relying on promotions, with their primary cost shock coming from tariffs/commodities rather than explicitly from service inputs.\n\n**Other services (Richmond and national context)**  \n- **Richmond:** Service firms noted tariffs adding to input costs; some planned price increases after working through pre‑tariff inventories, indicating delayed pass‑through. [Richmond > Prices]  \n- **National:** Service firms are part of the broad group affected by higher insurance, health care, and tech costs; the National Summary also notes some firms keeping selling prices largely unchanged to preserve market share, implying that some service providers absorbed higher costs. [National Summary > Prices]\n\n#### B. Broader operational and strategic effects\n\n**Manufacturing**  \n- **Investment and outlook:**  \n  - New York: Capital spending plans were “soft,” with tariffs and shifting trade dynamics weighing on activity. [New York > Manufacturing and Distribution]  \n  - Boston: Manufacturing outlook headwinds related to tariffs, inflation, and uncertainty. [Boston > Manufacturing and Related Services]  \n  - These effects reflect a more cautious stance on investment and operations in an environment of higher input (including service) costs and tariff uncertainty, though the excerpts do not directly tie this only to service inputs.\n\n**Service sectors (banking, professional, general services)**  \n- **Cost structure:**  \n  - For banking and professional/business services in Cleveland, cost structures are being reshaped by higher recurring **technology and insurance** expenses. [Cleveland > Prices]  \n  - Nationally, rising health‑care and insurance costs increase labor‑related overhead for many service firms, pressuring profitability when fees cannot rise commensurately. [National Summary > Prices]\n\n**Retail**  \n- **Competitive and pricing pressure:**  \n  - With cost increases dominated by tariffs and commodities and customers highly price‑sensitive, many retailers respond with selective price increases and discounting, implying tighter margins and limited ability to offset cost shocks, whether from goods or services. [Cleveland > Prices; National Summary > Prices]\n\n---\n### 4. Direct comparison by sector\n\n**Main cost channels**  \n- **Banking & professional services:** Primarily hit by higher **technology** and **insurance** costs; also exposed to rising **health‑care** benefits at the national level. [Cleveland > Prices; National Summary > Prices]\n- **Manufacturing:** Hit by **utilities/electricity**, **health‑care**, and other service costs, plus **tariff/import‑driven** materials costs; this combination materially raises their total input cost base. [Cleveland > Prices; Minneapolis > Prices; National Summary > Prices]\n- **Retail:** Costs framed mainly around **tariffs and commodities**; specific service‑input pressures (insurance/tech/health care) are not highlighted in the cited text. [Cleveland > Prices; National Summary > Prices]\n\n**Ability to pass on higher costs**  \n- **Manufacturing:** Often able to raise prices, sometimes fully passing on costs or adding surcharges, though some firms hold prices to gain share. [National Summary > Prices; Cleveland > Prices; Minneapolis > Prices]\n- **Banking & professional services:** Evidence from Cleveland suggests they are among the “contacts” raising prices to cover input costs, but details are less explicit than for manufacturers. [Cleveland > Prices]\n- **Retail:** More constrained; some full pass‑through of import costs is reported nationally, but many Cleveland retailers rely on discounts and selective price hikes to remain competitive. [National Summary > Prices; Cleveland > Prices]\n\n**Impact on activity and outlook**  \n- **Manufacturing:** Higher service and tariff costs, combined with weaker demand in some cases, contribute to **cautious investment**, soft capital spending, and isolated production cutbacks (e.g., temporary shutdown of a keg manufacturer). [New York > Manufacturing and Distribution; Boston > Manufacturing and Related Services]\n- **Service sectors:** Face ongoing margin pressure from rising tech, insurance, and health‑care costs, with mixed ability to adjust prices; specific activity cuts are not detailed in the excerpts. [Cleveland > Prices; National Summary > Prices]\n- **Retail:** Squeezed between higher cost of goods and intense price competition, leading to narrower margins but with no explicit mention of output or employment cuts in the cited text. [Cleveland > Prices]\n\nIn sum, higher service‑related costs—insurance, health care, technology solutions, and utilities—were broadly important but **most clearly and directly documented for banking and professional services (technology and insurance) and for manufacturers (utilities, health care, and related services)**. Retailers, by contrast, are portrayed as primarily struggling with **tariff and commodity cost shocks**, with less explicit emphasis on service‑input cost pressures in the available passages, and with more limited ability to raise prices than many manufacturers and some service firms.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the expected answer:\n1) Service-related costs that contributed to input cost increases were: insurance, health care, and technology solutions.\n2) In New York, rising business costs including insurance added to financial pressures for community service providers.\n3) Employer-sponsored health insurance expenses saw outsized increases, intensifying labor cost pressures across districts.\n4) These service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer clearly identifies the main service-related costs: insurance, health care (employee health benefits), and technology/technology solutions. It also adds utilities/electricity, which is extra detail but not contradictory.\n- It correctly describes that these service-related costs raised input costs across sectors, especially banking/professional services and manufacturing, and notes that tariffs and import costs (goods) were another major input-cost driver. That aligns with the expected note that service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.\n- However, the expected answer has two specific points that are not captured:\n  • New York: rising business costs including insurance adding to financial pressures for community service providers. The system answer discusses New York mainly in the context of manufacturing (capital spending, tariffs, steel prices) and does not mention community service providers or that particular New York detail.\n  • Employer-sponsored health insurance expenses showing “outsized increases” and intensifying labor cost pressures “across districts.” The system answer does mention health care / employee health benefits and that they are a major input cost, but it does not explicitly characterize them as outsized relative to other costs or as intensifying labor cost pressures across districts; it localizes the concrete example mostly to Minneapolis and speaks more generally at the national level.\n- Nothing in the system answer directly contradicts the expected answer; it’s just more detailed and somewhat broader than required, and it omits some specific sectoral/locational nuances (New York community service providers, explicit framing of employer-sponsored health insurance as especially large and labor-cost focused).\n\nGiven that the core list of service-related inputs and the co-occurrence with tariff-driven goods costs are correctly captured, but some key contextual details about New York service providers and the specific characterization of employer-sponsored health insurance increases are missing, the answer is accurate but not fully complete relative to the expected answer.\n\nTherefore, the best classification is that it is partially correct rather than fully correct.",

      "question": "Which retail categories saw gains versus declines, and how does this reflect consumer behavior patterns?",
      "expected_answer": "In Chicago, leisure and hospitality sales were mixed. Categories seeing gains included restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments, as well as new light vehicle sales which were brisk due to strong underlying demand and the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases. Categories seeing softness included travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels. Used vehicle sales remained steady though dealerships in low-to-moderate income communities reported softer demand. This pattern reflects consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.",
      "system_answer": "Below is a side‑by‑side comparison of the **retail categories that gained vs. those that declined**, and what these shifts say about **consumer behavior patterns**. \n\n---\n\n### 1. Autos and Vehicles\n\n**Gaining categories**\n- New vehicles, especially EVs:\n  - Atlanta and Chicago saw **surges in new auto and EV sales** tied to the impending expiration of an EV tax credit. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Used and lower‑priced vehicles:\n  - Cleveland and other districts reported **strong demand for used cars and family sedans**, indicating a move toward lower price points within autos. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Declining / softer categories**\n- Some automotive goods in certain districts (earlier accounts for Kansas City) were reported as **moderately weaker**, though the exact mix is less consistently documented across all excerpts. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Consumer behavior pattern reflected**\n- Where EVs rose, purchases were **timed around incentives**: consumers pulled forward big‑ticket buys ahead of tax‑credit expiration, showing sensitivity to policy‑driven price changes. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Strong used‑car and sedan demand shows **“trading down” within the category**—people still need cars, but are choosing **cheaper options** when there’s no special incentive to buy new or premium vehicles. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n---\n\n### 2. Restaurants and Food Service\n\n**Gaining categories**\n- Quick‑service and value‑oriented dining:\n  - Richmond and Chicago reported **strong or increased spending at fast food, fast casual, and family dining restaurants**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Nationally, these formats held up better than higher‑priced dining.\n- Higher‑end / luxury restaurants:\n  - Richmond noted **solid growth at luxury restaurants**, supported by higher‑income households. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Declining / softer categories**\n- Casual sit‑down restaurants and higher‑ticket extras:\n  - Richmond contacts pointed to **softening at casual sit‑down restaurants**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Atlanta noted diners **skipping desserts and alcoholic beverages**, trimming the more discretionary parts of the meal. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Consumer behavior pattern reflected**\n- Spending is not collapsing but **re‑mixing**:\n  - Households keep eating out, but **shift toward lower‑priced formats** (fast food/fast casual) and **trim add‑ons** (desserts, alcohol) instead of eliminating restaurant visits altogether. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Higher‑income consumers behave differently:\n  - **Luxury restaurants remain strong**, indicating that affluent households are **less constrained** and continue to pay for premium experiences. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n---\n\n### 3. General Retail Goods and Everyday Items\n\n**Gaining categories**\n- Selected home‑related and tech goods:\n  - Chicago saw **strong increases in appliances, computers, and landscaping‑related spending**—often functional or upgrade‑oriented purchases. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Richmond cited **strong sales at a replacement window company**, as homeowners invest in existing homes. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Declining / softer categories**\n- Overall non‑auto retail and general merchandise:\n  - Cleveland, Atlanta, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Kansas City, and Minneapolis reported **slight declines or softness in non‑auto retail**, with lower foot traffic and weaker unit sales. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Everyday consumer goods and lower‑priced items (San Francisco account):\n  - Softer demand for **food products, beverages, clothing, and pet supplies**, with reports that **more affordable goods weakened** even as luxury held up. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Consumer behavior pattern reflected**\n- **Selective spending, not across‑the‑board cuts**:\n  - Consumers are still willing to spend on **targeted, functional upgrades** (appliances, computers, home improvements) but **pull back on routine discretionary goods** and some everyday items. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Heightened **price sensitivity**:\n  - Multiple districts describe shoppers as more **“value aware,” deal‑driven, and promotion‑sensitive**, indicating that discounts and sales increasingly dictate where and when purchases occur. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n---\n\n### 4. Housing‑Related Retail\n\n**Gaining categories**\n- Renovation and replacement products:\n  - Richmond noted **strong sales in replacement windows**, and Chicago saw increased **landscaping spending**, as households invest in their current homes. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Declining / softer categories**\n- Furniture and home goods tied to new construction:\n  - Richmond reported **softer furniture sales** and weak activity for firms tied to **new home construction**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Consumer behavior pattern reflected**\n- **Shift from moving to improving**:\n  - Instead of buying new homes and furnishing them, consumers are **renovating or upgrading existing homes**, consistent with a cautious environment (higher borrowing costs, uncertainty) and a desire to stretch value from current assets. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n---\n\n### 5. Travel, Tourism, and Hospitality\n\n**Gaining / relatively resilient categories**\n- Local, lower‑ticket leisure:\n  - Chicago reported **increased spending at restaurants** (fast food, fast casual, family dining) even while some travel‑related categories weakened. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Declining / softer categories**\n- Travel, tourism, and hotels:\n  - The national summary and districts like Minneapolis and Cleveland reported **declining demand from international travelers**, lower hotel occupancy, and weaker tourism activity (e.g., a Cleveland contact noted a **50% drop in Canadian visitors**). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Chicago cited **softness in airlines and hotels**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Consumer behavior pattern reflected**\n- Preference for **close‑to‑home, lower‑cost experiences**:\n  - Consumers appear to be **trading down from travel** (especially international or air travel with hotel stays) to **local, cheaper leisure options like dining out nearby**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Economic and policy uncertainty (including tariffs and inflation noted in Boston’s manufacturing contacts) also contribute to **caution about big, discretionary travel spending**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n---\n\n### 6. Luxury vs. Mass‑Market Segments\n\n**Gaining categories**\n- Luxury goods and luxury travel/experiences:\n  - San Francisco reported continued strength in **luxury goods and athletic footwear**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - The national summary highlighted **strong luxury travel and accommodation spending** by higher‑income households. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Richmond saw **solid growth at small higher‑end retailers and luxury restaurants**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Declining / softer categories**\n- More affordable and mid‑market goods:\n  - San Francisco described **weaker demand for more affordable goods** (e.g., food products, beverages, clothing, pet supplies), even while luxury demand held up. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Many districts reported **softness in mainstream non‑auto retail**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Consumer behavior pattern reflected**\n- Clear **bifurcation by income**:\n  - Higher‑income consumers remain willing to spend on **luxury retail, high‑end restaurants, and premium travel**, while lower‑ and middle‑income households become more **value‑constrained and discount‑oriented**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- This split explains why **luxury categories can gain even as mass‑market categories decline**: the two groups are reacting differently to the same macro environment.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Electronics, Building Materials, and Other Durables (Chicago Detail)\n\n**Gaining categories (Chicago)**\n- **Appliances, computers, landscaping**: Chicago reports **strong increases** in these categories, alongside a healthy back‑to‑school season. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Declining categories (Chicago)**\n- **Other consumer electronics and building materials**: Spending in these areas **declined** despite overall modest growth in consumer spending. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Consumer behavior pattern reflected**\n- **Reallocation within durables**:\n  - Households are **prioritizing functional and productivity‑enhancing items** (appliances, computers) while cutting back on less essential electronics and home‑improvement materials. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- This indicates **budget management and prioritization**, not a blanket pullback from all durable goods.\n\n---\n\n### Cross‑Cutting Consumer Behavior Themes\n\nPutting the gains and declines side‑by‑side across categories shows several overarching patterns:\n\n1. **Value orientation and price sensitivity**\n   - Gains in **used cars, quick‑service dining, discount‑driven retail, and renovation over new builds** vs. declines in travel, casual sit‑down restaurants, and nonessential goods point to consumers trying to **stretch dollars**, hunting for **deals**, and **downshifting within categories** instead of quitting them. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. **Trading down vs. cutting out**\n   - From **new autos → used cars**, **casual sit‑down → fast casual/fast food**, and **new homes → home improvements**, consumers are **staying in the market but at lower price points or lower commitment levels**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n3. **Bifurcation by income**\n   - Luxury categories (high‑end retail, luxury travel, luxury dining) show **continued gains**, while mid‑market and budget categories often soften, revealing a **growing gap between affluent and constrained consumers**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n4. **Incentive and timing effects**\n   - Spikes in EV and auto sales ahead of **expiring tax credits** show that big‑ticket purchases are highly **responsive to temporary incentives and perceived future price increases**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n5. **Caution amid broader uncertainty**\n   - Reported headwinds from **tariffs, inflation, and economic uncertainty** contribute to weaker spending on travel, tourism, and some discretionary durables, even as certain essential or value‑oriented niches gain. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nTaken together, the side‑by‑side shifts—who is gaining (value, incentives, and luxury niches) versus who is declining (mid‑market, travel, and nonessential goods)—paint a picture of consumers who are **cautious and value‑driven overall**, while **higher‑income households continue to spend robustly** in premium segments.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "The question and ground truth are narrowly focused on Chicago: gains in fast food/fast casual/family dining and brisk new light vehicle sales (driven by strong demand and end of EV tax incentives), versus softness in travel-related categories (airlines, hotels) and steady but softer used-vehicle demand in low‑ to moderate‑income areas. Interpretation: consumers seek value in dining while cutting back on travel.\n\nThe system answer:\n- Does mention Chicago in several places, but mixes in many other districts and many categories not in the ground truth.\n- For autos: it talks about new vehicles, especially EVs, with surges in Atlanta and Chicago tied to impending expiration of an EV tax credit. That only partially matches: the ground truth says new light vehicle sales were brisk due to strong demand AND the end of tax incentives for EVs, but the system emphasizes EVs, multiple districts, and does not clearly state this for Chicago light vehicles broadly.\n- It states “used and lower‑priced vehicles” saw strong demand, whereas the ground truth says used vehicle sales remained steady and that in low‑ to‑moderate income communities demand was softer. That’s a direct contradiction.\n- For restaurants: it does include that Chicago saw increased spending at fast food, fast casual, and family dining. That matches the gains portion.\n- For travel/hospitality: it does say Chicago cited softness in airlines and hotels. That matches the declines portion.\n- Consumer behavior interpretation: it broadly captures the idea of trading down, value orientation, and preference for local, lower‑ticket leisure vs travel, which is consistent with the ground truth’s “seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.”\n\nHowever, the strong (not steady/soft) characterization of used vehicle demand conflicts with the expected answer, and much of the content is extraneous to the specific Chicago question. Because there is at least one clear factual contradiction about used vehicle sales, the answer cannot be considered fully correct. It is not merely incomplete; it asserts the opposite pattern for used vehicles.\n\nThus the verdict is INCORRECT.",

In Dallas (Eleventh District), drilling and well completion activity was flat. Nationally, energy activity was generally down among reporting districts. The Chicago District noted higher energy prices as part of nonlabor cost increases affecting manufacturers.",
      "system_answer": "Below is a side‑by‑side comparison by District, focusing on (1) how energy sector performance differed and (2) what specific activities were mentioned in each case.\n\n---\n\n**Overall National Context**  \n- Performance: Nationally, “activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts.” [National Summary – Overall Economic Activity]  \n- Activities: The national summary does not list specific energy activities by District; those appear only in District sections.\n\n---\n\n### Atlanta (Sixth District)\n\n**Performance**  \n- In Atlanta, energy activity **expanded/grew moderately**, standing out against the generally weaker national backdrop. [Atlanta – Summary of Economic Activity; BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Specific activities mentioned**  \n- Most energy segments **grew at a moderate pace**. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- **Crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico** was described as strong. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- **LNG exports** were robust. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- **Electricity demand** was solid, especially from **commercial and industrial** customers. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- **Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects** were advancing. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- **Solar development** was slowing. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Contrast with others**  \n- Unlike Kansas City and Minneapolis, where activity declined, and Dallas, where it was flat, Atlanta was one of the few Districts reporting **broadly expanding** energy activity.\n\n---\n\n### Kansas City (Tenth District)\n\n**Performance**  \n- In Kansas City, **oil and gas activity fell modestly**. [Kansas City – Energy]  \n- Firms reported **declining revenues and profits**, and **capital expenditures declined further**. [Kansas City – Energy]\n\n**Specific activities mentioned**  \n- **Drilling activity**: Nearly two‑thirds of contacts reported **steady drilling**, while the rest reported **declines**. [Kansas City – Energy]  \n- **Rig counts**:  \n  - Rigs **rose in Colorado and Wyoming**.  \n  - Rigs **decreased slightly in Oklahoma**, partly tied to lower natural gas spot prices. [Kansas City – Energy]  \n- **Breakeven prices**:  \n  - Oil prices remained slightly above profitable levels.  \n  - Some firms reported **lower breakeven prices** due to reduced regulatory compliance costs. [Kansas City – Energy]  \n- **Outlook for natural gas**: Contacts expected **natural gas prices to reach breakeven within the year**, but **not high enough to support a substantial increase in drilling**. [Kansas City – Energy]\n\n**Contrast with others**  \n- Compared with **Atlanta’s moderate expansion**, Kansas City showed a **modest downturn** with clear financial stress (falling revenues, profits, and capex).  \n- Relative to **Dallas**, where drilling/completions were flat, Kansas City showed **more evident decline** in overall activity, even though some rig counts were up in specific states.\n\n---\n\n### Dallas (Eleventh District)\n\n**Performance**  \n- In Dallas, **drilling and well completion activity was flat**. [Dallas – Energy]  \n- The District highlighted **pressure from low oil prices** and noted concern that without a material price increase, **U.S. crude production would erode in 2026**. [Dallas – Energy]\n\n**Specific activities mentioned**  \n- **Drilling and well completions**: Activity was **flat** over the past six weeks. [Dallas – Energy]  \n- **Breakeven costs**: **Rising** due to higher input costs. [Dallas – Energy]  \n- **Rigs**: An oilfield services contact noted **“a lot of rigs stacked in yards waiting to become spare parts,”** indicating significant idle capacity. [Dallas – Energy]  \n- **Project delays**: Several firms reported **project delays** driven by **low oil prices and an uncertain policy environment**. [Dallas – Energy]  \n- **Pipelines**: Pipeline contacts were **optimistic** about their project pipelines, citing **regulatory relief and favorable tax policies**. [Dallas – Energy]  \n- Broader energy‑related themes in the report also include **oil field services** and **pipeline projects** as part of the regional energy ecosystem. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Contrast with others**  \n- Compared with **Kansas City**, Dallas shows **flat activity** rather than modest decline, but faces **rising breakeven costs** instead of Kansas City’s falling breakevens from regulatory relief.  \n- Compared with **Atlanta**, Dallas lacks broad growth: it has **stagnant drilling/completions, idle rigs, and delayed projects**, versus Atlanta’s expanding production, exports, and CCS.  \n- Relative to **Minneapolis**, which simply reports a decrease, Dallas provides a more nuanced picture of a **plateau with mixed signals** (flat drilling, rising costs, idled rigs, but some midstream optimism).\n\n---\n\n### Minneapolis (Ninth District)\n\n**Performance**  \n- In Minneapolis, **energy activity decreased** at the District level. [Minneapolis – Summary of Economic Activity]\n\n**Specific activities mentioned**  \n- The Minneapolis section does **not** break out which specific components—such as drilling, production, investment, or employment—drove the decline. It only states that **overall energy activity decreased**. [Minneapolis – Summary of Economic Activity]\n\n**Contrast with others**  \n- Unlike Atlanta (expansion) and Dallas (flat activity), Minneapolis reports a **clear contraction** but with **limited detail**.  \n- Compared with Kansas City, which specifies drilling, rig counts, and financial metrics, Minneapolis offers only a **high‑level decline** with **no activity‑level granularity**.\n\n---\n\n### Boston (First District)\n\n**Performance**  \n- The cited Boston material (Manufacturing and Related Services) does **not** mention the energy sector at all. [Boston – Manufacturing and Related Services]\n\n**Specific activities mentioned**  \n- **None** in the provided excerpts; no energy‑specific activities or performance metrics are given for Boston.\n\n**Contrast with others**  \n- In contrast to Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and Minneapolis—which all provide at least some energy performance information—Boston’s cited section offers **no insight** into regional energy sector conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Cross‑District Comparison of Key Energy Activities\n\nTo directly compare **what was happening** in energy across Districts:\n\n- **Drilling & Rigs**  \n  - Atlanta: No explicit drilling/rig counts noted; focus is more on production and demand. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - Kansas City: **Mostly steady or declining drilling**; **rigs up** in Colorado and Wyoming, **down slightly** in Oklahoma. [Kansas City – Energy]  \n  - Dallas: **Drilling and well completions flat**; **many rigs stacked and idle**. [Dallas – Energy]  \n  - Minneapolis: Drilling/rig specifics not provided; only that **energy activity decreased**. [Minneapolis – Summary of Economic Activity]\n\n- **Production and Exports**  \n  - Atlanta: **Strong crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico** and **robust LNG exports**. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - Kansas City: Focus is on activity and profitability rather than explicit production levels. [Kansas City – Energy]  \n  - Dallas: Discussion centers on concerns that **production will erode in 2026** without higher prices; current production is referenced in an outlook context. [Dallas – Energy]  \n  - Minneapolis: No production‑specific details. [Minneapolis – Summary of Economic Activity]\n\n- **Prices, Costs, and Breakevens**  \n  - Atlanta: No explicit breakeven or cost discussion in the cited text.  \n  - Kansas City: Oil prices slightly above profitable levels; **breakeven prices falling** for some firms due to **reduced regulatory compliance costs**. [Kansas City – Energy]  \n  - Dallas: **Breakeven costs rising** because of **higher input costs**; low oil prices causing concern and project delays. [Dallas – Energy]  \n  - Minneapolis: No price or breakeven commentary. [Minneapolis – Summary of Economic Activity]\n\n- **Investment & Projects**  \n  - Atlanta: **Advancing CCS projects** and **slowing solar development** reflect mixed investment momentum in low‑carbon energy. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - Kansas City: **Capital expenditures declined further**, with uncertainty cited as a headwind. [Kansas City – Energy]  \n  - Dallas: **Project delays** (upstream or related) due to low prices and policy uncertainty, but **pipeline projects** benefited from regulatory and tax support, leading to optimism in that segment. [Dallas – Energy]  \n  - Minneapolis: No explicit project or capex detail beyond the overall decline. [Minneapolis – Summary of Economic Activity]\n\n- **Power & Demand‑Side Activity**  \n  - Atlanta: **Solid electricity demand**, especially from commercial and industrial customers. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  - Other Districts: The provided excerpts do not emphasize electricity demand.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Variation**  \n- **Atlanta**: Outlier on the upside—**moderate expansion** across multiple energy segments, including strong offshore oil and LNG exports, solid power demand, advancing CCS, and only solar slowing.  \n- **Kansas City**: **Modest decline**—oil and gas activity down, drilling mostly steady to down, mixed rig trends by state, falling breakevens from regulatory relief but declining revenues, profits, and capex.  \n- **Dallas**: **Flat** operational activity—drilling and completions unchanged, but with **rising costs, idle rigs, and delayed projects**, partially offset by optimism in pipelines.  \n- **Minneapolis**: **Decreasing** overall energy activity with no detail on sub‑components.  \n- **Boston**: No energy‑sector information in the cited text, so no performance or activity comparison is possible.\n",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements of the expected answer:\n1) Variation across districts: \n   - Atlanta (Sixth): energy grew moderately and was a positive outlier.\n   - Dallas (Eleventh): drilling and well completion activity was flat.\n   - Nationally: energy activity generally down among reporting districts.\n   - Chicago: higher energy prices noted as part of nonlabor cost increases for manufacturers.\n2) Specific activities mentioned: \n   - Dallas: drilling and well completion activity.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer correctly states that nationally “activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts,” matching the national context.\n- For Atlanta, it correctly describes energy activity expanding/growing moderately and explicitly highlights it as an upside outlier vs generally weaker national conditions, matching and elaborating on the expected answer.\n- For Dallas, it explicitly notes that drilling and well completion activity was flat and discusses related details (breakeven costs, rigs stacked, project delays, pipeline projects), which is consistent with and extends the expected answer.\n- It further discusses Kansas City, Minneapolis, and Boston, which are not required by the ground truth but are not in conflict and stay within the document context.\n- However, the expected answer specifically mentions the Chicago District’s note that higher energy prices were part of nonlabor cost increases affecting manufacturers. The system answer does not mention Chicago at all, so that key point is missing.\n- There are no factual contradictions with the ground truth content; the answer is more detailed but still aligned where it overlaps.\n\nBecause one of the key facts in the expected answer (the Chicago reference) is missing, while the rest is accurate and often more detailed, the answer is incomplete but not wrong or misleading.\n\nVerdict: PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

Consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.",
      "system_answer": "Below is a district‑by‑district, side‑by‑side comparison of consumer versus business lending conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Chicago District**  \n- **Consumer lending:** Consumer loan demand increased slightly, with some pickup in mortgage refinancing; loan quality was flat. Rates edged down, but terms tightened slightly—so pricing eased a bit while nonprice conditions became more restrictive. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Business lending:** Business loan demand decreased slightly on net, with modestly declining loan quality (notably among auto industry suppliers). Business loan rates moved down but lending terms tightened. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Comparison:** Consumer lending was somewhat more resilient—demand up slightly and quality stable—while business lending softened, with weaker demand and some deterioration in quality. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n---\n\n**Philadelphia District**  \n- **Consumer lending:** Consumer lending (excluding autos and credit cards) rose strongly. Home equity lines increased moderately, auto loans rose modestly, and mortgages saw a slight uptick, while credit card volumes decreased modestly. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Business lending:** Overall business lending declined moderately, led by a continued strong decline in commercial and industrial (C&I) lending and a modest decline in commercial real estate loans. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Comparison:** Consumer lending showed broad-based growth (outside credit cards), whereas business lending contracted, indicating relatively stronger conditions and demand on the consumer side than for businesses. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n---\n\n**Richmond District**  \n- **Consumer lending:** Overall loan demand was stable, but banks reported a modest increase in delinquencies in consumer portfolios, including mortgages and home equity loans, pointing to emerging credit-quality concerns among households. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Business lending:** Financial institutions saw generally stable demand for most loan types, with some contacts noting a modest increase in commercial loan demand. Many business borrowers, however, stayed on the sidelines awaiting more certainty about the economy and interest rates. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Comparison:** Demand was roughly stable for both sectors, but stress appeared greater on the consumer side due to rising delinquencies, while business lending showed pockets of modest strengthening in demand. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n---\n\n**Atlanta District**  \n- **Consumer lending:** Consumer loan demand was muted, and overall consumer lending contracted further, despite a small uptick in home equity line of credit (HELOC) applications. Credit quality remained generally healthy, though delinquencies ticked up. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Business lending:** Loan demand from corporate borrowers was muted amid economic uncertainty, contributing to flat overall loan growth in the district. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Comparison:** Both consumer and business loan demand were subdued, but consumer lending actually declined while business lending was roughly flat, implying relatively weaker conditions for consumers than for corporate borrowers. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n---\n\n**St. Louis District**  \n*(Only business lending conditions described in the provided material.)*\n- **Consumer lending:** Not specifically described in the supplied excerpts. \n- **Business lending:** Overall banking activity was unchanged with moderate loan demand. One banker reported strong commercial loan demand and optimism tied to falling rates, while another reported depressed small business credit demand but a rebuilding pipeline. Banks tightened standards, increasing scrutiny of small business loans and raising equity requirements. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Comparison:** A direct consumer‑vs‑business comparison is not possible from the given text; available information focuses on business credit, which showed moderate but uneven demand and tighter standards.

      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "The question and expected answer focus on differences between consumer vs business lending in Kansas City, Chicago, Dallas, and St. Louis, with specific points: (1) Kansas City – optimistic 2026 expectations but moderate deterioration in consumer loan portfolios (household stress). (2) Chicago – business loan demand decreased slightly while consumer loan demand increased slightly via mortgage refi. (3) Dallas – overall loan demand grew. (4) St. Louis – banking activity unchanged, strong overall credit conditions; consumer stress signs, business conditions mixed.\n\nThe system answer instead:\n- Discusses Chicago, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and St. Louis (and gives only business info for St. Louis), omitting Kansas City and Dallas entirely.\n- For Chicago, it correctly captures the consumer vs business contrast, which matches part of the expected answer.\n- It adds multiple districts (Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta) not mentioned in the ground truth and gives detailed conditions for them, which are not required by the question.\n- For St. Louis, it says consumer lending is not described and cannot compare, whereas the ground truth explicitly states that “Consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.” This directly contradicts the expected answer.\n- It provides no information at all on Kansas City and Dallas, which are part of the key facts.\n\nThus, while one piece (Chicago) aligns, the answer both omits required district information (Kansas City, Dallas; and consumer side of St. Louis) and contradicts the ground‐truth description of St. Louis consumer conditions. That makes the overall answer factually wrong with respect to the expected answer, not simply incomplete. Therefore the correct verdict is INCORRECT.",

      "expected_answer": "In Dallas, price pressures were subdued in services but remained elevated in the manufacturing sector. In Richmond, price growth remained moderate overall despite some pickup in price growth in the manufacturing sector. In Chicago, producer prices grew moderately with contacts reporting moderate nonlabor cost increases including energy and raw materials. Manufacturing contacts attributed some raw materials price increases to tariffs, suggesting tariffs disproportionately affected goods-producing sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Manufacturing vs. Services: Price Pressures\n\n1. Overall Intensity\n- Manufacturing: Price pressures were consistently stronger, with both input and selling prices described as strong or elevated across several districts. Manufacturing prices also more fully reflected tariff and input-cost shocks in current pricing. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- Services: Price pressures were generally moderate or subdued, with more stable price dynamics and, in some cases, little change in price growth. Services had not yet passed through cost increases to the same extent, though some firming was expected. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n2. Input Costs\n- Manufacturing: Input prices in manufacturing rose at a strong pace, especially where tariffs and higher materials costs were prominent. These cost pressures were immediate and visible in firms’ reports. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- Services: Input cost increases in services were more moderate, and cost pass-through was more gradual. Service firms reported fewer direct tariff effects and less acute input-cost pressure. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n3. Selling Prices (Current)\n- Manufacturing: Selling prices increased more sharply, with several districts noting strong or elevated growth in output prices. For example, in Dallas, manufacturing selling prices were rising notably, driven in part by tariffs and higher input costs. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- Services: Selling prices in services showed only moderate or subdued increases; in some areas there was virtually no change in price growth. In Dallas and Kansas City, service-sector price increases were clearly weaker than those in manufacturing. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n4. Expectations for Future Prices\n- Manufacturing: Manufacturers in places like Kansas City expected selling price growth to remain strong or even accelerate from already elevated levels, suggesting that high cost pressures would continue to be passed through. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- Services: Service firms generally anticipated some future firming from a lower base. For example, in Dallas and Atlanta, services businesses expected selling prices to pick up over the next 12 months as they gained more room to pass through accumulated cost increases, but from currently moderate/subdued levels. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n5. Role of Tariffs and External Cost Shocks\n- Manufacturing: Tariffs and other input-cost shocks were a central driver of manufacturing price pressures. Richmond and Dallas specifically tied stronger manufacturing price growth to tariff-related increases in materials and components. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- Services: Tariffs played a much smaller direct role in service-sector pricing. Services experienced more indirect or gradual effects (e.g., higher purchased services or goods), resulting in less pronounced and slower-moving price pressures compared with manufacturing. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\nSummary\n- Manufacturing faced stronger, more immediate, and more tariff-sensitive price pressures, with both input and selling prices rising sharply.\n- Services experienced gentler, more stable, and generally moderate/subdued price increases, with expectations of some future firming but from a much lower level than in manufacturing.

      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the expected answer:\n1) Dallas: price pressures subdued in services but elevated in manufacturing.\n2) Richmond: overall price growth moderate, with some pickup in manufacturing price growth.\n3) Chicago: producer prices grew moderately, with moderate nonlabor cost increases (energy, raw materials).\n4) Manufacturing contacts attributed some raw materials price increases to tariffs, implying tariffs disproportionately affected goods-producing sectors.\n\nSystem answer:\n- States generally that manufacturing price pressures were stronger and services more moderate/subdued.\n- Explicitly mentions Dallas, saying manufacturing selling prices were rising notably and that service-sector price increases were weaker than manufacturing.\n- Mentions Richmond and Dallas tying stronger manufacturing price growth to tariff-related increases.\n- Describes tariffs and input-cost shocks as a central driver of manufacturing price pressures, and that tariffs played a much smaller direct role in services.\n\nComparison:\n- The Dallas contrast (subdued services vs elevated manufacturing) is captured in substance: it clearly states manufacturing had stronger price pressures and that service-sector price increases were weaker; this aligns with the ground truth.\n- The answer does not mention Richmond’s “overall moderate” price growth nor the nuance of “some pickup” in manufacturing prices there; it only references Richmond in the context of tariffs, which is directionally consistent but misses the moderation nuance.\n- Chicago is not mentioned at all, so the details about producer prices growing moderately and the specific role of energy and raw materials there are missing.\n- The role of tariffs disproportionately affecting goods-producing sectors is captured and expanded on correctly.\n\nThere are no clear factual contradictions with the expected answer, but the answer omits key locale-specific details for Richmond (moderate overall, some pickup) and entirely omits Chicago. It provides a broadly correct, higher-level comparison but is incomplete relative to the expected answer.\n\nThus, the answer is accurate where it speaks, but missing significant parts of the expected content, so it is partially correct rather than fully correct.",

      "question": "How did hiring patterns change, and what does this indicate about employer confidence?",
      "expected_answer": "Employers showed cautious hiring behavior: More employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. Those still hiring favored temporary and part-time workers over full-time employment. In Boston, both hiring and layoffs increased modestly, indicating churn rather than net growth. Employment in IT services increased modestly with hiring in sales and technical positions - a relative bright spot. Jobseekers in Cleveland reported offers were more likely to be part-time with little or no benefits. This pattern indicates employer uncertainty and reluctance to commit to permanent workforce expansion.",
      "system_answer": "Hiring patterns shifted from expansion to caution, and this change both reflected and reinforced a drop in employer confidence.\n\n1. What changed in hiring patterns\n- Employers moved from growth hiring to maintenance or contraction.\n  - This was caused by weaker demand in many sectors and heightened economic uncertainty. As a result, most firms are hiring mainly to replace departures rather than to grow headcount, and some are actively reducing staff via layoffs and attrition.\n- Firms became more selective and slower to fill roles.\n  - This was caused by a desire to limit long‑term commitments in an uncertain environment. As a result, vacancies stay open longer or are left unfilled, and employers use natural attrition to slim workforces.\n- There was a shift toward temporary, part‑time, and temp‑to‑hire positions.\n  - This was caused by lower confidence in future demand and a wish to retain flexibility if conditions worsen. As a result, firms avoid direct, full‑time hires and rely more on contingent labor instead of expanding permanent staff.\n- Entry‑level and lower‑skill roles were curtailed or automated.\n  - This was caused by both tighter cost control and growing adoption of AI and automation. As a result, demand for many routine or entry‑level positions fell, while hiring continued more selectively in areas like financial services, insurance, and IT/technical sales.\n- Evidence from workers’ side shows fewer openings and reduced hours.\n  - This was caused by employers’ hiring chill and slower turnover. As a result, job fairs had fewer participating employers, and employees saw reduced hours and less job hopping, consistent with decelerating—though not collapsing—hiring demand.\n\n2. What this indicates about employer confidence\n- Preference for replacement hiring over expansion indicates cautious confidence.\n  - This was caused by employers’ uncertainty about future sales and profits. As a result, they are willing to sustain current operations but reluctant to bet on strong growth by adding permanent headcount.\n- Increased use of temp/part‑time roles signals risk aversion.\n  - This was caused by fears that demand may weaken further or that costs could rise. As a result, firms keep labor more “variable,” so they can scale down quickly without the financial and legal costs of cutting permanent staff.\n- Holding unspent hiring budgets and delaying decisions shows hesitation, not inability.\n  - This was caused less by a lack of candidates and more by strategic caution. As a result, even when companies have budget room and can find workers, they postpone commitments until the economic outlook is clearer.\n- Coupling staff cuts with AI investments shows a belief that future operations can run leaner.\n  - This was caused by expectations that technology and productivity gains will offset the need for many traditional roles. As a result, firms feel less pressure to maintain or grow headcount, reinforcing their willingness to keep hiring muted.\n\nOverall, the move from growth to replacement hiring, the tilt toward temporary and part‑time roles, slower filling of vacancies, and selective cuts to entry‑level positions were all caused by weaker demand, economic uncertainty, and evolving technology. As a result, these hiring patterns indicate that employer confidence has shifted from optimistic expansion toward guarded, risk‑averse maintenance of current operations rather than bold workforce growth.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n- Employers showed cautious hiring behavior and more employers reduced headcount via layoffs and attrition.\n- Those still hiring favored temporary and part‑time workers over full‑time.\n- In Boston, both hiring and layoffs increased modestly, indicating churn rather than net growth.\n- Employment in IT services increased modestly with hiring in sales and technical positions as a relative bright spot.\n- In Cleveland, jobseekers reported more part‑time offers with little or no benefits.\n- Overall this indicates employer uncertainty and reluctance to commit to permanent workforce expansion.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer clearly captures the overarching theme: a shift from expansion to caution and risk‑averse, maintenance‑focused hiring, indicating lower employer confidence and reluctance to commit to permanent headcount. This aligns with the expected conclusion about uncertainty and reluctance to expand permanently.\n- It correctly describes more layoffs and attrition and a move toward temporary and part‑time roles instead of full‑time, which matches the core pattern in the expected answer.\n- It also notes selective bright spots in IT/technical sales, which loosely aligns with “Employment in IT services increased modestly with hiring in sales and technical positions.”\n\nMissing/extra details:\n- The system answer does not mention the specific regional evidence about Boston (modest increases in both hiring and layoffs indicating churn) or Cleveland (more part‑time offers with little/no benefits).\n- It introduces several elements not in the ground truth, such as slower vacancy filling, increased automation/AI displacing entry‑level roles, job fairs with fewer employers, and holding unspent hiring budgets. These are not supported by the expected answer and go beyond it, but they do not directly contradict the ground truth.\n- No clear factual contradictions with the ground truth are evident; the additions are somewhat speculative but not directly at odds with the expected description.\n\nBecause the central facts (cautious hiring, more layoffs/attrition, shift to temp/part‑time, bright spot in IT/sales, and implication of reduced confidence/reluctance to expand permanently) are represented, but some specific supporting details (Boston and Cleveland regional nuances) are missing and there is substantial extra, unsupported elaboration, the answer is best classified as incomplete but directionally accurate.\n\nThus the answer is not fully correct, but it captures most key ideas without clear factual errors relative to the expected answer.",

Financial conditions loosened slightly (better than mixed national picture). Construction/real estate increased slightly (better than mixed national). Farm income prospects unchanged. Compared to national trends, Chicago showed relative strength in financial conditions, construction, and consumer spending while manufacturing weakness aligned with broader trends.",
      "system_answer": "Below is a side‑by‑side comparison of the key Chicago (Seventh District) indicators and the closest available national context from the October 15, 2025 Beige Book and other district highlights. Where only Chicago data are available and no true national aggregate is given, that limitation is stated explicitly.\n\n---\n### Overall Economic Activity\n- **Chicago (Seventh District):** Economic activity was **flat / little changed**, and contacts **expected a slight decrease** in activity over the next year. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **National context:** Other districts show a **mixed but subdued pattern**:\n  - Philadelphia: business activity **increased slightly**.\n  - New York: activity **declined slightly**.\n  - Kansas City: activity **fell slightly**.\n  Together, these descriptions imply a **low‑momentum national backdrop** with small increases or decreases, making Chicago’s **flat** reading broadly in line but on the weaker side relative to districts reporting slight growth. A single, quantitative national growth figure is **not** provided in the Beige Book excerpts. [Sub‑Query 5]\n\n---\n### Consumer Spending\n- **Chicago:** **Increased modestly**, indicating moderate demand. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **National context:**\n  - New York: **consumer spending increased modestly**.\n  - Philadelphia: overall nonmanufacturing activity (which includes most consumer‑facing sectors) **increased slightly**.\n  This places Chicago’s **modest increase** in consumer spending as broadly consistent with **modest to slight gains** seen in other districts; no numerical national consumption measure is provided. [Sub‑Query 3, 5]\n\n---\n### Construction and Real Estate Activity\n- **Chicago:** **Increased slightly** in construction and real estate activity. No breakdown is given on home prices, rents, or inventories in the excerpt. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **National context:**\n  - Dallas: commercial real estate **improved**, with better office leasing and solid industrial/retail, but investment sales remained limited and outlooks cautious.\n  The Beige Book text provided does **not** include a national housing or construction summary or house‑price indices, so Chicago’s **slight increase** can only be said to be directionally similar to some other districts’ **improvement**, within a generally cautious national real‑estate environment. [Sub‑Query 3, 5]\n\n---\n### Employment\n- **Chicago:** **Flat** employment over the period. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **National context:**\n  - Philadelphia: employment **increased slightly**.\n  - New York: employment **held steady**.\n  - Kansas City: employment **fell slightly**.\n  Chicago’s **flat** employment is squarely within this national range of very small changes, but slightly weaker than districts where employment was **rising** modestly (e.g., Philadelphia). No aggregate national payroll number is given in the Beige Book excerpts. [Sub‑Query 3, 5]\n\n---\n### Nonbusiness (Nonprofit / Public‑Sector) Activity\n- **Chicago:** **No change** – “nonbusiness contacts saw no change in activity.” [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **National context:**\n  - Philadelphia: activity **increased slightly for nonmanufacturers**, which includes many service and some nonprofit/public‑related activities.\n  Chicago’s nonbusiness sector was **flat**, while at least some other districts saw **slight increases**; there is no distinct national nonbusiness aggregate in the excerpts. [Sub‑Query 3]\n\n---\n### Business Spending / Investment\n- **Chicago:** **Declined slightly** – business spending (including capital expenditures) eased back. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **National context:**\n  - Boston: manufacturing capital expenditures were **unchanged**.\n  The limited evidence suggests a **cautious national investment climate** (unchanged or slightly down), with Chicago on the **slightly weaker** side (small decline versus flat). No national capex aggregate is provided. [Sub‑Query 3, 5]\n\n---\n### Manufacturing Activity\n- **Chicago:** **Declined modestly**, indicating softening in the industrial sector. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **National context:**\n  - Philadelphia: manufacturing activity **increased moderately**.\n  - New York: manufacturing activity was **little changed** after a prior uptick.\n  - Boston: manufacturing sales **rose modestly**, with capex unchanged and uncertainty elevated.\n  Compared with these, Chicago’s manufacturing sector **underperformed**: it was **declining** while several other districts reported **flat to modest growth**. There is no single, aggregated national manufacturing descriptor in the excerpts, only these district snapshots. [Sub‑Query 3, 5]\n\n---\n### Prices (Inflation)\n- **Chicago:** **“Prices rose moderately.”** No explicit split between consumer vs. producer prices or nonlabor input costs is given. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **National context:**\n  - Philadelphia: “prices continued to **rise moderately**.”\n  - Kansas City: prices rose at a **moderate** pace.\n  This shows that **moderate price increases** were common across multiple districts, with Chicago’s inflation pressures **in line** with this broader pattern. Quantitative national inflation measures (e.g., CPI, PPI) are **not** part of the Beige Book excerpts. [Sub‑Query 3, 5]\n\n---\n### Wages\n- **Chicago:** **“Wages were up modestly.”** [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **National context:**\n  - Philadelphia: wages “again rose at **modest pre‑pandemic rates**.”\n  - New York: wage growth remained **modest**.\n  Chicago’s **modest wage growth** closely matches other districts’ experience; wage pressures appear **broadly similar nationally**, at modest rates. No national wage index is cited. [Sub‑Query 3, 5]\n\n---\n### Financial Conditions / Credit\n- **Chicago:** **“Financial conditions loosened slightly,”** indicating somewhat easier access to credit and financing in the district. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **National context:**\n  - New York: “overall loan demand **declined**.”\n  - Kansas City: consumer loan portfolios **deteriorated moderately**.\n  - Dallas: investment sales activity remained **limited**, pointing to cautious financing conditions in real estate.\n  Relative to these, Chicago’s **slightly looser** financial conditions suggest **somewhat easier credit** locally than in districts experiencing weaker loan demand or deteriorating portfolios, but there is no formal national financial conditions index in the excerpts to quantify this. [Sub‑Query 3, 5]\n\n---\n### Farm Income / Agriculture\n- **Chicago:** “**Prospects for 2025 farm income were unchanged**,” implying a stable outlook for the agricultural sector. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **National context:**\n  The provided Beige Book excerpts do **not** include a national or cross‑district agriculture summary for this period, so Chicago’s **unchanged** farm‑income prospects **cannot be systematically compared** with a documented national trend using the available text. [Sub‑Query 3]\n\n---\n### Energy Sector (if considered)\n- **Chicago:** The excerpt only notes that **overall activity was little changed** and contacts expected a **slight decrease in activity over the next year**; it does **not** separately discuss energy. Any energy implications are embedded in this general outlook. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **National context:**\n  The excerpts provided contain **no explicit energy‑sector commentary** for other districts or for the nation, so no direct comparison is possible.\n\n---\n### Overall Assessment: Chicago vs. National Backdrop\n- **Chicago in summary:**\n  - Flat overall activity; flat employment;\n  - Modest gains in **consumer spending** and **construction/real estate**;\n  - Slight decline in **business spending** and **modest decline in manufacturing**;\n  - **Moderate price increases** and **modest wage gains**;\n  - **Slightly looser** financial conditions;\n  - **Unchanged** farm‑income outlook.\n- **Relative to national trends (as seen through other districts):**\n  - Chicago’s **overall and labor‑market conditions** are in the same “low‑change” band as other districts (slight up, slight down, or flat), but somewhat weaker than districts showing slight growth (e.g., Philadelphia).\n  - On **manufacturing**, Chicago is weaker than districts where manufacturing was stable or growing (Philadelphia, Boston, parts of New York).\n  - On **prices and wages**, Chicago’s **moderate price** and **modest wage** increases are clearly **in line** with the broader pattern across multiple districts.\n  - On **credit/financial conditions**, Chicago appears **somewhat easier** than some districts reporting falling loan demand or deteriorating portfolios, though the absence of a national index limits precision.\n\nBecause the Beige Book is qualitative and the provided excerpts do not include full national aggregates, we can compare **directions and relative strength**, but not provide comprehensive numerical national benchmarks for each indicator.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n- Overall economic activity in Chicago: little changed; matches national “little change on balance.”\n- Consumer spending: increased modestly; stronger than national where it “inched down.”\n- Manufacturing: demand declined modestly; aligned with national challenging conditions.\n- Employment: flat; in line with nationally stable levels.\n- Wages and benefits: up modestly; matches national modest‑to‑moderate.\n- Prices: rose moderately; in line with national rising trend.\n- Financial conditions: loosened slightly; somewhat stronger than mixed national picture.\n- Construction/real estate: increased slightly; somewhat stronger than mixed national.\n- Farm income prospects: unchanged.\n- Comparative summary: Chicago relatively stronger in financial conditions, construction, and consumer spending; manufacturing weakness aligned with broader trends.\n\nNow compare to the system answer:\n- It correctly states for Chicago: overall activity little changed, consumer spending increased modestly, manufacturing declined modestly, employment flat, wages up modestly, prices rose moderately, financial conditions loosened slightly, construction/real estate increased slightly, farm income prospects unchanged. All these Chicago‑specific indicators match the ground truth.\n- For comparison to national trends, the system describes: \n  * Overall activity: Chicago flat within a low‑momentum national backdrop – compatible with “little change on balance.”\n  * Consumer spending: says Chicago’s modest increase is “broadly consistent” with modest/slight gains in other districts. This diverges from the expected answer, which says national consumer spending “inched down,” making Chicago relatively stronger. However, this is not directly contradicting a stated national figure; it’s just a different comparison and more granular across districts.\n  * Manufacturing: system says Chicago underperformed relative to several districts that were flat or growing, whereas ground truth says Chicago’s manufacturing weakness aligned with broader national challenging conditions. This is a mild mismatch in emphasis (system paints Chicago as weaker than some districts instead of aligned), but not an outright factual error, just a different synthesis.\n  * Employment: described as flat, within a range of small changes across other districts – consistent with “stable” nationally.\n  * Wages and prices: explicitly in line with other districts’ moderate/modest increases – matches expected answer’s comparison.\n  * Financial conditions: notes that Chicago’s financial conditions loosened slightly and are somewhat easier than in some other districts – consistent with expected answer’s “relative strength.”\n  * Construction/real estate: Chicago increased slightly; system cautiously says directionally similar to some improvement elsewhere in a cautious environment. Expected answer frames this as relatively stronger than “mixed” national; system doesn’t clearly highlight “stronger” but doesn’t contradict it either.\n\nNo clear factual errors about Chicago’s own indicators; all the listed Chicago indicators and directions match. The differences lie in interpretation of how Chicago compares to national trends, particularly in consumer spending and manufacturing. The system doesn’t assert any specific national aggregate that is wrong; it instead uses other district descriptions to build a composite picture. This makes the comparison somewhat different from the expected summary, but not factually incorrect based on what’s in the prompt; it’s just more granular and slightly different in emphasis.\n\nAll key Chicago indicators and most of the comparative relationships (wages, prices, employment, financial conditions, construction, farm income) are present and correct. The only divergence is that the system does not clearly state that Chicago consumer spending and construction are stronger than national; instead it treats them as broadly consistent. That’s an issue of completeness/interpretation rather than factual inaccuracy.\n\nGiven that: the answer captures all key indicators correctly and provides a reasonable, if somewhat different, national comparison. It is more complete than incomplete and not misleading on facts, so it fits best under CORRECT rather than PARTIALLY_CORRECT.\n",
