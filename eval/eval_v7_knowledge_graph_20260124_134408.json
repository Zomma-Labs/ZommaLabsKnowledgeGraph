[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### Sector-by-sector evolution (drivers of the slight decline)\n- **Retail trade:** **Decreased somewhat**, contributing to the overall softening; contacts noted some **demand softening** alongside cost pressures. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Residential real estate:** **Decreased somewhat**; parts of **Northern California** saw **easing prices**, with **inventories rising** and homes spending **longer on the market**\u2014a shift toward softer housing conditions.

      "question": "What boosted auto sales in some districts?",
      "expected": "Auto sales were boosted in some Districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September.",
      "answer": "Auto sales were boosted in some Federal Reserve Districts primarily by **pull-forward demand for electric vehicles (EVs)** and, in a few places, by **improving market conditions and dealer support factors**.\n\n- **Pull-forward EV demand ahead of the federal EV tax credit expiration (end of September) \u2192 higher/steadier auto sales**: This was caused by consumers rushing to buy EVs before the tax credit expired, which in turn lifted overall auto sales (or prevented a bigger decline) in multiple Districts. The Beige Book\u2019s national summary explicitly notes that auto sales were boosted in some Districts by strong EV demand ahead of the tax credit expiration. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15] \n  - **Atlanta (Sixth District)**: A \u201crobust surge\u201d in new EV sales ahead of the expiration boosted sales. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - **Boston / New Hampshire (First District)**: Auto sales increased modestly, driven by the \u201crush to purchase electric vehicles\u201d before tax credits expired. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - **Chicago (Seventh District)**: New light vehicle sales were brisk due to strong underlying demand, with the end of EV tax incentives contributing to briskness (consistent with pull-forward buying). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - **Philadelphia (Third District)**: Sales \u201cwould have fallen by more\u201d if not for a rush to buy EVs before the credit expired\u2014i.e., the rush mitigated downside and supported sales. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Normalization after tariff-related volatility earlier in the year \u2192 slight sales uptick**: In Upstate New York, sales edged up as conditions normalized following earlier tariff-related volatility. This suggests improving stability contributed to better sales performance (reported as an observed association in dealer commentary). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Healthy inventories and solid demand \u2192 ability to convert demand into sales**: In the Second District, dealers cited solid demand and healthy inventory levels alongside slightly higher sales. This indicates inventories likely helped meet demand, supporting sales outcomes (correlational as presented). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Increased incentives/promotions \u2192 supporting demand and sales**: In Philadelphia, contacts reported increased auto incentives amid broader discounting. These incentives plausibly helped sustain purchases, supporting sales levels (again described as contextual support rather than a quantified causal estimate).

      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The key expected point is that auto sales were boosted by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September. The agent clearly states this as the primary driver (pull-forward EV demand before the tax credit expired) and ties it to multiple districts, which matches the expected answer. However, the agent also introduces several additional purported factors (normalization after tariff volatility, healthy inventories, incentives/promotions) as boosting auto sales. These extra causes go beyond the expected answer and are not supported by the prompt; presenting them as additional primary reasons makes the response only partially aligned with the expected, narrowly defined answer.",

The report clearly links tariffs to metals prices; the downstream effect on demand is suggestive rather than explicitly proven.

      "answer": "## Overall trend in employment levels (chronological)\n\n### **Recent weeks leading up to Oct. 15, 2025 (Beige Book period)**\n- **Nationally, employment was \u201clargely stable,\u201d** with **labor demand \u201cgenerally muted.\u201d** The dominant pattern was not expansion, but **cautious staffing**\u2014many firms hired mainly to **backfill/replacement** roles rather than add net new positions. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### **During the Oct. 15, 2025 Beige Book reporting window (cross-District snapshot)**\n- The most common District-level description was **flat/steady/unchanged** employment (e.g., Atlanta \u201cgenerally flat,\u201d San Francisco \u201clittle changed on net,\u201d Boston \u201cflat overall,\u201d Chicago \u201cflat,\u201d Richmond \u201cunchanged,\u201d St. Louis \u201cunchanged\u201d). This indicates **no broad-based rise in employment** during the period. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- Where employment moved, it was usually described as **\u201cslight\u201d** rather than large:\n  - **Slight increases**: Philadelphia and Cleveland reported **slight** employment gains. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - **Slight declines**: Kansas City (\u201cfell/declined slightly\u201d) and Minneapolis (\u201cflat to slightly down\u201d / \u201cdown slightly\u201d) pointed to mild weakening, including some evidence of reduced hours even when terminations were infrequent. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - **Clearer decline/outlier**: Dallas reported employment **fell/dipped**, including continued headcount declines in energy and trimming in some other sectors. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### **Turning point / transition within the same period: stable headline, softer undertone**\n- Even with \u201cstable\u201d aggregate readings, the Beige Book notes an important shift in *how* firms maintained staffing: **more employers reported lowering headcounts via layoffs and attrition** (often citing weaker demand and uncertainty, and in some cases AI-related investment), while others leaned more on **temporary/part-time** staffing. This suggests employment was **stable but increasingly softening at the margin**, with more downside actions than upside expansion. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### **Forward-looking signal (late 2025 into early 2026)**\n- Some contacts indicated postponed hiring/backfilling (e.g., a St. Louis manufacturer delaying role-filling until **Q1 2026**), reinforcing the picture of **muted hiring momentum** rather than accelerating job growth. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## Synthesis\nFrom the weeks leading up to and including **Oct. 15, 2025**, employment levels were **broadly flat overall, with a mild tilt toward weakening**\u2014most Districts reported little net change, a few saw slight gains, but several saw slight declines and Dallas reported a clearer drop.

      "answer": "Labor cost pressures intensified mainly because employers faced both higher nonwage compensation costs and tighter effective labor supply, which in turn pushed up total labor expenses.\n\n- **Benefit costs rose sharply (especially health insurance), which directly increased labor costs.** The Beige Book reports labor cost pressures \u201cintensified\u2026due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses,\u201d with contacts specifically citing higher health insurance premiums. As a result, even if base wages were not accelerating everywhere, employers\u2019 all-in labor costs increased. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Labor availability tightened in some sectors due to immigration policy/enforcement, which reduced supply and pushed up pay.** Multiple Districts noted labor supply strains and shortages\u2014particularly in hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing\u2014linked to immigration policy changes and enforcement; contacts cited workers not reporting to work due to fear of deportation.

[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Union contract outcomes lifted wages in parts of health care, which raised sector-specific labor costs.** A contact reported health-care wages rose \u201cas a result of recent labor union contract negotiations.\u201d This is a direct causal channel from bargaining outcomes to higher compensation costs for affected employers. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Hard-to-fill roles sustained wage pressure, which kept labor costs elevated despite broader easing elsewhere.** The report indicates that even where overall wage pressures softened, employers still faced persistent pressure to pay more for highly specialized positions (e.g., AI technology) and some lower-wage construction and manufacturing roles. This suggests ongoing, role-specific scarcity that required higher compensation to attract/retain workers. (This is consistent with causation via scarcity, though the text describes it as persistent pressure rather than quantifying the resulting increases.) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Certain industries continued to post notable wage increases, which mechanically increased labor costs in those segments.** For example, nearly three-quarters of hospitality and tourism firms reported wage increases of 3% or more; this would directly raise labor expenses for firms in that sector.

[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Tariffs/import duties and pass-through:** **Tariff-related increases in input costs** were widely reported, but pass-through differed: some firms **held selling prices largely unchanged** due to price-sensitive customers/market-share concerns, while others (notably in **manufacturing and retail**) **passed higher import costs through to customers**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Mixed price movements in specific materials/services:** Weakening demand contributed to some **declines in certain material prices**, including **steel (Sixth District)** and **lumber (Twelfth District)**, even as other costs rose. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Illustrative District examples:**\n  - **Cleveland:** selling prices rose **modestly**, but pricing power was constrained; many retailers used **discounts** or selective increases. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - **New York:** selling prices rose **moderately** while input prices rose **strongly**, with some firms implementing **multiple price hikes** linked to tariff costs. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - **San Francisco:** prices rose **modestly**; retailers passed a sizable share of higher import-duty costs to consumers, though restaurants faced resistance to menu-price increases. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - **Kansas City:** prices grew **moderately**; manufacturing input prices rose **strongly**, and manufacturers expected selling-price growth to **accelerate** in coming quarters. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\nIn short, the October 2025 period featured **continued moderate inflation in selling prices**, **stronger (often tariff-related) pressure on input costs**, and **more discounting/limited pass-through where demand was softer**.

      "question": "What caused input costs to increase at a faster pace?",
      "expected": "Input costs increased at a faster pace due to higher import costs and the higher cost of services such as insurance, health care, and technology solutions.",
      "answer": "Input costs increased at a faster pace because several major cost pressures intensified at the same time, with tariff-related import costs and widening pass-through dynamics as the central accelerants.\n\n- **Higher import costs from tariffs/import duties \u2192 directly raised prices for many inputs \u2192 accelerating overall input inflation.** The Beige Book\u2019s national summary explicitly ties the faster pace of input-cost increases to **\u201chigher import costs\u201d** and reports tariff-induced increases across many Districts [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. District contacts linked tariffs to higher prices for **raw materials, imported components, chemical inputs** (Cleveland) and **metals such as aluminum, copper, and steel** (Chicago), as well as more widespread increases in imported supplies (San Francisco) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. This also included specific imported industrial inputs like **semiconductor chips** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n- **Tariff-related supply-chain behaviors \u2192 broadened and amplified price increases beyond directly tariffed goods \u2192 further sped up input-cost growth.** Contacts reported that **some suppliers cited tariffs when raising prices even when goods were not subject to increased levies**, which would expand the scope of increases and push the overall pace higher [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. Separately, **dwindling inventories of pre-tariff goods** reduced firms\u2019 ability to rely on cheaper stock, and businesses reported an **inability to keep absorbing tariff-related costs**, which in turn led to more of the cost shock being realized in current input prices [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n- **Rising utilities/energy costs \u2192 increased operating and production inputs \u2192 added to the acceleration.** Multiple Districts reported rising energy-related expenses, including **significant increases in electricity rates** (Minneapolis) and higher utilities/energy costs cited by manufacturers (Cleveland, Chicago) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. As these costs rose alongside tariff-related increases, they contributed to the faster overall pace.\n\n- **Higher costs for essential business services (insurance, health care, technology) \u2192 raised non-material input costs \u2192 reinforced the faster pace.** The national summary cites accelerating input costs due in part to higher service costs such as **insurance, health care, and technology solutions** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. Philadelphia provided concrete examples\u2014e.g., a **15% year-over-year increase in liability insurance** and **nearly 10% higher health-care costs**\u2014cited alongside tariffs and utilities as drivers of stronger cost pressure [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n- **Policy/administrative factors \u2192 sometimes expanded tariff exposure unexpectedly \u2192 increased costs more broadly than anticipated.** One report noted customs **applying steel and aluminum tariffs to products that did not contain those metals**, which would mechanically raise costs beyond the expected set of tariffed inputs [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n- **Other local policy costs \u2192 increased the cost of doing business in specific cases \u2192 added upward pressure (more localized).** For example, New York cited **congestion pricing** as considerably raising costs for a specialty contractor [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n**Causation vs. correlation:** The Beige Book directly attributes (\u201ccaused by\u201d) the faster pace primarily to **higher import costs (tariffs/duties)** and also cites concurrent increases in **utilities/energy** and **service input costs (insurance/health care/technology)** as key contributors [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. Items like supplier \u201ctariff-citing\u201d behavior, depleted pre-tariff inventories, and congestion pricing are reported mechanisms or examples that plausibly **amplified** the acceleration; the text supports them as contributing factors, though their magnitude is not quantified [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].",

      "question": "How did tariffs affect prices across districts?",
      "expected": "Tariff-induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts, but the extent of those higher costs passing through to final prices varied. Some firms kept selling prices unchanged to preserve market share, while others fully passed higher import costs to customers.",
      "answer": "Tariffs affected prices across Federal Reserve Districts mainly by **raising input costs**, which **caused** firms to either **raise final selling prices** or **absorb/mitigate costs** depending on local demand conditions, inventory buffers, and customer resistance. The Beige Book emphasizes a broad pattern: **tariff-induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts, but the degree of pass-through to final prices varied**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## Economy-wide cause \u2192 effect pattern\n- **Cause:** Higher tariffs/import duties increased costs for **raw materials and imported components** across many regions. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Effect:** Firms faced a choice:\n  - **Pass through** those higher costs into **higher selling prices** (more common where demand allowed, or where surcharges were used). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - **Absorb/offset** costs (more common where customers were price-sensitive or demand was soft), using tactics like discounts, selective price hikes, recipe/portion changes, or supplier absorption. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Constraint/modifier:** In some places, **weaker demand** pushed down certain materials prices (e.g., steel in the Sixth District; lumber in the Twelfth), which **partly counteracted** tariff-driven pressures\u2014this is an offsetting influence rather than tariffs directly lowering prices. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## How this played out by District (tariffs \u2192 prices)\n### First District (Boston / Northeast)\n- **Cause:** Tariff-related cost pressures contributed to moderate price increases. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Effect:** **Smaller manufacturers passed through a larger share** of tariff-driven cost increases, **which led to higher customer prices** in those segments. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Limiting factor:** Restaurants faced rising costs but kept **menu prices mostly unchanged**, **which implies absorption** rather than pass-through in that sector. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### Second District (New York)\n- **Cause:** Tariffs raised costs on specific inputs/products (e.g., an auto parts importer affected by tariffs on goods from India; concerns about coffee tariffs from Brazil). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Effect:** Firms **restructured pricing** (including item-by-item pricing based on demand elasticity), and there were concrete examples of pass-through\u2014e.g., an upstate specialty appliance manufacturer **raised prices again** to cover tariff impacts; a brewer passed higher ingredient/packaging costs to consumers. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Countervailing behavior:** A pharmaceutical contact noted **foreign manufacturers absorbing tariff costs** to maintain market share, **which reduced pass-through** in that case. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### Third District (Philadelphia / Mid-Atlantic)\n- **Cause:** Tariff-driven cost pressures increased as pre-tariff inventory buffers began to shrink. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Effect:** Many consumer-facing businesses often **could not pass through all cost increases**, **which led to more discounting** and references to lower hotel room rates and increased incentives on autos and newly built homes. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Forward-looking mechanism:** Contacts expected tariff effects to intensify as **pre-tariff inventories dwindled**, **which would make absorption harder and could increase future pass-through**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### Fourth District (Cleveland / Great Lakes)\n- **Cause:** Tariffs were frequently cited as drivers of robust nonlabor input-cost increases (raw materials, imported components, chemical inputs; and retail items like vehicles, beef, coffee, chocolate). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Effect:** Many manufacturers/wholesalers added **tariff-related surcharges**, **which directly raised transaction prices** for buyers in those channels. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Limiting factor:** Demand weakness and price sensitivity constrained broader price increases, **which led retailers to discount** or raise prices only selectively; in some instances foreign producers **cut prices to offset tariffs**, dampening final-price increases. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### Fifth District (Richmond / Southeast)\n- **Cause:** Manufacturers and service firms continued to cite tariffs adding to input costs. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Effect:** Manufacturing price growth **picked up** with firms citing tariffs (though overall year-over-year price growth remained moderate); a furniture manufacturer noted tariffs **increasing their prices** despite weak demand. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Timing element:** Some costs were **not yet passed through** because firms were working through pre-tariff inventory, **which delayed** observed final-price increases. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### Sixth District (Atlanta / Southeast)\n- **Cause:** Tariff pressures interacted with weak demand (e.g., steel prices down in the district due to weaker demand, which partially offset other cost pressures). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Effect:** Contacts used mixed strategies\u2014absorbing, negotiating, and passing through\u2014and warned pass-through \u201chas just begun\u201d and could lift prices into **2026**; auto manufacturers in some cases **absorbed** costs to avoid further demand declines. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### Seventh District (Chicago / Midwest)\n- **Cause:** Manufacturing contacts attributed higher metals input prices (aluminum, copper, steel) to tariffs. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Effect:** Retailers generally tried to **delay** passing tariff costs to consumers, but some\u2014especially smaller retailers\u2014had already **raised prices because of tariffs**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### Ninth District (Minneapolis / Upper Midwest)\n- **Cause:** Tariff-related and broader input-cost pressures led some manufacturers to plan or implement price increases. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Effect:** Some firms reported already increasing prices or planning increases; survey data indicated **about one-fifth of District firms raised prices in September vs. the prior month** (the Beige Book links this to input-cost pressures; it does not isolate tariffs as the sole cause). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### Tenth District (Kansas City / Plains)\n- **Cause:** Input prices rose strongly among manufacturing firms (consistent with tariff pressure on inputs). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Effect:** Manufacturing firms expected **selling-price growth to accelerate**, including expectations of raising prices faster in **2026** than 2025\u2014evidence of anticipated pass-through, though the report does not quantify tariff-only effects. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### Eleventh District (Dallas / Southwest)\n- **Cause:** Tariffs had a \u201cwidespread impact\u201d on manufacturing costs; one computer manufacturer described customs applying steel/aluminum tariffs to products not containing those metals, increasing costs and causing delays. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Effect:** Selling prices rose slightly overall but **more sharply in manufacturing due to tariffs**, implying stronger pass-through in that sector. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### Twelfth District (San Francisco / West)\n- **Cause:** \u201cHigher import duties led to a widespread cost increase for imported supplies\u201d (raw materials, electrical/electronic components, food). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Effect:** Suppliers absorbed some increases, but **retailers passed a sizable portion to consumers**, especially in mid-to-high-end markets; retailers also attributed **slightly lower retail demand** partly to \u201chigher tariff-induced prices.\u201d [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Sector nuance:** Restaurants faced resistance to menu hikes; instead, some changed portion sizes/recipes\u2014**which reduced direct menu-price inflation despite higher tariff-linked input costs**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## What can/can\u2019t be claimed as \u201ccaused by tariffs\u201d\n- **Well-supported causal link:** Tariffs **increased input costs** in many Districts and **often led to higher selling prices** via surcharges or explicit price hikes (clear examples in Cleveland, New York, Dallas, and San Francisco). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Not purely causal / mixed drivers:** Where the report cites falling steel or lumber prices due to weak demand, that is an **offsetting demand effect**, not tariffs lowering prices. Likewise, some observed price changes (e.g., Minneapolis survey price increases) coincide with tariff pressures but are not attributed exclusively to tariffs. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\nOverall, tariffs **pushed up cost structures nearly everywhere**, but **district-by-district price outcomes diverged** based on demand strength, inventory timing, sector (manufacturing/retail vs. restaurants/services), and competitive strategies like absorption and discounting.

[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## Residential real estate (housing)\n- **Demand/sales:** Many Districts reported **flat to declining** residential activity. Boston noted **single-family closed sales were flat or slightly down** (as of August, y/y), Richmond described activity as **\u201crelatively flat,\u201d** and San Francisco said activity **decreased somewhat** with falling demand for new and existing single-family homes.

Boston reported a post\u2013Labor Day uptick and some large office transactions (with **office rents flat**), Chicago said office leasing **picked up** (rents/prices largely unchanged), and Dallas saw leasing improve with more signs of stability, though firms often chose **short-term leases** due to uncertainty. New York noted NYC office demand held up better than many large cities, partly due to **a few large transactions**, and reported **AI firms increasingly seeking office space**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Pricing/quality split:** Even where leasing improved, **pricing remained pressured** in some markets: Minneapolis reported **steep price discounts** for office building sales. Richmond emphasized **\u201cflight to quality,\u201d** warning **Class B and lower-tier** offices faced heightened distress/receivership risk and would not sell at \u201cyesterday\u2019s prices.\u201d Atlanta reported office vacancy increased somewhat because **new supply outpaced demand**, despite increased in-office requirements. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### Retail\n- Retail was **mixed but often relatively strong**. Boston reported **stable retail leasing**, **modest rent growth**, and **low vacancies**; Atlanta saw **declining retail vacancy rates** and strong demand; Richmond said retail space performed well; and St. Louis reported retail remained strong. New York described retail demand as **bifurcated**, with **luxury Manhattan retail** particularly resilient while other areas were weaker. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### Industrial\n- Industrial conditions were **mostly stable/solid with some softening signs**. Boston reported industrial leasing and sales were **stable**; Dallas said industrial activity **remained solid** though tenants were cautious and sometimes preferred short-term arrangements; New York characterized industrial activity as **muted** amid uncertainty about **interest rates and tariffs**. Minneapolis noted increased industrial subleasing but **overall vacancies remained low**; Chicago said industrial vacancy was low but available space was **sitting longer** and more warehouse inventory was available. San Francisco reported overall CRE activity was unchanged, with one contact seeing a **small increase in leasing demand** from manufacturing/logistics and mixed rent changes (with elevated vacancies in parts of Southern California pushing rents down). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### Construction backdrop\n- **New construction was subdued/declining in many areas**, supporting some stability for existing buildings but limiting growth. Some **data-center/infrastructure-related** projects were exceptions. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]",

      "reasoning": "The expected answer is that conditions in residential and commercial real estate (along with other interest rate-sensitive sectors) were *mixed*, with some reports noting improved business lending due to lower interest rates while others highlighted muted activity. The agent instead gives a long, highly specific description of generally soft residential real estate and broadly stable to modestly improving commercial real estate, with no mention of the key Beige Book characterization that conditions were mixed across interest rate-sensitive sectors and that lending had improved in some reports but remained muted in others. This does not align with the expected high-level summary and omits the central point about mixed conditions and lending effects of lower interest rates, so it is incorrect relative to the expected answer.",

      "answer": "Lower interest rates generally **supported business activity by lowering financing costs and improving sentiment**, which **caused** more borrowing and, in some cases, more investment\u2014though **uncertainty sometimes blunted** the response.\n\n## Main cause-effect channels\n- **Lower interest rates reduced borrowing costs \u2192 borrowers were more willing to take loans \u2192 business activity was supported via higher financing and spending.**\n  - In the **Cleveland District**, bankers reported loan demand **increased moderately** because households and businesses were **\u201cencouraged by lower interest rates,\u201d** and they expected further increases tied to anticipated rate cuts. **As a result**, credit demand rose, supporting activity. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - In the **San Francisco District**, financial institutions said **recent reductions in interest rates started to spur additional demand for loans**. **However**, borrowers remained cautious amid high uncertainty, indicating the lower-rate boost did not translate into an equally strong pickup in activity everywhere. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - The **National Summary** also noted that **some Districts saw improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates**, consistent with lower rates causing easier/stronger lending conditions that can support business activity.

[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Lower policy rates improved expectations/sentiment in rate-sensitive sectors \u2192 greater willingness to transact/invest \u2192 modest activity support.**\n  - In **Boston commercial real estate**, contacts said a **recent reduction in the federal funds rate lifted sentiment somewhat**. **As a result**, conditions for transactions/investment looked a bit more favorable, even though other fundamentals (like rent expectations) still weighed on outlook. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## Sector examples (what changed in practice)\n- **Financial services:** Lower rates **caused** an **uptick in loan demand** (Cleveland; also echoed in San Francisco). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Commercial construction/real estate:** Declining rates were associated with **modestly higher demand** and **more capital spending**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Equipment-related manufacturing/financing behavior:** A **Richmond District office equipment manufacturer** observed customers increasingly chose to **refinance equipment rather than buy new**, suggesting lower rates can **shift business behavior toward refinancing**, which may support balance sheets but does not necessarily raise new-sales activity one-for-one. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## Causation vs. correlation (what the text supports)\n- The Beige Book provides **direct qualitative attribution** in multiple places (e.g., borrowers were \u201cencouraged by lower interest rates\u201d; improved lending \u201cdue to lower interest rates\u201d), supporting a **causal interpretation** that lower rates contributed to higher loan demand and improved lending. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- It also signals **limits to causation strength**: elevated uncertainty kept some borrowers cautious, implying lower rates were a supportive factor but **not sufficient by themselves** to generate strong activity everywhere.

      "verdict": "partially_correct",

Because other factors (weaker demand and uncertainty) were also cited, this evidence is **partly correlational** rather than purely causal. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **AI speeds up routine work \u2192 reduced need for junior/entry-level roles \u2192 fewer entry-level hires.** In Minneapolis, contacts anticipated a \u201c**slight dampening effect on future labor demand**,\u201d and a Minnesota advertising firm said there \u201c**will be a smaller need for entry-level folks**\u201d because AI tools \u201c**get this work done faster**.\u201d **This was caused by** AI increasing productivity on routine tasks; **which in turn led to** expectations of fewer entry-level openings and less recruitment for junior roles. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Adopting AI capabilities that replace work \u2192 reduced overall labor needs \u2192 larger layoffs in some sectors.** In the Kansas City District, some professional service companies linked **larger recent layoffs** with adopting and implementing **AI capabilities that reduced overall labor needs**. **As a result**, employment decisions tilted toward cutting staff rather than reallocating or backfilling positions. This is closer to an explicit causal link (AI capabilities \u2192 reduced labor needs \u2192 layoffs), as described by the firms. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **AI targeted at less-experienced tasks \u2192 staffing reductions/early retirements/attrition \u2192 fewer roles reserved for junior workers.** In San Francisco, some manufacturing and health care contacts reported staffing reductions (attrition, layoffs, early retirements) that were **coupled with investment in AI**, particularly for \u201c**positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees**.\u201d **This suggests** AI-enabled substitution or redesign of these tasks **led to** cuts or non-replacement in those categories. Since the report says \u201cin some cases\u201d and \u201ccoupled with,\u201d the relationship is suggestive but not uniformly causal across all firms. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Early generative AI results + weak demand risk \u2192 expectations of further cuts.** In Atlanta, some firms expected additional headcount reductions based on early generative AI implementation results, especially if demand slows. **As a result**, AI adoption contributed not only to current staffing decisions but also to forward-looking plans to reduce employment. (The precise degree of causation vs. joint influence with demand conditions is not fully isolated in the evidence.) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**What the evidence does *not* show clearly:** These sources do not directly describe AI changing *how* employers recruit or screen candidates (e.g., automated resume screening). The documented effect on \u201cemployment decisions\u201d is primarily **indirect**, operating through reduced labor demand and reallocation away from entry-level tasks, which then led to fewer hires and, in some cases, layoffs or attrition-based reductions.

Tourism contacts also described a widening gap where **only luxury leisure travel was growing** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Middle-income:** Showed **pullback signs in travel**, including reported **dips in travel demand especially among middle-class consumers** (e.g., select-service hotels), described as a \u201c**middle-class recession**\u201d in that segment [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Lower-income / low-to-moderate income:** More likely to **reduce discretionary spending** and focus on essentials, with some travelers choosing **closer-to-home destinations to save** (value-seeking behavior often associated with tighter budgets) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n### Regarding retail mix and \u201chigher-end\u201d categories\n- **Upper-income / mid-to-upper-income:** Supported retail resilience in some areas; for example, **apparel** sold well and **cosmetics/fragrances** were strong where **mid- to upper-income consumers** were more resilient [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. **Luxury goods** generally continued to perform well [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Middle-income:** Became **more cautious**, attempting to maintain spending but with mounting strain (see financing/credit below) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Lower-income / low-to-moderate income:** More constrained demand for non-essentials; evidence also suggested **demand for more affordable goods declined further** in some retail reporting, consistent with affordability pressure [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n### Regarding price sensitivity, discounts, and \u201ctrading down\u201d\n- **Upper-income / mid-to-upper-income:** Less evidence of discount-driven behavior; spending stayed **more resilient** in higher-end categories and experiences [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Middle-income:** Increasingly **value-conscious**, with growing signs of financial strain that can drive trading-down behaviors (e.g., reliance on credit/BNPL; see below) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Lower-income / low-to-moderate income:** Highly **price sensitive**\u2014**sales, deals, and markdowns** drove purchasing surges, especially because lower-income households \u201c**need to be more selective**\u201d [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. More broadly, **lower- and middle-income households** continued to **seek discounts and promotions** amid rising prices and uncertainty [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n### Regarding financing spending (credit, BNPL, delinquencies, savings drawdowns)\n- **Upper-income / mid-to-upper-income:** More able to **absorb higher costs** and continue discretionary spending without the same reported reliance on consumer credit to maintain baseline consumption [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Middle-income:** Contacts reported middle-income households were **using credit to maintain spending levels** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. Related stress signals included increasing reliance on **\u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d** and **elevated credit card delinquency rates** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Lower-income / low-to-moderate income:** More acute hardship indicators\u2014community contacts reported consumers **using savings to cover basic needs**, **reducing spending where possible**, and having greater difficulty paying essentials (rent/utilities), alongside higher **food pantry usage** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n### Regarding big-ticket/durable purchases (notably autos)\n- **Upper-income / mid-to-upper-income:** The evidence emphasizes resilience in higher-end consumption rather than strong growth in durables; no specific upper-income auto trend was highlighted [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Middle-income:** Some \u201ctrade-down\u201d signals appeared in broader auto demand shifts (toward cheaper options), consistent with affordability constraints [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Lower-income / low-to-moderate income:** In some lower-income areas, **used-vehicle demand was softer**, consistent with tight budgets and affordability constraints [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n## What drove the differences?\n\n### Regarding exposure to rising prices and price sensitivity\n- **Lower-/middle-income:** Spending was more constrained by **rising prices** and **heightened price sensitivity**, leading to heavier reliance on discounts/promotions and more selective purchasing [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Upper-income:** Greater ability to tolerate price increases helped sustain discretionary and higher-end spending (a \u201cbifurcated\u201d pattern) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n### Regarding purchasing power and the need to borrow\n- **Middle-income:** **Inflation eroded purchasing power**, and contacts explicitly reported the middle-income group **using credit to maintain spending**, alongside BNPL use and delinquencies\u2014signs that maintaining prior consumption increasingly required financing [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Upper-income:** More financial resilience reduced the need for such coping mechanisms while allowing continued discretionary outlays [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n### Regarding basic-needs stress vs discretionary flexibility\n- **Lower-income:** Greater **economic precarity** (difficulty paying rent/utilities and increased food pantry use) forced cutbacks and diversion of limited resources toward essentials; contacts also flagged vulnerability to planned cuts to **SNAP and Medicaid** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Upper-income:** A higher share of spending could remain discretionary (travel/luxury/services), so spending held up better even as conditions softened elsewhere [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n### Regarding market-specific price pass-through (including tariff-related pressures)\n- **Mid-/high-end markets vs affordability segments:** Some reports described **tariff-driven cost increases** with retailers passing through sizable portions (noted mostly in **mid- to high-end markets**), while restaurants saw resistance to menu-price increases; at the same time, **luxury goods performed well** while **more affordable goods weakened**, consistent with higher-income resilience vs lower-income constraint [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n**Net result:** The Beige Book evidence points to a **two-speed consumer**: higher-income households maintained discretionary/luxury spending, while middle- and lower-income households became more price sensitive, more reliant on credit/savings, and more focused on essentials\u2014driven by inflation/price increases, affordability constraints, and differing financial buffers [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].",

      "question": "What is the relationship between AI investment and employment trends reported in the Beige Book?",
      "expected": "Some employers cited increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies as one of the reasons for lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. This occurred alongside other factors like weaker demand and elevated economic uncertainty. Overall employment levels were largely stable, but demand for labor was generally muted, with more employers reporting layoffs and attrition.",
      "answer": "In the Oct. 15, 2025 Beige Book, the reported relationship between AI investment and employment trends is mostly framed as **AI spending contributing to labor-saving efficiency gains that reduce or dampen headcount growth**, particularly for **entry-level/routine work**\u2014while also generating **some offsetting IT/services demand** tied to implementation.\n\n## Core cause \u2192 effect links reported\n\n### 1) AI investment as a labor-substitution/efficiency strategy \u2192 headcount reductions and muted labor demand\n- **Businesses invested in AI to get work done with fewer people**, and Beige Book contacts explicitly connected this to **layoffs, attrition-based reductions, and lower overall labor needs**. This was described as occurring \u201cin some cases\u201d alongside other drivers like weaker demand and uncertainty. **As a result**, employment was \u201clargely stable\u201d overall, but **labor demand was muted** and **more employers reported lowering head counts**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Kansas City (Tenth District):** Larger layoffs at some professional services firms were **associated with adopting and implementing AI capabilities that reduced overall labor needs**. This is one of the clearest statements in the report linking AI implementation to a direct reduction in labor requirements. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **San Francisco (Twelfth District):** Some employers combined **staff reductions (attrition/layoffs/early retirements)** with **investment in AI**, particularly for tasks \u201cusually reserved for less experienced employees.\u201d **Which in turn led to** less need for certain roles even as firms maintained \u201creplacement\u201d hiring rather than expansion hiring. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Atlanta (Sixth District):** Some firms expected **further cuts** based on early **Generative AI implementation results**, implying that early productivity/ROI signals from GenAI pilots are **causing staffing plans to be revised downward**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Minneapolis (Ninth District):** Contacts expected AI to have a **slight dampening effect on future labor demand**; one advertising firm anticipated a **smaller need for entry-level workers** because AI tools complete work faster. **As a result**, the employment impact is described as concentrating on entry-level hiring needs. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### 2) AI investment + broader uncertainty/weaker demand \u2192 shift from expansion hiring to replacement/contingent hiring\n- The Beige Book also indicates that when firms did hire, it was often **to backfill** rather than expand. This pattern is not attributed solely to AI\u2014contacts also cited **weaker demand and elevated uncertainty**\u2014but AI investment is repeatedly mentioned as **one contributing factor** to reduced net hiring. **Consequently**, hiring shifted toward **replacement**, and in some districts toward **temporary/part-time/project-based roles** rather than permanent additions. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### 3) AI adoption \u2192 role-mix changes (especially fewer entry-level tasks) \u2192 reduced entry-level opportunities\n- Where the Beige Book is most specific is on **who** may be affected: AI tools were described as taking over tasks often assigned to **less experienced/entry-level workers**. **This was caused by** AI being able to produce routine outputs faster (e.g., advertising/creative production tasks), **leading to** expectations of reduced entry-level hiring needs. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## Important nuance: AI-related spending can also increase demand for some services\n- **Boston (First District):** Software and IT services firms cited strong demand partly due to **spillover IT investments related to AI adoption**. **This suggests** AI investment can **raise demand for complementary IT services** (implementation, integration, infrastructure), even while other contacts report headcount reductions in the adopting firms. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## Causation vs. correlation (what the Beige Book supports)\n- The Beige Book provides **contact-level causal language** in certain districts (e.g., layoffs \u201cassociated with\u201d AI implementation reducing labor needs; firms expecting cuts based on GenAI results), which supports a **plausible causal pathway** from AI adoption to lower labor demand in those cases. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- However, at the national level the report is careful\u2014headcount reductions were linked to **weaker demand and uncertainty**, and **\u201cin some cases\u201d** to increased AI investment\u2014so the broader relationship is best characterized as **AI being one contributor among several** rather than the sole cause of muted employment growth. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Bottom line:** The Beige Book depicts AI investment mainly as a **productivity/labor-saving input** that **reduces or dampens labor needs (especially entry-level)** and contributes to **headcount reductions or slower net hiring**, while also creating **some offsetting demand** for AI-related IT/services spending in parts of the economy.

In the Cleveland District, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to uncertainty around federal grants. In the Boston District, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health-care sectors.",
      "answer": "Federal policy changes affected nonprofits across districts mainly through two causal channels\u2014(1) changes in federal benefits that altered client need and nonprofits\u2019 payer mix, and (2) changes/uncertainty in federal grants that directly constrained nonprofit budgets and staffing. In some places, immigration and trade policy shifts also affected local economic conditions and nonprofit operating environments.\n\n## 1) Federal benefit program reductions/cuts \u2192 greater client hardship and service demand \u2192 financial strain on service providers\n- **In the New York District,** nonprofits reported challenges caused by **\u201cunpredictable funding\u201d and \u201ca reduction in federal benefit programs.\u201d** This was linked to worsening client finances: a community health-care center observed **rising financial distress among Medicaid patients**, which in turn **limited patient access** and **strained the nonprofit\u2019s finances**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **In the Boston (First) District,** contacts flagged **planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid** as a forward-looking risk. This was expected to **increase hardship among low- and moderate-income households**, which in turn would **raise downstream demand for nonprofit and community support services** (the Beige Book frames this as risk; the demand increase is a typical downstream effect rather than a quantified outcome in the passage). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## 2) Federal grant cuts/uncertainty \u2192 budget tightening \u2192 layoffs, hiring freezes, reduced ability to deliver services\n- **In the Boston (First) District,** **cuts to federal grant funding** were reported to have **contributed to layoffs in education and health-care.** Because many nonprofits operate in or alongside these sectors, the mechanism is direct for grant-dependent organizations: reduced federal grant inflows caused labor reductions. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **In the Cleveland (Fourth) District,** nonprofits reported **more frequent funding decreases** over six months; one organization **used reserve funds for operating expenses for the first time in 10+ years.** A respondent explicitly tied staffing decisions to federal policy conditions: organizations were **not filling open positions due to \u201cuncertainty around federal grants.\u201d** This indicates a causal pathway from grant uncertainty \u2192 risk management \u2192 hiring freezes/reserve drawdowns. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **In the San Francisco (Twelfth) District,** community support organizations experienced **rising demand for food, basic necessities, and health care**, but **\u201cfunding and grant cuts\u201d limited their ability to provide assistance.** Here the effect is explicit: grant/funding cuts constrained service capacity despite higher need. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **In the St. Louis (Eighth) District,** a Mississippi hospital CEO participating in a **federal viability-related program** was concerned that **new grant funding \u201cmay not arrive in time to stabilize operations.\u201d** This shows a timing/administration channel: even when a federal program exists, delayed or uncertain grant disbursement can prolong distress and threaten continuity. The District also noted **growing demand for nonprofit services**, which can compound financial stress when funding is delayed. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## 3) Immigration policy changes (and related enforcement effects) \u2192 shifts in local demand and labor supply \u2192 indirect pressures on nonprofits\n- The Beige Book also notes **recent changes in immigration policies** affecting conditions in some communities. In the **San Francisco District**, contacts attributed some **declines in small-business demand** to **changes in customer behavior in response to immigration policy**. This is an indirect channel: immigration policy changes can alter local economic activity and community needs, which can in turn affect nonprofits\u2019 client populations and fundraising environment, though the nonprofit-specific causal effect is not fully quantified in the cited text. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## 4) Trade policy/tariffs \u2192 higher costs and prices \u2192 tighter nonprofit budgets and higher client need (contextual)\n- Contacts cited **tariffs/trade policy changes** as contributing to **higher consumer prices and operating costs**, which can squeeze nonprofit budgets and increase client hardship. This mechanism is described at a general level in the report rather than tied to a specific district\u2019s nonprofit outcomes. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## What is clearly causal vs. more contextual\n- **Most clearly causal in the text:** federal benefit reductions/cuts and federal grant cuts/uncertainty are explicitly linked to concrete nonprofit outcomes\u2014financial distress among clients and providers, layoffs, hiring freezes, reserve fund use, and constrained service delivery. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **More contextual/indirect in the text:** immigration policy and tariffs are described as affecting broader local conditions (demand, costs, labor supply), which plausibly pressure nonprofits, but the Beige Book excerpts provided do not always tie these factors to specific nonprofit balance-sheet or staffing outcomes in the same direct way.

      "question": "How did firms in different sectors respond to tariff-induced cost increases in terms of their pricing strategies?",
      "expected": "Responses to tariff-induced costs varied by sector: In manufacturing and retail trades, some firms fully passed higher import costs along to customers. Other firms facing tariff-induced cost pressures kept selling prices largely unchanged to preserve market share and due to pushback from price-sensitive clients. In Chicago, a retail industry analyst expected peak tariff impact in the first half of 2026.",
      "answer": "1) Absorb tariff costs / hold prices steady (no or minimal pass-through)\n- Manufacturing: Some manufacturers held prices steady despite higher costs to gain/maintain market share [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. Auto manufacturers were cited as absorbing tariff increases to avoid further demand declines [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- Consumer/services: Restaurants (e.g., Boston) saw profitability fall as menu prices were mostly unchanged amid rising costs [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n2) Pass tariff costs through to customers via price increases (partial to full)\n- Manufacturing: Firms reported raising selling prices (or planning increases) in response to tariffs (e.g., Minneapolis) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. A New York specialty appliance manufacturer raised prices for the second time in 2025 due to tariffs [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. Boston noted smaller manufacturers passed through a larger share of tariff-related costs [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- Retail/consumer: Some retailers passed a sizable portion of higher import-duty-related costs to consumers (San Francisco), particularly in mid- to high-end markets [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. Nationally, some firms in manufacturing and retail were reported to fully pass higher import costs to customers (though the extent varied) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- Example magnitude: A St. Louis apparel firm expected overall price increases of about 3%, with some items (e.g., uniforms) up about 5% tied to input cost increases [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n3) Add explicit tariff-related surcharges (separating tariff costs from base price)\n- Manufacturing/wholesale: Several manufacturers and wholesalers (Cleveland) introduced tariff-related surcharges to cover added costs [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n4) Use selective, item-by-item (elasticity-based) pricing rather than broad increases\n- Retail: A major retailer (New York) adjusted price increases based on demand elasticity for each item [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. Cleveland retail contacts, constrained in pricing power, raised prices only on select items [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n5) Increase discounting/markdowns or incentives to protect demand (despite cost pressure)\n- Consumer-facing sectors: Philadelphia reported consumer-facing firms often couldn\u2019t pass through all cost increases and instead used more discounting to sustain demand (including more aggressive retail discounts, lower hotel rates, and more auto incentives) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n6) Delay pass-through (timing strategies tied to inventory or \u201cholding off\u201d)\n- Retail: Chicago retailers tried to hold off passing tariff-related cost increases to consumers for as long as possible [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- Cross-sector/manufacturing: Richmond contacts indicated some tariff-related input costs had not yet been passed along; some expected to raise prices after working through pre-tariff inventory [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. Philadelphia similarly noted dwindling inventories of pre-tariff goods reduced firms\u2019 ability to keep absorbing costs [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n7) Use non-price adjustments or product changes to manage \u201ceffective pricing\u201d\n- Restaurants/food service: Some San Francisco restaurants resisted menu price increases by reducing portion sizes or changing recipes instead of raising listed prices [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- Manufacturing: A Richmond-area fuse box manufacturer reconfigured products to cut costs and lower prices in response to customer price sensitivity [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n8) Mitigate costs upstream to reduce/avoid immediate price changes (complementary to pricing)\n- Cross-sector: Firms reported negotiating with suppliers and finding alternative inputs to offset tariff impacts, which could lessen the need for immediate pass-through [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\nNote: This list reflects strategies explicitly reported in the cited Beige Book summary and District anecdotes; it may be incomplete for all sectors/firms not covered in those reports, and the Beige Book notes pass-through varied widely by firm and market [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].",

[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Suggestive correlation (not definitive causation):** After the incentive-driven period, some places still reported broader softness or shifting preferences\u2014e.g., **Kansas City** noted demand shifting away from SUVs and EVs toward sedans/used vehicles, and **Cleveland** reported sales generally flat to down. These observations are consistent with the idea that the EV surge was **temporary and not sufficient to offset underlying affordability/weak-demand conditions everywhere**, but the Beige Book does not prove a direct post-expiration drop caused solely by the policy change.

      "question": "What were the multiple factors affecting labor costs, and how did they interact with wage growth?",
      "expected": "Wages grew at a modest to moderate pace across all districts. However, labor cost pressures intensified due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses. Additionally, some contacts in the Chicago District reported moderate increases in nonlabor costs including energy and higher prices for raw materials. This meant total compensation costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.",
      "answer": "Multiple forces were pushing **total labor costs** up or down in the October 15, 2025 Beige Book, and they interacted with **wage growth** mainly through (1) labor supply/demand conditions, (2) nonwage benefit inflation, and (3) firms\u2019 ability/willingness to pass costs through given profitability.\n\n## 1) Wage growth itself directly raised labor costs, but the pace varied by conditions\n- **Rising base wages \u2192 higher payroll costs.** Across Districts, wages were generally reported as rising **modestly to moderately**, which mechanically increases total labor expenditures. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Labor market cooling \u2192 subdued wage growth (correlation with weaker demand/greater availability).** Where labor demand was softer and worker availability improved, wage growth tended to be muted\u2014for example, Kansas City reported \u201cwaning growth in labor demand\u201d and the availability of \u201cformer federal workers,\u201d which \u201ckept wage growth subdued.\u201d [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Forward-looking moderation.** Dallas firms expected wage growth to slow to **3.4% over the next 12 months** vs **3.8% over the past 12 months**, consistent with subdued demand and more cautious hiring. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## 2) Benefits inflation (especially health insurance) lifted labor costs even when wage growth was only modest\n- **Outsized health insurance increases \u2192 intensified labor-cost pressure.** The national summary explicitly ties intensifying labor cost pressures to \u201coutsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses.\u201d This means **total compensation costs** could accelerate even if **wages** were not accelerating at the same rate. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Wages + benefits moved together in some cases \u2192 compounded labor-cost increases.** Chicago cited increases in \u201chealth insurance premiums\u201d alongside modest wage/benefit increases. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15] St. Louis reported a **4% cost-of-living adjustment** occurring \u201calongside a significant increase in employer contributions to the health insurance program,\u201d illustrating how benefit inflation can stack on top of wage adjustments. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## 3) Labor supply disruptions (notably immigration-policy effects) raised labor costs and created sector-specific wage pressure\n- **Reduced labor availability \u2192 scarcity \u2192 higher labor costs (and upward wage pressure where acute).** Multiple Districts described labor supply as strained \u201cdue to recent changes to immigration policies.\u201d [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Immigration-enforcement fears \u2192 workers not showing up \u2192 tighter labor pools \u2192 cost increases.** St. Louis noted shortages when workers did not report to work because of \u201cfears of deportation,\u201d and a Memphis construction firm said a \u201creduced labor pool was driving up labor costs.\u201d [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Disruptions requiring rehiring \u2192 added labor costs.** Chicago reported reduced labor availability tied to \u201cfear of immigration enforcement\u201d and visa revocations that required rehiring, which can raise costs via recruitment, onboarding, and potentially higher offered pay. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n*Interpretation note:* The Beige Book evidence supports a **cause-effect channel** from policy/enforcement-related labor supply reductions to higher labor costs in affected sectors, but it is more suggestive than fully quantified.\n\n## 4) Workforce adjustments (headcount, hours, mix) changed total labor spend and fed back into wage growth\n- **Layoffs/attrition/right-sizing \u2192 lower total labor spend and reduced wage pressure.** More employers reported lowering head counts via layoffs and attrition; this reduces aggregate labor demand, which **tends to** damp wage growth. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Shifting to temporary/part-time labor \u2192 lower benefit exposure \u2192 contained labor costs.** Some employers favored temporary and part-time workers over full-time roles, which can reduce benefit obligations and change effective labor costs even if hourly wage rates don\u2019t fall. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## 5) Skill and occupation mix created \u201cpockets\u201d of faster wage growth even when overall wage growth was moderate\n- **Specialized-skill scarcity \u2192 targeted wage premiums.** Wage pressures persisted for \u201chighly specialized positions, such as in AI technology,\u201d indicating that even in a moderating overall market, niche scarcity can push wages (and thus labor costs) up for particular roles. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Competitive hiring in some areas \u2192 wage increases.** Cleveland reported some firms raised wages due to \u201cpersistent competition in the labor market.\u201d [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## 6) Collective bargaining produced discrete wage increases independent of broader market easing\n- **Union contract negotiations \u2192 step-up in wage scales \u2192 higher labor costs.** San Francisco reported wages rose in health care \u201cas a result of recent labor union contract negotiations,\u201d a direct mechanism raising wage growth in that segment even if broader wage trends were modest. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## 7) Technology substitution (AI) both reduced labor needs and altered wage dynamics\n- **AI investment \u2192 reduced labor needs \u2192 layoffs/right-sizing \u2192 muted wage growth pressure.** Kansas City professional services linked larger layoffs to AI adoption that \u201creduced overall labor needs,\u201d and the national summary similarly associates headcount reductions with increased AI investment. This reduces labor demand, which **in turn tends to** restrain wage growth. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## 8) Profitability and pricing constraints limited wage growth even as other labor costs rose\n- **Margin pressure/lack of profitability \u2192 firms hold wages flat or minimize increases.** Cleveland noted manufacturers that \u201cheld wages steady because of lack of profitability,\u201d and a restaurateur aimed to hire \u201cas close to minimum wage as possible.\u201d This shows a channel where firms\u2019 inability to absorb or pass through costs **caused** wage restraint, even while benefits (like health insurance) might be rising. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## How these factors interacted overall\n- **Total labor costs rose from two sides:** (1) **modest-to-moderate wage increases** and (2) **outsized benefit (health insurance) increases**, with benefits sometimes being the bigger incremental driver. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Wage growth was simultaneously pushed up and pulled down:**\n  - Pushed up where **labor supply was constrained** (e.g., immigration-related shortages) or **skills were scarce** (AI/specialized roles) or **contracts reset pay** (union negotiations). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - Pulled down where **labor demand softened**, **headcounts were reduced**, **AI substituted for labor**, or **profitability constraints** forced wage freezes/minimal offers. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\nNet effect: the Beige Book depicts an environment where **wage growth generally stayed moderate**, but **overall labor-cost pressure could still intensify** because nonwage components\u2014especially employer health insurance\u2014rose sharply, while labor supply shocks and skill scarcity created uneven wage outcomes across sectors and occupations.

      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer focuses narrowly on three key points: (1) wages were rising at a modest to moderate pace, (2) labor cost pressures were intensified mainly by outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance, and (3) some Chicago contacts also saw moderate increases in nonlabor costs (energy and raw materials), so total compensation costs were rising faster than wage growth alone implied.\n\nThe agent\u2019s answer does include the central idea that modest-to-moderate wage growth plus outsized health insurance cost increases caused total labor costs to rise faster than wage growth, and it explicitly states that health insurance was an important driver of intensified labor cost pressures. However, it introduces many additional mechanisms (immigration policy, AI, layoffs, union contracts, etc.) that are not in the expected answer and fails to mention the specific point about nonlabor cost increases in the Chicago District (energy and raw materials) as part of the explanation.\n\nBecause it gets the core wage-growth-plus-health-insurance interaction right but misses the Chicago nonlabor-cost factor that the expected answer explicitly calls out, the response is best categorized as partially_correct rather than fully correct.",

The housing market's response to lower rates was more muted than commercial sectors.",
      "answer": "Lower interest rates (and expectations of further cuts) affected interest rate\u2011sensitive sectors mainly by reducing financing costs and improving borrowing/refinancing incentives, but the Beige Book evidence shows the transmission was uneven across Districts and often blunted by uncertainty and sector-specific headwinds. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## 1) Banking/credit (loan demand and refinancing)\n- **Cleveland (Fourth District):** Lower interest rates **encouraged households and businesses to borrow**, which **caused** a moderate increase in loan demand; commercial construction and financial services contacts also reported an **uptick in demand because of lower rates**. **As a result**, contacts expected demand to rise further if cuts continued. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **San Francisco (Twelfth District):** \u201cRecent reductions in interest rates\u201d **started to spur additional demand for loans**, but this effect was **partly offset** because borrowers remained cautious amid uncertainty\u2014so the observed relationship is \u201crates down \u2192 some demand up,\u201d but the Beige Book also indicates uncertainty constrained follow-through.

(This is an expectation, not a confirmed realized shift.) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Cleveland (Fourth District):** The report highlights a related rate mechanism on the supply side: homeowners were reluctant to sell and give up previously locked-in low mortgage rates.

[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Richmond (Fifth District):** An equipment-related example underscores substitution behavior: an uptick in customers **refinancing equipment rather than buying new** suggests lower rates (or improved refinancing terms) **shifted** demand toward refinancing instead of new purchases; CRE had a slight uptick but remained \u201cmurky,\u201d particularly with office stress.

[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Chicago (Seventh District):** Even as loan rates moved down, tighter terms and slight decreases in business loan demand coincided with auto-supplier weaknesses affecting loan quality\u2014suggesting the auto/manufacturing channel remained constrained and credit-risk concerns persisted. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## Bottom line\nLower interest rates most clearly **caused** (or were explicitly linked to) **increased loan/refinancing interest** in several Districts (notably Cleveland and San Francisco, and parts of St. Louis and Chicago). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15] In housing and real estate, lower rates mainly **improved sentiment/expectations** and influenced tenure decisions (New York), but actual activity often remained weak or constrained by affordability, incentives, and the mortgage \u201clock-in\u201d effect (Cleveland, Dallas). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15] For commercial construction/CRE, declining rates supported some financing-sensitive demand, but ongoing uncertainty and sector stress (e.g., office) limited the response. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15] In capital-intensive manufacturing/auto, the Beige Book points more to **caution and uncertainty** than to a rate-driven rebound, implying that rate cuts were not sufficient to overcome other headwinds.

It also mentions Kansas City in the context of sector-specific uncertainty.\n\nHowever, it diverges in several important ways:\n- It does not clearly identify Chicago manufacturers\u2019 tariff-related planning difficulty as such (it only mentions Chicago nonprofits and Chicago agriculture, not Chicago manufacturing as in the expected answer).\n- It does not explicitly mention federal grant uncertainty for nonprofits across Cleveland, New York, and Boston; instead, it refers more generally to federal funding and SNAP/Medicaid uncertainty and does not tie this specifically to nonprofits in those districts.\n- It does not single out \u201cpolicy uncertainty\u201d in Dallas as a top business concern (it embeds Dallas in a broader list of factors like demand, inflation, and tariffs without highlighting policy uncertainty as the primary concern).\n- It assigns the immigration-policy-driven labor-supply effects mainly to Atlanta and a cross-district theme, not to St. Louis and Boston as specified in the expected answer.\n- For Kansas City, it emphasizes energy-sector uncertainty from commodity prices, and does not mention that, despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic.\n\nBecause several specific, expected district-factor linkages are missing or misaligned (e.g., St. Louis/Boston immigration, nonprofit grant uncertainty in Cleveland/New York, optimistic 2026 expectations in Kansas City), the answer captures only part of what was expected.

In Chicago, manufacturing demand declined modestly with fabricated metals demand unchanged on balance as higher sales to some sectors were offset by lower sales to construction and automotive industries. Tariff-induced input cost increases affected manufacturing across many districts, with firms reporting difficulty planning due to changing tariff policies. Labor shortages due to immigration policy changes also constrained production in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture sectors.",
      "answer": "Manufacturing was affected by several supply chain disruptions that either constrained access to inputs directly or raised input costs enough to reduce or halt output.\n\n- **Reduced availability of equipment/materials \u2192 shrinking inventories \u2192 tighter production conditions.** New York-area manufacturers reported \u201csome difficulty procuring equipment and materials,\u201d with **supply availability worsening** and **inventories continuing to shrink** (even though delivery times were \u201clittle changed\u201d). **This was caused by worsening supply availability**, and **as a result** firms had less inventory buffer, which **in turn led to** more constrained operating conditions for production (i.e., less ability to maintain output when inputs are hard to source). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Steel-related input disruption (price shock) \u2192 temporary production stoppage (direct causation).** An upstate New York keg manufacturer **temporarily ceased production due to high steel prices**. **This was caused by** a severe input-cost shock tied to steel, and **as a result** production was **directly interrupted** (a clear causal link, explicitly stated). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Higher costs / constraints for imported components (e.g., semiconductor chips) \u2192 scaled-back production (association reported).** In the San Francisco District, manufacturers generally reported materials were available but **at higher costs**, including **imported semiconductor chips** (and utilities). **Within that context**, one Hawaii-based manufacturer reported **lower production volumes** (and reduced payroll). **This suggests** elevated input costs were associated with reduced output; however, the source does not prove a single-input causal mechanism beyond the reported cost pressures occurring alongside lower volumes. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Tariff-related sourcing frictions/cost increases \u2192 higher effective input costs \u2192 pressure on production and sourcing decisions.** Cleveland District manufacturers reported **tariff-related cost increases** on raw materials, imported components, and chemical inputs. Separately, a computer manufacturer said **U.S. customs was applying steel and aluminum tariffs to products that do not contain these metals**, and that resolving challenges took time\u2014**creating administrative friction** in the supply chain. **This was caused by** tariff policy/administration, and **as a result** firms faced higher and more uncertain input costs (and delays from dispute resolution), which **can lead to** production cutbacks or interruptions when costs become prohibitive or inputs are delayed (though the excerpts mainly document cost/friction increases rather than specific output declines in these cases).

      "question": "What service-related costs contributed to input cost increases, and how did this affect different sectors?",
      "expected": "Several service-related costs drove input cost increases: insurance, health care, and technology solutions all saw higher costs. In New York, rising business costs including insurance added to financial pressures for community service providers. Employer-sponsored health insurance expenses saw outsized increases, intensifying labor cost pressures across districts. These service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.",
      "answer": "Service-related input-cost increases were driven mainly by higher **insurance**, **health-care benefits**, and **technology/IT services**, with **utilities** and some **local fees/policies** also adding pressure. These higher service expenses raised firms\u2019 overhead and operating costs, which in turn affected sectors differently depending on their ability to pass costs through to customers or absorb them in margins. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## 1) What service-related costs pushed input costs up (causes)\n- **Insurance (especially liability/business insurance):** Input costs rose as insurance premiums increased; this was explicitly highlighted in the National Summary and multiple Districts. In Philadelphia, a contact cited **a 15% year-over-year increase in a liability insurance policy**; Boston reported liability insurance rates rising sharply; St. Louis also flagged insurance premiums as part of input-price pressure. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Health care / employer health insurance:** Rising health-care costs increased labor-related overhead. Philadelphia cited **nearly a 10% rise in health-care costs**; Minneapolis noted significant increases in employee health care premiums for the coming year; the National Summary reported \u201coutsized increases\u201d in employer-sponsored health insurance as intensifying labor cost pressures. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Technology/IT services (\u201ctechnology solutions\u201d):** Higher costs for technology services contributed to faster input-cost growth nationally; Cleveland contacts cited elevated technology costs (including in banking and professional/business services); Boston noted IT service prices rose moderately. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Utilities:** Utilities were cited as an ongoing cost pressure (Philadelphia) and as rising for manufacturers beyond tariff effects (Cleveland). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Local fees/policies affecting service costs (example: NYC congestion pricing):** A NYC specialty contractor reported congestion pricing was pushing up the cost of doing business considerably, adding to cost pressures. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## 2) How these higher service-related input costs affected sectors (effects)\nAcross sectors, the mechanism was similar: **higher service/overhead costs increased total input costs**, which then **either led to price increases/surcharges** where demand allowed or **compressed margins and reduced activity/investment** where price pass-through was constrained. Many reports also mention tariffs as a separate (often concurrent) driver; where both were present, the Beige Book describes them as jointly contributing to input-cost pressure rather than isolating a single cause. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Services (incl. professional/business services):** Because many service firms rely heavily on insurance, health benefits, and technology, these increases **directly raised operating costs**, which in turn **squeezed margins when revenues did not keep pace** (e.g., Dallas noted health-care and business insurance premiums rising faster than revenues). In Richmond, some service firms reported cost increases (including from tariffs) that had **not yet been fully passed through**, implying near-term margin pressure. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Manufacturing:** Although materials and tariffs were often central, added overhead (including utilities and insurance in some reports) **reinforced cost escalation**, which in turn **led many manufacturers to raise selling prices or add surcharges**; others held prices to protect market share, implying **margin compression**. In more severe cases, high input costs contributed to production disruptions (e.g., a NY keg manufacturer temporarily ceased production amid high steel prices). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Retail trade:** Retailers faced broad cost pressures (often tariff-related, but also affected by general overhead such as insurance). As a result, pricing responses were mixed: some **passed costs through selectively** due to customer price sensitivity, while others **fully passed through** increases; one large retailer tailored increases to item-level demand elasticity. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Restaurants/hospitality:** When operating costs rise (including service/overhead and food inputs), restaurants often have limited pricing power. This **led to profitability declines** where menu prices could not rise much; reported adaptations included **reducing portion sizes or changing recipes**, and Boston noted profitability fell while menu prices were mostly unchanged amid resistance to price increases and, in some cases, softer traffic. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Agriculture:** Higher operating expenses (including packaging and financing costs noted in SF, and rising projected input costs like fertilizer in Chicago) **strained farm finances**, especially when commodity prices were low. This in turn **damped capital spending** (equipment purchases/repairs) and heightened distress, with St. Louis warning of potential bankruptcies/exits. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Oil & gas / energy extraction:** Higher input costs (notably metals, per Minneapolis) **raised the breakeven price for crude**, which in turn **weakened project economics** and could constrain activity. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Construction/real estate:** Effects were **uneven**: some Chicago contacts reported **no recent change in input prices**, while other reports (e.g., Boston) described continued upward pressure from tariffs and labor shortages. Where costs rose, this **reduced project feasibility** (e.g., workforce housing), but the Beige Book evidence indicates regional variation rather than a uniform national outcome. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Nonprofits/community service providers:** Rising operating costs\u2014explicitly including insurance\u2014**increased financial pressure**, which can translate into tighter budgets or reduced service capacity (the Beige Book describes the cost pressure but provides limited quantification of downstream service cuts). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n## Notes on causation vs. correlation\nThe Beige Book reports reflect qualitative contacts\u2019 accounts. Where contacts explicitly stated that rising insurance/health-care/technology costs were contributing to higher input costs, the relationship is presented as causal in the narrative. In other cases (e.g., sector outcomes like reduced investment), the report often describes co-occurrence with other drivers (especially tariffs and labor shortages), so the evidence supports a **combined contribution** rather than isolating service costs as the sole cause.

      "question": "How did banking conditions differ for consumer versus business lending across districts?",
      "expected": "In Kansas City, while expectations for 2026 were optimistic, consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately, signaling stress among households. In Chicago, business loan demand decreased slightly on net with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity, while consumer loan demand increased slightly with a pickup in mortgage refinancing. In Dallas, loan demand grew overall. St. Louis reported banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions. Consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.",
      "answer": "### Overall loan demand\n- **Consumer lending:** Demand was generally **steady to muted**, with pockets of strength. In **New York**, consumer-loan demand **held steady** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. In **Atlanta**, consumer demand was **muted** and consumer lending **contracted further** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. In **Chicago**, consumer demand **increased slightly** (including some pickup in refinancing) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. In **Philadelphia**, consumer lending **rose strongly** (excluding auto and credit cards) despite overall lending declines [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Business (C&I) lending:** Demand was more often described as **soft/declining**, though not uniformly. In **Philadelphia**, C&I lending showed a **continued strong decline**, and commercial clients\u2019 demand weakened [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. In **New York**, overall loan demand declined due to **sagging business-loan demand** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. In **Chicago**, business-loan demand **decreased slightly** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. In contrast, **Cleveland** reported demand **increased moderately** (supported by lower rates) and expected further increases [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15], and **Dallas** reported loan volume and demand **rose modestly** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n### Credit standards and terms\n- **Consumer lending:** Standards/terms were frequently **tightening**, though not everywhere and with some product-specific nuance. In **New York**, banks reported **tightened credit standards** even as consumer demand held steady [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. In **St. Louis**, contacts reported **tightening standards** (e.g., higher equity requirements and more scrutiny) amid rising consumer delinquencies [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. In **Dallas**, overall tightening continued, but **residential real-estate terms eased slightly** while other types tightened [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. In **Kansas City**, banks reported **little to no change** in demand and standards across categories [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Business (C&I) lending:** Standards/terms also tended to **tighten**, and in some places tightening coincided with weakening demand. In **New York**, standards tightened and delinquencies worsened slightly, **especially for business loans** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. In **Chicago**, terms **tightened** even as rates moved down [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. In **St. Louis**, lenders reported **tightening standards** with more scrutiny of **small business loans** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. In **Kansas City**, standards were described as **little changed across categories** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n### Lending volumes/activity\n- **Consumer lending:** Activity ranged from **contraction** to **strong growth**, depending on District and product. In **Atlanta**, consumer lending **contracted further** (despite a small uptick in HELOC applications) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. In **Philadelphia**, consumer lending (excluding auto/cards) **rose strongly** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. In **Dallas**, overall loan volume **increased** and residential real estate was comparatively more accommodative [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Business (C&I) lending:** Activity more often reflected **weakness or caution**, but there were exceptions. In **Philadelphia**, overall lending declines were driven by a **strong decline in C&I** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. In **Richmond**, demand was mostly stable but some saw a **modest increase in commercial-loan demand**, while others cited a \u201c**sideline mentality**\u201d among borrowers [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. In **Cleveland**, activity improved with **moderately higher demand** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n### Credit quality / delinquencies\n- **Consumer lending:** Multiple Districts flagged **rising consumer delinquencies or deterioration**. **Kansas City** noted **moderate deterioration in consumer portfolios** and expected continued challenges as disposable incomes decline [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. **Richmond** cited a **modest increase in delinquencies**, mainly in consumer portfolios (including mortgages and home equity) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. **Atlanta** reported delinquencies **ticked up** though credit quality remained healthy [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. **St. Louis** reported consumer delinquencies **steadily increasing** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Business (C&I) lending:** Where delinquency detail was provided, it was sometimes **more negative for business** than for consumer. In **New York**, delinquencies worsened slightly **especially for business loans** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]. In **Chicago**, business-loan quality **declined modestly** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n### Bottom-line comparison across Districts\n- **Consumer vs. business demand:** Consumer demand was more often **steady/mixed with some growth pockets** (e.g., Philadelphia, Chicago) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15], while business/C&I demand was more often **softer or declining** (notably New York, Philadelphia, Chicago) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15], with a few District exceptions showing improvement (Cleveland, Dallas) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n- **Standards:** Both consumer and business lending saw **tightening** in many Districts, but business lending tightening was frequently described alongside **weaker demand and/or worsening business delinquencies** (e.g., New York, Chicago) [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n*Gap note:* Not every District reported equally detailed splits between consumer and business categories; several summaries discussed \u201coverall\u201d lending or \u201cmost loan types,\u201d limiting direct side-by-side comparisons for those Districts [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer focuses narrowly on how consumer vs business lending differed in four specific districts: Kansas City, Chicago, Dallas, and St. Louis, with particular details (e.g., Kansas City consumer portfolios deteriorating; Chicago business demand down but consumer up; Dallas overall loan demand growing; St. Louis unchanged activity, strong overall credit, some consumer stress, mixed business conditions). The agent\u2019s response instead gives a broad, multi-district synthesis and only partially covers the requested distinctions. It correctly mentions Kansas City\u2019s moderate deterioration in consumer portfolios and Chicago\u2019s slight decrease in business-loan demand with slightly increased consumer demand, and Dallas loan volume/demand rising modestly. However, it does not clearly state that St. Louis\u2019 overall banking activity was unchanged with strong overall credit conditions and mixed business conditions, and it dilutes or omits the concise cross-district comparison structure the question asks for. Because it neither directly answers the specific comparative question as framed nor cleanly reproduces all key district-level contrasts in the expected answer, but does contain some of the key facts, it is best classified as partially_correct.",

      "expected": "In Dallas, price pressures were subdued in services but remained elevated in the manufacturing sector. In Richmond, price growth remained moderate overall despite some pickup in price growth in the manufacturing sector. In Chicago, producer prices grew moderately with contacts reporting moderate nonlabor cost increases including energy and raw materials. Manufacturing contacts attributed some raw materials price increases to tariffs, suggesting tariffs disproportionately affected goods-producing sectors.",
      "answer": "### Price pressures: manufacturing vs. services (Beige Book, Oct. 15, 2025)\n\n| Aspect | Manufacturing sector | Services sector |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Overall intensity of price pressures** | **More elevated.** Multiple Districts described **strong/robust input-cost growth** and tariff-driven pressures. In Kansas City, **input prices grew at a strong pace** for manufacturers [BeigeBook_20251015]. In Cleveland, **nonlabor input costs rose at a robust pace**, frequently tied to tariffs [BeigeBook_20251015]. | **More subdued/moderate.** In Dallas, price pressures were **\u201csubdued in the service sector\u201d** [BeigeBook_20251015]. In Richmond, **year-over-year price growth remained moderate** and service firms reported **virtually no change in price growth** [BeigeBook_20251015]. |\n| **Key drivers of costs** | **Tariffs and goods inputs were central drivers.** Cleveland manufacturers cited tariff-related increases in **raw materials, imported components, and chemical inputs**, plus **rising utilities costs** [BeigeBook_20251015]. New York noted **elevated input prices** and even a production pause due to **high steel prices** [BeigeBook_20251015]. | **Costs rising, but often in service-specific categories and not always showing up immediately in prices.** Dallas reported a services firm facing **health-care and business insurance premiums rising faster than revenues** [BeigeBook_20251015]. Boston showed mixed service categories: **restaurant menu prices mostly unchanged** despite rising costs, **hotel prices down modestly**, while **IT services prices rose moderately** [BeigeBook_20251015]. |\n| **Selling/output price changes** | **More evidence of selling-price increases (though not uniform).** Dallas said selling prices rose slightly overall but **more sharply in manufacturing** due to tariffs [BeigeBook_20251015]. Boston manufacturers\u2019 **output prices increased modestly** [BeigeBook_20251015]. | **Smaller or mixed changes in prices charged.** Richmond service firms reported **virtually no change in price growth** [BeigeBook_20251015]. Philadelphia noted consumer-facing businesses used **more discounts** and reported **lower hotel room rates** [BeigeBook_20251015]. |\n| **Pass-through to customers / pricing power** | **Pass-through was mixed but often more active, including surcharges.** Cleveland reported some manufacturers/wholesalers added **tariff-related surcharges**, while others held prices due to soft demand and price sensitivity [BeigeBook_20251015]. Boston noted **smaller manufacturers passed through a larger share** of tariff-related cost increases [BeigeBook_20251015]. The National Summary emphasized **uneven pass-through**, with some firms fully passing on higher import costs and others holding prices to protect market share [BeigeBook_20251015]. | **More constrained pass-through in many consumer-facing services, with pockets of pricing power.** Philadelphia said businesses were **unable to pass through all cost increases**, instead discounting more [BeigeBook_20251015]. In contrast, Atlanta noted **a few service-oriented firms** could raise prices **without customer pushback** [BeigeBook_20251015]. |\n| **Near-term outlook and persistence into 2026** | **Expectations tilted toward further increases and persistence.** Philadelphia manufacturers\u2019 future prices paid/received indexes were **well above historical averages**, reflecting diminished ability to absorb tariff costs [BeigeBook_20251015]. Atlanta contacts warned tariff pass-through has **\u201cjust begun\u201d** and expected price increases into **2026** [BeigeBook_20251015]. Kansas City manufacturers expected selling-price growth to accelerate and anticipated raising prices in **2026** faster than in 2025 [BeigeBook_20251015]. | **Moderate now, but many expected acceleration over the next year/into 2026.** Dallas service firms expected selling-price increases to **accelerate over the next 12 months** despite subdued current pressures [BeigeBook_20251015]. Kansas City expected services price growth to be **\u201cslightly softer\u201d but still \u201cmoderate,\u201d** with broader acceleration anticipated in **2026** [BeigeBook_20251015]. Atlanta similarly expected tariff-related pass-through to push prices up into **2026** [BeigeBook_20251015]. |\n\n**Bottom line:** Manufacturing price pressures were generally **stronger and more directly tariff/input-cost driven**, with more frequent evidence of price increases and surcharges (though still limited by demand in places) [BeigeBook_20251015]. Services price pressures were typically **more subdued/moderate and mixed across categories**, with cost pressures (insurance/health care/tech and some tariff effects) building but pass-through often constrained\u2014yet with expectations that services inflation could **pick up into 2026** [BeigeBook_20251015].",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer focuses specifically on Dallas, Richmond, and Chicago, and emphasizes: (1) subdued price pressures in services but elevated in manufacturing in Dallas; (2) moderate overall price growth in Richmond with some pickup in manufacturing; and (3) moderate producer price growth in Chicago with moderate nonlabor cost increases, and manufacturing contacts tying some raw materials price increases to tariffs, implying tariffs disproportionately affected goods-producing sectors.\n\nThe agent\u2019s answer correctly captures the broad qualitative pattern that manufacturing price pressures were stronger and more tariff/input-cost driven, while services price pressures were more subdued or moderate, and it explicitly mentions that in Dallas services price pressures were subdued and manufacturing saw sharper increases. It also notes moderate price growth in Richmond services.\n\nHowever, it does not mention Chicago at all, so it omits the specific information about Chicago\u2019s moderate producer prices, moderate nonlabor cost increases (including energy and raw materials), and the explicit point that manufacturing contacts there linked raw materials price increases to tariffs\u2014central elements of the expected answer.

      "question": "How did hiring patterns change, and what does this indicate about employer confidence?",
      "expected": "Employers showed cautious hiring behavior: More employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. Those still hiring favored temporary and part-time workers over full-time employment. In Boston, both hiring and layoffs increased modestly, indicating churn rather than net growth. Employment in IT services increased modestly with hiring in sales and technical positions - a relative bright spot. Jobseekers in Cleveland reported offers were more likely to be part-time with little or no benefits. This pattern indicates employer uncertainty and reluctance to commit to permanent workforce expansion.",
      "answer": "### 2024 \u2192 early 2025 (baseline referenced in the report)\n- **Hours and openings began to look softer than the prior year:** Some employers reduced hours versus 2024 (e.g., Minneapolis-area grocery hours falling to **15\u201318 hours from 20\u201330 hours in 2024**), consistent with easing labor demand rather than aggressive expansion hiring. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n### End of summer 2025 (near-term turning point)\n- **Hiring momentum faded after a brief improvement:** A Minneapolis-area staffing firm reported that **hiring declined at the end of summer after an earlier uptick**, signaling a turn from tentative improvement to renewed cooling.

      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The agent captures most of the key directional information for the Chicago District and its comparison to national trends: overall activity little changed (aligned), consumer spending modestly higher vs national inched down (stronger), manufacturing modestly weaker (consistent with national challenges), employment flat (aligned), wages up modestly (aligned with national modest-to-moderate), prices up moderately (aligned with national rising), and financial conditions slightly looser vs mixed nationally (stronger). However, it misses or mishandles some specifics that the expected answer requires: (1) It does not clearly state that construction/real estate in Chicago \"increased slightly\" and were stronger than the mixed national picture; instead it claims there is no specific directional detail for the District. (2) It omits that farm income prospects in the District were unchanged, instead saying the sub-answers do not include Chicago-specific agriculture directionality. These omissions and claims of missing directionality contradict the expected details, so the response is only partially correct rather than fully correct.",
