[CHUNK: ed01c792-87ea-4517-98cc-75c4d1d65146]\n\nSupporting details:  \n- The header of the report reads: \u201cThe Beige Book \u2013 Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District \u2013 October 2025 \u2013 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM,\u201d which attributes it generally to the Federal Reserve System but does not name an individual Reserve Bank as the preparer. [CHUNK: ed01c792-87ea-4517-98cc-75c4d1d65146]  \n- Separate evidence refers to the \u201cFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\u201d in a different context (\u201cCommunity and Regional Banking\u201d) but does not link this bank to the preparation of the October 2025 Beige Book document.

The extra detail about being published eight times per year does not conflict with the expected answer.",

      "verdict": "incorrect",

      "answer": "**Direct Answer**\n\nBased on the available evidence, the October 2025 Beige Book document is identified, but the retrieved excerpts do not contain a nationwide summary of how overall economic activity changed; only a partial regional summary (Richmond District) is shown, so the change in overall economic activity across all districts cannot be determined from this evidence alone.

[CHUNK: 4768ba1c-f8bd-4e1c-9bf1-7a9e63c3904b]  \n- Its stated purpose is \u201cto characterize the change in economic conditions since the last\u201d report, based on information from a wide range of contacts, and it is not a commentary on Federal Reserve officials\u2019 views. [CHUNK: bb6bfd77-f982-43c7-886e-1de82f2133f6]  \n- For the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond specifically, activity in \u201cthe remaining sectors was generally flat,\u201d manufacturing activity \u201cdeclined slightly,\u201d employment was \u201cunchanged, on balance,\u201d wage growth \u201cremained moderate,\u201d and overall year\u2011over\u2011year price growth \u201cremained within a moderate range.\u201d [CHUNK: e7e8738d-fea3-4a75-bab7-d47a343cecf2]  \n\n**Limitations**\n\n- The evidence does not include the national summary section of the October 2025 Beige Book or district-level summaries beyond Richmond.
