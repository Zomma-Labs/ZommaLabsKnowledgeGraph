      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected_answer": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "system_answer": "From the prior reporting period into mid‑August 2025, and then through September 2025, economic activity in the Twelfth District (San Francisco) moved from relative stability to a slight overall weakening.\n\n**Prior period → mid‑August 2025**  \n- In the period before mid‑August, conditions were stronger than in the subsequent report. The Beige Book characterization that activity had \"edged down\" and that there was a \"modest softening\" compared with the prior report implies that earlier in the summer the regional economy was on a somewhat firmer footing.\n\n**Mid‑August to September 2025**  \n- **Overall economic activity (mid‑Aug to Sept 2025):**  \n  - Activity in the Twelfth District **edged down slightly** over this reporting window, representing a **modest overall weakening** compared with the earlier period. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Sectoral changes:**  \n  - **Retail trade:** Activity **decreased somewhat** over this mid‑August to September span.  \n  - **Agriculture:** Similarly, agricultural activity **declined modestly** during this period.  \n  - **Residential real estate:** Residential real estate activity also **softened**, with somewhat lower activity than in the prior report.  \n  - **Commercial real estate:** In contrast, commercial real estate conditions were **largely stable** relative to the earlier period.  \n  - **Manufacturing:** Manufacturing activity remained **broadly unchanged**, neither expanding nor contracting notably over mid‑August to September.  \n  - **Lending:** Lending volumes and conditions were also **largely stable** in this time frame. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Labor markets, wages, and prices (mid‑Aug to Sept 2025):**  \n  - **Employment:** Overall employment was **little changed**, indicating no major swing in hiring or layoffs in this specific period.  \n  - **Wages:** Wage growth was **slight**, suggesting only modest upward pressure on labor costs.  \n  - **Prices:** Price increases were **modest**, pointing to contained inflationary pressure during the mid‑August to September period.  \n  - **Outlook:** Contacts’ **economic outlook weakened somewhat** relative to the prior period, indicating growing caution about future activity. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Net temporal change**  \n- **Earlier in the summer 2025 vs. mid‑Aug–Sept 2025:** The Twelfth District moved from a relatively firmer position earlier in the summer to a situation by mid‑August through September 2025 in which:  \n  - Overall activity **slightly declined**,  \n  - Key sectors like **retail, agriculture, and residential real estate** saw **somewhat lower activity**, and  \n  - Other sectors—**commercial real estate, manufacturing, and lending**—shifted into or remained in a **stable but not expanding** state.  \n- Over this mid‑August to September 2025 window, the pattern was one of **gradual softening rather than sharp contraction**, with a slightly weaker economic outlook than in the preceding report.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Overall economic activity in the Twelfth District (San Francisco) \"edged down slightly.\"\n2) Activity in retail trade either decreased or remained stable.\n3) Activity in agriculture either decreased or remained stable.\n4) Activity in residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.\n\nComparison with system answer:\n- The system states that economic activity \"moved from relative stability to a slight overall weakening\" and explicitly says activity \"edged down slightly\" and that there was a \"modest overall weakening\". This matches point (1).\n- It states retail trade activity \"decreased somewhat\" over the period, which is consistent with \"decreased\" in point (2).\n- It states agricultural activity \"declined modestly\", consistent with decreased activity in agriculture in point (3).\n- It states residential real estate activity \"softened, with somewhat lower activity\", which matches decreased activity in residential real estate in point (4).\n- The rest of the answer adds extra sectoral details (commercial real estate, manufacturing, lending, labor markets, prices, outlook), but these do not contradict any part of the expected answer; they are simply additional context.\n\nNo factual contradictions with the expected answer appear; all key points are captured correctly and even phrased very similarly (edged down slightly; decreased/softened in the specified sectors). Therefore, the answer is fully correct, just more detailed than required.\n",
