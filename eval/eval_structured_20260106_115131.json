      "answer": "**Direct Answer**\n\nBased on the available evidence, the October 2025 Beige Book is identified only as a system-wide Federal Reserve document (\u201cFEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM\u201d) and the evidence does **not** state which specific Federal Reserve Bank prepared that particular report. [CHUNK: ed01c792-87ea-4517-98cc-75c4d1d65146]\n\n**Supporting Details**\n\n- The document header reads: \u201cThe Beige Book \u2013 Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District \u2013 October 2025 \u2013 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM,\u201d but no preparing Reserve Bank is named. [CHUNK: ed01c792-87ea-4517-98cc-75c4d1d65146]  \n- The other evidence refers to \u201cFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City > Community and Regional Banking,\u201d but this is a separate context about district banks\u2019 conditions and does not say that the Kansas City Fed prepared the October 2025 Beige Book. [CHUNK: f504bda0-f795-44a9-936c-cec770f66e18]\n\n**Limitations**\n\nBased on the available evidence, there is no explicit statement identifying which Federal Reserve Bank prepared the October 2025 Beige Book, so this cannot be determined from the provided text.

      "answer": "Direct Answer:  \n\nBased on the available evidence, the number of Federal Reserve Districts covered in the Beige Book is not stated, so the question cannot be answered from this material.\n\nSupporting Details (from the evidence):  \n- The Beige Book is described as a \u201cSummary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District,\u201d but no count of districts is provided.

      "expected": "Economic activity changed little on balance since the previous report, with three Districts reporting slight to modest growth in activity, five reporting no change, and four noting a slight softening.",
      "answer": "**Direct Answer**\n\nBased on the available evidence, the October 2025 Beige Book document itself is identified, but the provided excerpts do not include its national summary or any explicit statement on how overall U.S. economic activity changed since the prior report. [CHUNK: ed01c792-87ea-4517-98cc-75c4d1d65146] As a result, the change in overall economic activity according to the October 2025 Beige Book cannot be determined from the evidence provided.\n\n**Supporting Details**\n\n- The document is labeled \u201cThe Beige Book \u2013 Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District \u2013 October 2025,\u201d confirming it is the October 2025 edition. [CHUNK: ed01c792-87ea-4517-98cc-75c4d1d65146]  \n- The Beige Book is described as a Federal Reserve System publication about current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts, characterizing regional economic conditions and prospects based on mostly qualitative information. [CHUNK: 4768ba1c-f8bd-4e1c-9bf1-7a9e63c3904b]  \n- Its stated purpose is \u201cto characterize the change in economic conditions since the last\u201d report, based on information collected from a wide range of contacts. [CHUNK: bb6bfd77-f982-43c7-886e-1de82f2133f6] This confirms that the October 2025 Beige Book should discuss changes in activity, but the specific characterization of overall activity is not shown in the excerpts.  \n- One regional example (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond) notes that, in that District, \u201cmanufacturing activity declined slightly,\u201d \u201cactivity in the remaining sectors was generally flat,\u201d and \u201cemployment was unchanged, on balance,\u201d with wage growth moderate and overall year-over-year price growth in a moderate range. [CHUNK: e7e8738d-fea3-4a75-bab7-d47a343cecf2] However, this refers only to the Richmond District, not to the national economy.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nBased on the available evidence, the key national summary language that would state how \u201coverall economic activity\u201d changed in the October 2025 Beige Book is not included. The excerpts describe the purpose and structure of the Beige Book and provide one District\u2019s summary, but they do not report the overall U.S. economic activity characterization (e.g., whether it was flat, expanded, or contracted). Therefore, the specific answer to how overall economic activity changed, as characterized in the October 2025 Beige Book, cannot be fully determined from the provided material.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer states that overall economic activity changed little on balance, with a breakdown of District reports (3 slight/modest growth, 5 no change, 4 slight softening). The agent instead claims the change cannot be determined from provided excerpts and does not provide the Beige Book\u2019s actual national summary characterization or the District-count breakdown.

      "answer": "**Direct Answer**\n\nBased on the available evidence, none of the referenced districts are reported as having overall \u201cslight to modest economic growth\u201d; the Cleveland (Fourth) District is described as having *flat* business activity, and the Atlanta (Sixth) District economy is described as *unchanged*.[CHUNK: 6b748b97-7661-41ed-845f-99939e01859f][CHUNK: 4b78ed98-489a-447e-90ea-ba7b4e9165f0]\n\n**Supporting Details**\n\n- For the Cleveland (Fourth) District, \u201cFourth District contact reports suggested flat business activity in recent weeks, but contacts expected activity to increase modestly in the months ahead.\u201d[CHUNK: 6b748b97-7661-41ed-845f-99939e01859f] This indicates no current growth, only an expectation of modest increase in the future.\n- For the Atlanta (Sixth) District, \u201cThe Sixth District economy was unchanged.\u201d[CHUNK: 4b78ed98-489a-447e-90ea-ba7b4e9165f0] An unchanged economy does not indicate slight or modest growth.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nBased on the available evidence, only the Cleveland and Atlanta district summaries are provided, and broader Beige Book coverage of other districts is not included. Therefore, it is not possible to identify which other districts, if any, reported slight to modest economic growth from this evidence alone.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer specifies that Boston (First), Philadelphia (Third), and Richmond (Fifth) reported slight to modest growth. The agent instead claims none did, citing only Cleveland (flat) and Atlanta (unchanged) and arguing insufficient evidence. This contradicts the expected districts and fails to identify them.",
