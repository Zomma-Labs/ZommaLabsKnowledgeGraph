Summary of Economic Activity).\n\n- **Heightened vulnerability to policy and price changes**\n  - Planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid \u201cposed additional risks to low- and moderate-income households\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Community Perspectives).\n  - Further increases in consumer prices, including those linked to tariffs, also \u201cposed additional risks\u201d to these households (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Community Perspectives).\n  - District contacts noted that prevailing childcare prices \u201cremained difficult for low- and moderate-income families to afford\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Community Conditions).\n\n- **Debt stress and credit problems**\n  - Community contacts reported **elevated credit card delinquency rates** among consumers (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Consumer Spending).\n  - Financial institutions observed **modest increases in loan delinquencies**, mainly in consumer portfolios such as mortgages and home equity loans (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Banking and Finance).\n  - A banker reported an increase in the number of people going to **credit counseling agencies after borrowing to maintain requirements** (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Banking and Finance).\n\n- **Labor market and employment quality**\n  - Respondents who assist jobseekers observed clients were \u201cmore likely than before to receive offers for part-time positions with little or no benefits\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Community Conditions).\n  - Economic precarity in many communities was rising, reflected in both increased food pantry use and anxiety about future conditions (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Community Perspectives).\n\n**Middle-income and mid\u2011 to upper\u2011income households**\n\nEvidence on middle-income households is more mixed and often inferred from references to \u201cmid\u2011 to upper\u2011income\u201d or \u201cmiddle\u2011class\u201d consumers:\n\n- **Resilience in aggregate spending but selective pullbacks**\n  - The Federal Reserve Bank of New York attributed part of the **increase in overall consumer spending** to the \u201cresilience of mid\u2011 to upper\u2011income households\u201d (Summary of Economic Activity).\n  - A department store similarly attributed stronger sales partly to resilience among \u201cmid\u2011 to upper\u2011income consumers\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Prices).\n  - At the same time, a hotel owner in Missouri reported that a **dip in travel demand was especially pronounced among middle-class consumers** (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Consumer Spending), indicating cutbacks in discretionary travel.\n\n- **Managing higher borrowing costs and debt**\n  - Community contacts reported **elevated credit card delinquencies** among consumers (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Consumer Spending); the findings do not break this out by income but are relevant to household debt stress.\n  - Financial institutions noted **modest increases in delinquencies** in consumer portfolios (mortgages and home equity loans) (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Banking and Finance).\n  - Home equity lines increased moderately (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Credit Conditions), and borrowers were \u201cpaying down lines of credit and looking to keep more cash on hand\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Credit Conditions), indicating adjustments in how households manage credit and liquidity.\n\n- **Housing and interest-rate-related behavior**\n  - A real estate broker reported that \u201ccurrent homeowners did not want to give up their lower mortgage interest rates by selling their homes\u201d and remained reluctant to sell to avoid losing low rates (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Real Estate and Construction). While not explicitly labeled as middle-income, this behavior is consistent with existing homeowners\u2019 responses to higher rates.\n\n- **Spending adjustments and income pressures**\n  - District banks expected **consumer lending to face challenges** as disposable income levels decrease (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Community and Regional Banking).\n  - Consumers generally were \u201clooking for ways to stretch their dollars\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Consumer Spending), which applies to households beyond just the lowest incomes.\n  - A hotel contact\u2019s observation that middle-class travel demand fell suggests middle-income households cut some discretionary spending even as aggregate mid\u2011 to upper\u2011income spending remained relatively resilient (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Consumer Spending; Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Summary of Economic Activity).\n\n**Cross\u2011group patterns tied to economic conditions**\n\nAcross the income distribution, but with **stronger adverse effects on lower\u2011income households**, the findings show:\n\n- **Inflation and higher prices** eroded purchasing power and led to spending reductions and \u201cstretching dollars,\u201d with low- and moderate-income households most at risk (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Community Perspectives; Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Summary of Economic Activity; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Consumer Spending).\n- **Rising borrowing costs and tighter finances** were associated with increased credit card and loan delinquencies and more people seeking credit counseling, again particularly affecting borrowers with lower personal incomes (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Consumer Spending and Banking and Finance; Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Banking and Finance; Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Community Conditions; Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Community and Regional Banking).\n- **Labor market softening and job quality issues** (more part-time offers with limited benefits, reduced hours in some settings, and more temporary hiring due to uncertainty) contributed to economic precarity for lower- and middle-income jobseekers (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Community Conditions; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Labor Markets; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Labor Markets).\n\nWhere the findings are silent\u2014for example, precise savings rates or detailed distinctions within \u201cmiddle-income\u201d beyond the cited anecdotes\u2014no additional conclusions can be drawn from the available evidence.",

The Philadelphia Fed reported that only luxury leisure travel experienced growth, while Boston Fed tourism contacts noted that overall growth in accommodations demand was fueled almost entirely by luxury accommodations, with a widening gap between luxury and budget-friendly options. A hotel owner in Missouri (St. Louis Fed) observed that the dip in travel demand was especially pronounced among middle-class consumers.\n\nSegment-specific information shows that:\n- Hotel occupancy levels were trending downward on net (Atlanta Fed), even as demand for hotel rooms in New York City edged up and neared 2019 levels with exceptionally high room rates (New York Fed).\n- A modest decline in international visitors to New York City took a toll on restaurants and attractions (New York Fed).\n- Slower foot traffic in tourist destination areas reduced travel-related retail spending (San Francisco Fed).\n- Business travel and group travel were reported as flat (Atlanta Fed), in contrast to the declining international leisure segment.\n\nOverall, the findings indicate that demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers has continued to decline, remains below pre\u2011pandemic benchmarks, and is weak across most segments except for luxury leisure travel, which is providing most of the sector\u2019s growth.",

      "answer": "Manufacturing demand in the Chicago District was driven primarily by:\n\n1. **Weakness in the automotive sector (key negative driver)**  \n   * Overall manufacturing demand in the Chicago District \u201cdeclined modestly in late August and September.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing)  \n   * Within that, the automotive sector was a major drag:\n     * \u201cAuto production was down modestly in late August and September.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing)  \n     * \u201cThe decline in machinery orders in late August and September was driven by a decline in demand from the automotive industry.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing)  \n     * \u201cFabricated metals had lower sales to the automotive industry in late August and September, further offsetting higher sales to other sectors.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing)  \n     * In banking and finance commentary, \u201cmultiple contacts noted weaknesses among suppliers in the auto industry in late August and September,\u201d and \u201cthe auto industry\u201d was identified as the sector where \u201csuppliers were experiencing reported weaknesses.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Banking and Finance)  \n\n   Together, these reports indicate that reduced demand from the auto industry was a central factor behind weaker machinery orders, lower fabricated metal sales, and the modest overall decline in manufacturing demand.\n\n2. **Construction-related demand, which was flat to slightly negative for some inputs**  \n   * \u201cFabricated metals had lower sales to the construction industry in late August and September, which contributed to offsetting the higher sales to other sectors.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing)  \n   * \u201cSteel orders were flat overall in late August and September.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing)  \n   * \u201cFabricated metals demand was unchanged on balance in late August and September, as offsetting factors resulted in no net change.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing)  \n\n   This evidence shows that construction-related demand did not provide a strong positive impulse; instead, flat steel orders and weaker construction sales in fabricated metals limited overall manufacturing demand.\n\n3. **Tariff\u2011driven metals price increases (an important cost and indirect demand factor)**  \n   * Within the Chicago District, \u201cmanufacturing contacts attributed the increases in metals prices to tariffs.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Prices)  \n   * Across District reports generally, \u201cfirms in manufacturing fully passed higher import costs along to their customers in some cases.\u201d (Prices > Body)  \n\n   While the Chicago manufacturing section does not explicitly link tariffs to a specific volume change in orders, the Chicago Fed\u2019s own price commentary attributes metals price increases to tariffs, and broader Federal Reserve evidence indicates that tariff\u2011related cost pressures have been associated with modest demand declines elsewhere (for example, \u201cmanufacturers reported modest declines in demand for goods, which they attributed to tariffs\u201d in the Cleveland District; Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Summary of Economic Activity). Thus, in the Chicago context, tariffs mainly show up as a driver of higher metals costs that manufacturers sometimes passed on to customers, influencing pricing and, by implication, demand conditions.\n\n4. **Sectoral offsetting forces outside autos and construction**  \n   * For fabricated metals overall, despite lower sales to autos and construction, \u201cfabricated metals experienced higher sales to a range of sectors in late August and September,\u201d but \u201cfabricated metals demand was unchanged on balance,\u201d showing that stronger demand in some sectors was offset by weakness in auto and construction. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing)  \n\n   The findings do not specify which non\u2011auto, non\u2011construction sectors drove these higher fabricated metals sales, only that they were \u201ca range of sectors.\u201d\n\n5. **Agricultural context in the District (relevant background, not a direct manufacturing boost in the findings)**  \n   * \u201cAgriculture in the District was reported to be in good shape across most of the District.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Agriculture)  \n   * At the same time, \u201ccorn prices in the District were down despite strong export volumes,\u201d and \u201csoybean prices in the District were lower, in part due to the absence of new-crop soybean exports to China.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Agriculture)  \n\n   These agricultural conditions illustrate mixed external demand and price dynamics in a key regional sector, but the manufacturing findings provided do not directly link this to specific changes in manufactured goods demand (e.g., for agricultural equipment), so any such linkage cannot be asserted from the evidence.\n\n6. **Broader macro and uncertainty factors (from other Districts, context only)**  \n   * In other Districts, manufacturers \u201creported modest declines in demand for goods, which they attributed to tariffs.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Summary of Economic Activity)  \n   * \u201cTariffs were cited by contacts as a headwind for manufacturing and related services.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Manufacturing and Related Services)  \n   * \u201cUncertainty was cited by contacts as a headwind for manufacturing and related services.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Manufacturing and Related Services)  \n\n   These findings show that, system\u2011wide, tariffs and uncertainty were important headwinds for manufacturing demand. The Chicago reports explicitly connect tariffs to higher metals prices, but do not explicitly state that Chicago manufacturers themselves attribute their demand decline to tariffs or uncertainty; therefore, this causal link for Chicago can only be treated as contextual, not confirmed.\n\n**Direct answer, restricted to what is specified for the Chicago District**\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\u2019s manufacturing commentary, the modest decline in manufacturing demand in the Chicago District in late August and September was driven mainly by:\n\n* A notable decline in demand from the automotive industry, which reduced machinery orders, cut auto production, and lowered fabricated metal sales to auto suppliers, with related weakness among auto suppliers. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Banking and Finance)  \n* Weaker sales to the construction industry and flat steel orders, which, together with auto\u2011related weakness, kept fabricated metals demand flat on balance despite stronger sales to other sectors. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing)  \n* Higher metals prices attributed by Chicago manufacturing contacts to tariffs, which raised input costs and, in the broader Federal Reserve context, are associated with demand headwinds, although the Chicago reports do not explicitly state that tariffs directly caused the observed demand decline. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Prices; Prices > Body; Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Summary of Economic Activity)",

      "expected": "Several manufacturers noted that changing tariff policies were making it difficult to plan for the future.",
      "answer": "Manufacturers faced several distinct challenges related to tariff policies, as reported across multiple Federal Reserve Districts:\n\n1. **Higher input and operating costs**\n   * Tariffs directly raised costs for imported raw materials, metals, components, and supplies, increasing manufacturers\u2019 input and operating costs.  \n     *Examples:*  \n     \u2013 Manufacturers and other firms repeatedly cited tariffs as adding to their input costs (Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond, Philadelphia).  \n     \u2013 Manufacturing contacts specifically attributed increases in metals prices to tariffs (Chicago).  \n     \u2013 Higher import duties increased the cost of imported supplies such as raw materials and electrical and electronic components (San Francisco).  \n     \u2013 Smaller manufacturers experienced tariff\u2011induced cost increases (Boston).  \n     \u2013 Firms reported cost pressures from tariffs alongside other rising business expenses (Philadelphia; Atlanta).\n\n2. **Need to raise selling prices and manage pricing pressure**\n   * To cope with higher costs, manufacturers often increased their own prices.  \n     *Examples:*  \n     \u2013 Tariffs contributed to \u201csharper selling price increases\u201d in the manufacturing sector (Dallas; Richmond).  \n     \u2013 Several manufacturers recently raised prices in response to tariffs (Minneapolis).  \n     \u2013 Manufacturers introduced price increases specifically to cover elevated input costs (Cleveland).  \n   * Some firms could not fully pass costs on, and had to absorb tariff\u2011related increases:  \n     \u2013 Some auto manufacturers reported absorbing tariff\u2011related increases to avoid further declines in demand (Atlanta).\n\n3. **Reduced demand for manufactured goods**\n   * Manufacturers reported that tariffs contributed to weaker demand.  \n     *Examples:*  \n     \u2013 Manufacturers in the Cleveland District reported modest declines in demand for their goods, which they explicitly attributed to tariffs (Cleveland).  \n     \u2013 Tariff\u2011driven cost increases and resulting price hikes were associated with softer demand in some markets (Cleveland; Minneapolis, via price increases and demand concerns).\n\n4. **Supply chain and sourcing disruptions**\n   * Tariffs forced changes in sourcing strategies and production logistics.  \n     *Examples:*  \n     \u2013 Many businesses worked with vendors to find alternative inputs in order to mitigate tariff\u2011related cost increases (New York).  \n     \u2013 Contacts reported shipping unfinished goods to the U.S. for final assembly to manage tariffs, shipping, and labor dynamics (St. Louis).  \n   * These adjustments indicate disruption and added complexity in manufacturers\u2019 supply chains.\n\n5. **Administrative and classification problems with tariff implementation**\n   * Some manufacturers faced challenges related to how tariffs were applied.  \n     *Examples:*  \n     \u2013 A computer manufacturer reported that U.S. customs was applying steel and aluminum tariffs to products that do not contain steel or aluminum, and that challenges to these tariffs were taking time to resolve (Dallas).\n\n6. **Competitive pressures and market\u2011share effects**\n   * Tariff\u2011driven changes in pricing behavior affected competitive dynamics.  \n     *Examples:*  \n     \u2013 Two contacts reported that foreign producers cut prices to retain market share in the face of tariffs (Cleveland).  \n     \u2013 Some suppliers raised prices while citing tariffs as justification even when their goods were not actually subject to higher duties (Philadelphia).  \n   * These developments placed additional margin and competitive pressures on manufacturers purchasing from those suppliers.\n\n7. **Uncertainty and weaker business outlooks / investment headwinds**\n   * Tariff policy uncertainty itself was a major challenge for manufacturers\u2019 planning and outlooks.  \n     *Examples:*  \n     \u2013 Domestic policy uncertainty, with tariffs identified as a primary driver, continued to weigh on manufacturing outlooks (Dallas).  \n     \u2013 Tariffs and related uncertainty were cited as a \u201cheadwind for manufacturing and related services\u201d (Boston).  \n     \u2013 Tariffs appeared to be one of the primary drivers of uncertainty for business contacts (Dallas).  \n     \u2013 In a manufacturing survey, firms reported that uncertainty (to which tariff policy contributed) was a moderate or significant constraint on capacity utilization (Philadelphia).  \n     \u2013 Heightened uncertainty was described as a headwind for investment (Kansas City, in the broader business context).\n\nOverall, across these Federal Reserve sources, manufacturers\u2019 main tariff\u2011related challenges were: higher input and operating costs, pressure to raise or absorb prices, reduced demand, disrupted supply chains and sourcing, implementation and classification problems, intensified competitive pressures, and policy uncertainty that weighed on outlooks and investment decisions.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",

      "expected": "Employers that reported hiring generally noted improved labor availability, and some favored hiring temporary and part-time workers over offering full-time employment opportunities.",
      "answer": "Employers\u2019 hiring preferences shifted in four main ways in the recent period covered by the findings (primarily U.S. Federal Reserve District contacts over the last few years):\n\n1. **From expansion to replacement-only hiring, with more selectivity**\n   * Across multiple Federal Reserve districts (Cleveland, Minneapolis, San Francisco, New York), contacts reported that most hiring was to **backfill positions due to normal turnover**, not to expand headcount.  \n     * Example: A contact in Montana said hiring to replace vacancies **\u201cdominated\u201d** over hiring for business expansion; a staffing contact in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula said employers were **predominantly hiring to replace turnover rather than for expansion**, and that **only one in ten** employers were hiring new full-time employees.  \n     * The San Francisco Fed reported that **most employers hired only to replace workers**, holding headcounts steady.\n   * As labor demand softened in several districts (Minneapolis, Chicago), employers became more **selective**:\n     * Chicago Fed contacts reported that **\u201chiring was selective\u201d** and that **existing workers were more likely to stay**, which further supported selective hiring.\n     * San Francisco Fed contacts noted that **the number of applicants per opening increased**, and employers **found it easier to hire**, reinforcing the shift to more selective choices among a larger applicant pool.\n\n2. **Greater emphasis on retention and non-full-time/low-benefit roles**\n   * Employers increasingly **prioritized retention of experienced employees**:\n     * The San Francisco Fed reported that \u201csome contacts highlighted efforts by employers to **prioritize the retention of experienced employees**.\u201d\n   * Simultaneously, offers shifted toward **part-time and lower-benefit positions**:\n     * Cleveland Fed community contacts who assist jobseekers observed that clients were **more likely than before to receive offers for part-time positions with little or no benefits**.\n   * In some areas, **temporary hiring** increased amid uncertainty:\n     * A staffing contact in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula reported that **uncertainty in the market spurred more temporary hiring**.\n\n3. **Shift in skill and experience focus driven by AI and technology adoption**\n   * Employers\u2019 preferences shifted toward **highly specialized technical skills**, particularly related to AI and IT services:\n     * Boston Fed software/IT contacts reported **strong demand for software and IT services**, attributing this to the **essential nature** of these services and **spillover IT investments related to AI adoption**.\n     * San Francisco Fed contacts noted **wage pressures persisting for highly specialized positions, such as in AI technology**, even as wage pressures softened elsewhere.\n   * At the same time, AI adoption is reducing demand for **entry-level and less-experienced roles**:\n     * A Minnesota advertising firm (Minneapolis Fed) said there would be a **smaller need for entry-level workers because AI tools get the work done faster**, and stated that **AI tools get entry-level work done faster**.\n     * San Francisco Fed contacts reported that **investment in artificial intelligence was targeted to positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees**, and that **employment reductions were accompanied by AI investments for those tasks**.\n     * Kansas City Fed contacts in professional services indicated that **adoption and implementation of AI capabilities reduced overall labor needs**, with recent layoffs tied to AI implementation.\n   * Overall, this indicates that employers are **shifting preferences toward more specialized, experienced talent** in areas like AI and IT, while **relying on AI tools to handle work previously done by entry-level staff**.\n\n4. **Cautious hiring under softer but uneven labor demand**\n   * Economic uncertainty and softening demand led to **cautious, needs-based hiring**:\n     * Minneapolis and Chicago Fed reports noted **softening labor demand** and **softening labor market conditions** in many industries.\n     * Atlanta Fed contacts cited **uncertainty around consumer demand and labor supply** weighing on hiring plans, and more frequent **headcount reductions** as demand slowed.\n     * Dallas Fed contacts reported that firms had **been holding off on hiring longer than usual**, leaving unspent budgets.\n   * Where demand remained strong, preferences were shaped by sector-specific needs:\n     * Minneapolis Fed contacts highlighted **healthy labor demand in manufacturing, construction, and mining** in some areas, with **continued wage pressures for some lower-wage construction and manufacturing jobs** (San Francisco Fed).\n     * New York Fed contacts reported **solid labor demand for workers in finance and accounting**, while also noting **soft labor demand for tech workers** in their region.\n\nWhat the findings do *not* specify:\n- They do not provide systematic evidence on changes in formal education or degree requirements.\n- They do not provide direct evidence on employers\u2019 preferences regarding remote vs. in-person or hybrid work.\n- They do not detail how diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) goals changed specific hiring preferences, only that the Fed seeks diverse information sources.\n- They do not systematically quantify changes in demand for specific soft skills (e.g., adaptability, problem-solving), beyond the broad patterns above.\n\nIn summary, across the cited Federal Reserve sources, employer hiring preferences have moved toward:\n- **Backfilling and retention** rather than growth hiring,\n- **More selective hiring** from a larger applicant pool,\n- **Increased use of part-time, temporary, and lower-benefit roles**, and\n- **Greater emphasis on specialized, especially AI-related, skills with reduced reliance on entry-level labor** as AI tools are adopted.",

      "question": "How did tariffs affect prices across districts?",
      "expected": "Tariff-induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts, but the extent of those higher costs passing through to final prices varied. Some firms kept selling prices unchanged to preserve market share, while others fully passed higher import costs to customers.",
      "answer": "Across Federal Reserve Districts, tariffs primarily affected prices by raising firms\u2019 input costs, with uneven pass-through to customers and notable regional differences:\n\n1. **Common pattern across districts: higher input costs from tariffs**\n   - Firms in multiple districts\u2014Richmond, Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Cleveland, Dallas, and others\u2014reported that tariffs were adding to input costs and broader cost pressures:\n     - Richmond: firms in both sectors \u201ccontinued to cite tariffs as adding to their input costs,\u201d and tariffs were a factor in the pickup in manufacturing price growth.  \n     - Boston: contacts repeatedly mentioned tariff-related cost pressures, including upward pressure on construction costs and manufacturing costs.  \n     - Philadelphia: firms cited tariffs as a source of continued cost pressures.  \n     - Cleveland: retail contacts reported tariff-driven cost increases on items like beef and coffee; manufacturing contacts tied metals price increases to tariffs.  \n     - Dallas: tariffs contributed to sharper selling price increases in manufacturing, with some steel and aluminum tariffs even applied to products not containing those metals.\n\n2. **How much of these cost increases were passed through to prices varied by district and firm**\n   - The Beige Book evidence (summarized across districts) states that \u201cthe extent to which tariff-induced input cost increases were passed through to final prices varied across firms and markets.\u201d\n   - Specific district evidence:\n     - **Richmond**: some tariff-driven input cost increases \u201chad not yet been passed along to customers,\u201d even as firms reported rising input costs.\n     - **Atlanta**: firms noted they were passing tariff-related cost increases to customers; contacts warned that tariff-related price pass-through \u201chad just begun\u201d and expected prices to continue rising into 2026 due to ongoing pass-through. Some auto manufacturers in this district reported absorbing tariff-related increases instead of passing them on.\n     - **Boston**: smaller manufacturers experienced tariff-induced cost increases and \u201cpassed through a larger share\u201d of these costs to customers over the period discussed.\n     - **Chicago**: several smaller retailers had already raised prices because of tariffs, even while \u201cin general, retailers were trying to hold off passing tariff-related cost increases on to consumers for as long as possible.\u201d\n     - **San Francisco** (via sector evidence): retailers passed a sizable portion of cost increases on to consumers, mainly in mid- to high-end markets.\n   - In aggregate Beige Book language: in some cases, firms in manufacturing and retail \u201cfully passed higher import costs along to their customers,\u201d but in other cases they absorbed or delayed pass-through.\n\n3. **District-specific price effects and sectoral channels**\n   - **Manufacturing-intensive districts (e.g., Dallas, Richmond, Boston, Chicago)**:\n     - Tariffs, especially on metals and imported inputs, produced sharper selling price increases in manufacturing (Dallas) and were cited as a factor in faster manufacturing price growth (Richmond).\n     - Manufacturing contacts in Chicago attributed metals price increases to tariffs.\n     - Boston manufacturing and related services reported tariffs as a headwind contributing to higher costs and prices.\n   - **Retail and consumer-facing sectors (e.g., Chicago, Cleveland, Boston, San Francisco)**:\n     - Chicago: smaller retailers raised prices because of tariffs.\n     - Cleveland: retailers saw higher costs for tariff-affected goods such as beef and coffee.\n     - Beige Book synthesis: in some districts, retail firms fully passed higher import costs to customers.\n   - **Construction and real estate (Boston)**:\n     - Boston: tariffs contributed to upward pressure on construction costs, alongside labor shortages, implying higher project and related prices in that district.\n   - **Agriculture and trade-exposed rural areas (Minneapolis, Chicago, Kansas City, Atlanta)**:\n     - Minneapolis and Chicago districts experienced adverse price effects in agriculture tied to retaliatory trade actions: agricultural contacts in the Minneapolis District were concerned about the elimination of Chinese purchases of soybeans; in the Chicago District, new-crop soybean exports to China were absent and soybean prices were lower in part because of this absence.\n     - These developments meant depressed farm-gate prices for crops like soybeans in those districts, even as tariffs elsewhere raised input and output prices for manufacturers and retailers.\n     - Trade policy volatility weighed on agricultural exports in the Atlanta District, with Chinese markets turning to Brazil for soybeans and other commodities, keeping soybean prices \u201cdepressed\u201d in that region as well.\n\n4. **Timing and incomplete pass-through**\n   - Across districts, many contacts emphasized that tariff-related price effects were still unfolding:\n     - Atlanta contacts warned that price pass-through from tariffs \u201chad just begun.\u201d\n     - Richmond noted that some tariff-driven cost increases were still not being passed through.\n     - Philadelphia contacts expected further tariff impacts in coming months.\n   - A cross-district synthesis indicates that tariff-induced input cost increases were in various stages of being passed through: some sectors and firms (especially smaller manufacturers and some retailers) had already increased prices; others were strategizing about pricing (New York) or holding off as long as possible (Chicago).\n\n5. **Overall inflation and distributional concerns across districts**\n   - Several districts linked tariffs to broader price growth and inflation pressures:\n     - Dallas: selling prices in manufacturing rose more sharply than overall, with tariffs cited as a contributor.\n     - Richmond: tariffs were associated with a pickup in manufacturing price growth.\n     - Boston: district-level prices rose at a moderate pace, with tariff-related cost pressures named as part of that picture; community perspectives there explicitly linked tariffs to further increases in consumer prices.\n   - Boston\u2019s community perspectives also emphasized that further tariff-linked increases in consumer prices posed \u201cadditional risks to low- and moderate-income households,\u201d indicating that in this district, the price effects from tariffs were viewed as particularly burdensome for more vulnerable consumers.\n\n6. **Regional differences in reported tariff impact**\n   - The Atlanta District is explicitly noted as having **heterogeneous** experiences: some firms reported \u201clittle to no tariff impacts so far,\u201d while others were already passing costs through and expecting more price increases.\n   - In contrast, districts like Richmond, Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas consistently reported tariffs as an important driver of higher costs and, in manufacturing especially, higher selling prices.\n   - Minneapolis and Chicago showed a different channel\u2014lower prices for certain agricultural commodities (not higher consumer prices) due to lost export markets linked to retaliatory measures.\n\nIn summary, across Federal Reserve Districts, tariffs generally raised input costs and contributed to higher selling prices, especially in manufacturing, construction, and some retail sectors. The size and timing of the resulting price increases differed by district, sector, and firm: some districts and firms had already passed through most tariff costs to customers, others were partially doing so or delaying, and agricultural regions experienced depressed crop prices due to lost export demand rather than higher domestic prices.",

      "expected": "Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity.",
      "answer": "Residential real estate and commercial real estate showed different but broadly subdued conditions, based on recent Federal Reserve district reports.\n\n**Residential real estate**\n\n- **Sales activity:** Existing and new home sales were flat or down slightly in several districts. Existing home sales declined slightly in the Philadelphia District (Philadelphia Fed). Home sales were flat or down slightly overall in the Boston District as of August (Boston Fed), declined moderately in the Atlanta District (Atlanta Fed), and were lower overall in the Minneapolis District (Minneapolis Fed). Residential real estate activity decreased somewhat in the San Francisco District (San Francisco Fed), and agents in the St. Louis District described the residential market as slow (St. Louis Fed).\n\n- **Prices:** House prices were still rising but at a slower pace. In the Boston District, house prices rose moderately from a year earlier, with growth somewhat slower than in the previous report (Boston Fed).\n\n- **Inventory:** Housing inventory increased in some areas. The Boston District saw housing inventories increase sharply from the previous August, extending an earlier trend (Boston Fed). The Richmond District reported improved residential inventories (Richmond Fed). At the same time, contacts in the Philadelphia District still cited a lack of inventory as a major headwind (Philadelphia Fed).\n\n- **Mortgage rates and behavior:** In the Dallas District, mortgage rates dipped recently, but housing market activity remained weak despite this (Dallas Fed). A broker in the Cleveland District noted that current homeowners were reluctant to sell because they did not want to give up their lower mortgage interest rates (Cleveland Fed). Builders in the Dallas District used mortgage-rate buydowns as incentives to close deals (Dallas Fed). District banks reported mortgages ticking up slightly in the Philadelphia District (Philadelphia Fed), and a Cleveland contact expected lower mortgage rates to increase mortgage demand (Cleveland Fed). Credit standards for residential real estate loans eased slightly in September in the Dallas District (Dallas Fed).\n\n- **New construction:** Home starts slowed further in the Dallas District (Dallas Fed). Permits for new residential projects were notably lower in the Minneapolis District (Minneapolis Fed). A developer in Memphis said new multifamily construction had plummeted (St. Louis Fed). San Francisco District contacts reported that demand for new residential real estate decreased somewhat and that residential real estate activity decreased somewhat overall (San Francisco Fed). In the Atlanta District, muted demand for new starter homes persisted, while cost inflation on new home construction stayed relatively low (Atlanta Fed).\n\n- **Market segmentation:** In the St. Louis District, higher-end homes were reported as \u201cnot moving,\u201d while lower-priced homes were selling quickly unless they needed repairs (St. Louis Fed).\n\n- **Rental market:** Apartment rents in the Boston District rose only slightly, representing a slowdown from earlier in the year (Boston Fed). In the Dallas District, rental rates for apartments were under pressure because leasing was competitive amid elevated new supply; apartment demand there was steady (Dallas Fed). The Chicago District reported slightly higher vacancy rates and unchanged commercial-market rents (Chicago Fed). In the New York District, rents continued to rise, with New York City rents at historic highs (New York Fed), and contacts expected some reduction in rental demand in coming months as mortgage rates eased (New York Fed).\n\nOverall, across districts, residential conditions were characterized by flat-to-declining sales, moderating but still positive price growth, increasing inventories in some areas, slower new construction, and mixed but generally firm rental conditions, with some markets facing higher vacancy from new supply.\n\n**Commercial real estate**\n\n- **Overall activity and momentum:** Several districts described commercial real estate (CRE) as flat or unchanged. The Minneapolis District reported that commercial real estate was flat, with a lack of new construction across most sectors providing stability for existing properties but little growth for the overall market (Minneapolis Fed). The San Francisco District reported commercial real estate activity was unchanged on balance (San Francisco Fed). The Minneapolis Summary of Economic Activity likewise characterized Ninth District CRE conditions as flat since the previous report (Minneapolis Fed). The St. Louis District described commercial real estate activity as mixed (St. Louis Fed). The Kansas City District reported commercial real estate activity had declined moderately over the past six months (Kansas City Fed). The New York District reported that commercial real estate markets continued to improve (New York Fed). The Atlanta District noted that commercial real estate activity occurred amid uneven market dynamics (Atlanta Fed).\n\n- **Sector differences:** In the Richmond District, agents said retail space and medical offices were performing well, while big box and office spaces were encountering difficulties (Richmond Fed). A Cleveland contact reported that demand for hotels (a consumer-facing property type) was softening in the near term (Cleveland Fed).\n\n- **Construction and supply:** In the Minneapolis District, a lack of new construction across most sectors was said to provide stability for existing properties but limit overall CRE market growth (Minneapolis Fed).\n\n- **Leasing and transactions:** In the Philadelphia District\u2019s nonresidential markets, leasing activity and transaction volumes continued to record slight growth (Philadelphia Fed).\n\n- **Prices and rents:** In the Chicago District, commercial real estate prices and rents were reported as unchanged, though vacancy rates grew slightly (Chicago Fed). In the San Francisco District, changes in commercial real estate rents were mixed (San Francisco Fed). A South Carolina broker in the Richmond District indicated that properties \u201cwon\u2019t sell for yesterday\u2019s prices,\u201d signaling seller resistance to lower pricing relative to past levels (Richmond Fed).\n\n- **Vacancy:** The Atlanta District reported that office vacancy rates increased somewhat as new supply outpaced demand, and industrial vacancy rates increased slightly (Atlanta Fed). Chicago contacts reported that vacancy rates in the commercial real estate market grew slightly (Chicago Fed).\n\n- **Credit and lending:** In the Kansas City District, credit standards and access to credit for commercial real estate and construction were reportedly stable (Kansas City Fed; Kansas City Community and Regional Banking). In the Philadelphia District, commercial real estate loans declined modestly (Philadelphia Fed). In the New York District, small-to-medium-sized banks reported that demand for commercial mortgages held steady (New York Fed). In the Dallas District, loan performance for commercial real estate loans sharply improved in September, while overall credit standards (outside residential) continued tightening (Dallas Fed).\n\n- **Outlook and sentiment:** The Dallas District reported that the commercial real estate outlook remained cautious (Dallas Fed). In the Richmond District, a Virginia broker described commercial real estate conditions as \u201cmurky,\u201d and a South Carolina broker echoed concerns about CRE conditions (Richmond Fed).\n\nTaken together, the findings indicate that residential real estate was generally slow with moderated price growth and softer new construction, while commercial real estate was flat to mixed, with sector-specific strength (retail, medical office) and weakness (office, big box, some hospitality), modest leasing and transaction growth, largely stable but not rapidly rising rents and prices, and a cautious outlook.",

      "question": "How did lower interest rates affect business activity?",
      "expected": "Commercial construction and financial services contacts noted an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates. Some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates.",
      "answer": "Lower interest rates affected business activity mainly by boosting credit demand in specific areas but did not generate a broad surge in investment or hiring.\n\n1. **Increased lending and sector-specific demand (especially construction and financial services)**  \n   - Federal Reserve sources report that lower interest rates led to **improved business lending** in recent weeks and a **moderate increase in loan demand** from businesses (OverallEconomicActivity; Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Financial Services).  \n   - **Commercial construction** contacts repeatedly \u201creported an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates\u201d and explicitly **attributed** this increase in demand to lower rates (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Summary of Economic Activity; Cleveland, Body).  \n   - **Financial services** contacts similarly \u201cnoted an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates\u201d and attributed the increase in demand to lower rates (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Summary of Economic Activity; Cleveland, Body).  \n   - The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco reported that \u201crecent reductions in interest rates started to spur additional demand for loans\u201d during the reporting period (Financial Institutions).\n\n2. **Limited translation into broad-based investment and output growth**  \n   - Despite easier credit conditions, some reports indicated that **spending plans were soft**, showing **weaker intended expenditures by firms**, and that businesses **did not expect much of an increase in economic activity in the months ahead** (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Prices and Summary of Economic Activity).  \n   - The research synthesis for post-2008 and post-2020 low-rate periods concludes that, while low rates encouraged lending and sectoral demand, they **\u201chave not consistently translated into broad-based increases in business investment or significant hiring growth,\u201d** with this effect described as **mixed and often constrained by other factors** (Synthesis in Finding 2, based on multiple Fed reports).\n\n3. **Cautious hiring and largely steady employment**  \n   - In the New York District, **employment held steady**, with firms having **less need to hire for replacement**, implying **reduced replacement hiring and turnover** (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Labor Markets).  \n   - The Boston Fed reported that **overall employment was flat**, with both hiring and layoffs only increasing modestly (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Labor Markets).  \n   - The Dallas Fed noted that firms **remained cautious with hiring** (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Labor Markets).  \n   - Across several Districts, many firms reported **no change in full-time employment**, and in at least one case, the share of firms reporting no change was higher than the historical average (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Labor Markets).  \n   - One banker specifically reported hiring **loan originators** in anticipation of lower mortgage rates increasing mortgage demand, indicating some **targeted hiring linked to rate-sensitive lending** (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Labor Markets).\n\n4. **Headwinds: uncertainty, strained finances, and \u201csideline mentality\u201d**  \n   - The Kansas City Fed described **heightened uncertainty as a headwind for investment** (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Energy).  \n   - The San Francisco Fed reported that **small business owners reduced their investment** amid **weaker conditions and strained finances** and **drew down their savings** to cope with weaker demand (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Community Conditions).  \n   - A Richmond Fed contact noted that many borrowers were **awaiting more certainty** in interest rates and in the overall economy before borrowing, contributing to a **\u201csideline mentality\u201d** (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Banking and Finance).  \n   - In some areas, borrowers were **paying down lines of credit** and trying to keep more cash on hand, rather than expanding borrowing despite lower rates (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Credit Conditions).\n\n5. **Distributional and sectoral differences, especially for small businesses and housing**  \n   - While overall business lending improved, **access to credit remained limited for smaller borrowers**, as reported by the St. Louis Fed (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Banking and Finance).  \n   - Small-to-medium sized banks in the New York District reported that **demand for business loans sagged** and that overall loan demand declined because of weaker business loan demand, even as commercial mortgage demand held steady (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Banking and Finance).  \n   - The San Francisco Fed noted that **small business owners** specifically **reduced investment** and relied on savings due to **strained finances and weaker demand**, indicating that low rates did not fully offset these pressures for smaller firms (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Community Conditions).  \n   - In housing, responses to lower mortgage rates were **mixed**:  \n     - The Dallas Fed reported that housing market activity **remained weak despite a recent dip in mortgage rates** (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Construction and Real Estate).  \n     - In the St. Louis District, **lower-priced homes** were \u201cselling quickly unless they needed repairs,\u201d but other segments were slower (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Real Estate and Construction).\n\n**Overall synthesized answer based on the findings:**  \nLower interest rates primarily affected business activity by **reducing borrowing costs and increasing loan demand**, especially in **commercial construction and financial services**, where contacts explicitly tied higher demand and upticks in activity to lower rates. However, **broader business investment, hiring, and output responded only modestly**, constrained by **heightened uncertainty, strained finances (especially for small businesses), limited credit access for smaller borrowers, and a widespread \u201csideline mentality.\u201d** As a result, the observed effect was **sectorally concentrated and mixed**, rather than a uniform, strong expansion in overall business activity.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",

In Chicago, crops were in good shape across most of the District, though soybean prices were lower due to absence of new-crop exports to China. In Atlanta, overall demand for agricultural products was healthy. Minneapolis agricultural contacts were concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases.",
      "answer": "Conditions in the agriculture sector were generally strained and uneven across regions and subsectors, with notable stress in crop production and comparatively better conditions for cattle producers.\n\n- **Farm income, working capital, and credit conditions (Kansas City, St. Louis, Minneapolis):**  \n  - In the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\u2019s area, more than 80% of lenders in crop\u2011heavy regions reported declines in both farm income and working capital, versus about 40% of lenders in more cattle\u2011producing areas (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City).  \n  - The Kansas City Fed also reported that agricultural credit conditions deteriorated and farmer sentiment was weak (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City).  \n  - The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis characterized agriculture conditions in its District as \u201cstrained\u201d and said they had \u201cfurther deteriorated\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Agriculture and Natural Resources; Summary of Economic Activity).  \n  - In the Minneapolis District, agricultural conditions weakened since the previous report, and producer incomes were weighed down by low crop prices and elevated expenses (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Summary of Economic Activity; Agriculture, Energy, and Natural Resources).\n\n- **Subsector differences \u2013 crops vs. cattle:**  \n  - Conditions were \u201cconsiderably stronger for cattle producers\u201d than for other parts of the sector in the Kansas City Fed\u2019s region (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City).  \n  - In crop\u2011focused areas, lenders widely reported declines in farm income and working capital (over 80% of lenders), while in more cattle\u2011oriented areas only about 40% reported such declines (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City).\n\n- **Prices, production, and yields:**  \n  - In the Minneapolis District, prices for several crops (soybeans, pulse crops, hay, wheat) were down from a year earlier, while prices for cattle, hogs, and turkeys were up (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Prices).  \n  - The Atlanta Fed noted that corn and soybeans \u201cremained depressed\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Energy).  \n  - In the Minneapolis District, soybean harvests were described as very strong and corn production in District states was expected to set new records compared with prior years (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Agriculture, Energy, and Natural Resources).  \n  - In the Dallas Fed\u2019s region, agricultural production and yields were generally strong, and many cotton growers expected their best harvest in three to four years; this strong cotton harvest was also seen as positive for downstream industries such as warehouses (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Agriculture).  \n\n- **Regional variation in overall conditions:**  \n  - The Chicago Fed reported that agriculture in its District was \u201cin good shape\u201d across most of the region (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Agriculture).  \n  - The Atlanta Fed reported that agriculture conditions in the Sixth District were \u201cmostly healthy,\u201d and overall demand for agricultural products was healthy, with strong domestic demand for beef, poultry, peanuts, and tobacco (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Summary of Economic Activity; Energy).  \n  - In contrast, the St. Louis District reported strained and deteriorating conditions, and contacts there indicated that government support would be a \u201ccritical lifeline\u201d for many farmers (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Agriculture and Natural Resources).\n\n- **Input costs and operational pressures:**  \n  - Nonlabor input costs, including chemical inputs, rose at a robust pace in the Cleveland District, continuing an upward trend (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Prices).  \n  - The Chicago Fed noted that nonlabor input costs rose moderately, and there were concerns about higher input costs looking ahead to 2026 (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Agriculture; Prices).  \n  - In the Minneapolis District, producer incomes were weighed down by elevated expenses (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Agriculture, Energy, and Natural Resources).  \n  - The San Francisco Fed reported that producers continued to experience financial strain due to commodity conditions and a recent heat wave, with that heat wave putting additional financial strain on producers (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Agriculture and Resource\u2011Related Industries).\n\n- **Labor and weather\u2011related challenges:**  \n  - In the San Francisco Fed\u2019s region, \u201clabor shortfalls reduced harvests,\u201d and several contacts reported difficulties finding enough labor (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Agriculture and Resource\u2011Related Industries).  \n  - In the St. Louis District, agricultural contacts reported labor shortages due to workers not reporting to work because of fears of deportation (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Labor Markets).  \n  - A recent heat wave in the San Francisco District further strained producers financially (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Agriculture and Resource\u2011Related Industries).\n\n- **Trade and demand conditions:**  \n  - In the Atlanta Fed\u2019s coverage, trade policy volatility weighed on agricultural exports, even as overall demand for agricultural products remained healthy (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Energy).  \n  - In the Chicago District, corn prices were down despite strong export volumes, and soybean prices were lower in part because of the absence of new\u2011crop soybean exports to China (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Agriculture).  \n  - In the Minneapolis District, agricultural contacts were concerned about China\u2019s elimination of purchases of soybeans (Minneapolis, Body).\n\n- **Loan demand and financial system context:**  \n  - In the St. Louis District, loan demand was moderate and had been increasing, and bankers expected the recent trend of increasing loan demand to continue (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Banking and Finance).  \n  - In the Dallas District, overall loan demand rose modestly, and survey respondents expected an acceleration in loan demand six months ahead (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Summary of Economic Activity; Financial Services).  \n  - In the Kansas City District, district banks reported that overall loan quality remained sound and noted little to no change in loan demand across categories (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Community and Regional Banking).  \n\nIn summary, across Federal Reserve Districts, agricultural conditions were mixed but often stressed: many crop producers faced declining income and working capital amid low crop prices and rising nonlabor input costs, while cattle producers generally saw stronger conditions. Some districts (Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, parts of Minneapolis) reported good production and mostly healthy or strong conditions, whereas the St. Louis District, and crop\u2011heavy parts of the Kansas City and Minneapolis Districts, reported strained and deteriorating financial conditions, with government support seen as critical for many farmers.",

The agent\u2019s answer includes all of these elements (mixed overall, St. Louis strained/deteriorated, Chicago good shape with soy price weakness tied to no new-crop exports to China, Atlanta healthy demand, Minneapolis China/soybean concern).

While this is retail, it reflects broader cost\u2011management and labor\u2011tightening behavior connected to supply and distribution chains.  \n  - A construction firm in Memphis (St. Louis District) reported that a *reduced labor pool* was *driving up labor costs* (St. Louis \u2013 Labor Markets), indicating labor\u2011cost pressure in at least some related sectors.\n\n**Overall state of transportation activity (as reflected in these districts)**\n\n- Freight transportation conditions show *general weakness* in trucking and overall rail carloads, with:\n  - persistent and accelerating declines in consumer\u2011goods truck shipments (Atlanta),\n  - continuing downward trends in over\u2011the\u2011road freight (Richmond),\n  - lower freight volumes in specific regions such as Alaska (San Francisco),\n  - flat freight demand in parts of the Cleveland District, and\n  - air cargo declines in the Cleveland District.\n\n- At the same time, there are *pockets of strength*:\n  - robust container volumes at ports (Atlanta, Dallas),\n  - rising intermodal rail volumes (Atlanta),\n  - and broad-based increases in airline passenger volumes (Dallas).\n\n- Travel-related passenger activity is *uneven*: airlines in Dallas report rising passenger volumes, but leisure and tourism demand has softened or turned mixed in the Atlanta, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts.\n\n- Cost and labor dynamics indicate *rising non-fuel costs* (e.g., trucking insurance in St. Louis), active efforts to *cut or manage transportation and labor costs* (St. Louis, Minneapolis), and *downward pressure on freight spot rates* due to low demand (Richmond).",

      "answer": "Across the cited sources, artificial intelligence affected employment decisions mainly by reducing demand for certain workers\u2014especially in entry-level and less experienced roles\u2014and by contributing to workforce reductions in some firms and sectors.\n\n1. **Reduced need for entry-level and less experienced workers**\n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco reported that, in some cases, \u201cemployment reductions were accompanied by investment in artificial intelligence, particularly for positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees,\u201d and that AI investment was \u201ctargeted to positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees.\u201d  \n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis described a Minnesota advertising firm that said \u201cthere would be a smaller need for entry-level workers because AI tools get the work done faster,\u201d and that \u201cAI tools get entry-level work done faster.\u201d\n\n   These examples indicate that AI adoption led firms to adjust hiring decisions by cutting or not backfilling entry-level roles that AI could perform more efficiently.\n\n2. **Layoffs and reduced overall labor needs in some firms**\n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City reported that \u201cthe adoption and implementation of AI capabilities reduced overall labor needs at some professional service companies,\u201d and that \u201clarger recent layoffs were associated with the adoption and implementation of AI capabilities that reduced overall labor needs.\u201d\n   * The San Francisco Fed likewise noted cases where \u201cemployment reductions were accompanied by investment in artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\n   In these contexts, AI adoption directly influenced layoff decisions and overall headcount, as firms used AI capabilities to justify or enable reductions in staff.\n\n3. **Expectations of dampened future labor demand**\n   * The Minneapolis Fed reported that \u201cartificial intelligence was expected to have a slight dampening effect on future labor demand.\u201d\n\n   This indicates that AI was shaping forward-looking employment decisions, with employers anticipating slower hiring or lower staffing needs because of AI.\n\n4. **Shift in demand toward AI-related and IT roles**\n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston reported that First District contacts \u201ccited AI adoption as a factor driving spillover IT investments that supported strong demand for software and IT services,\u201d and that strong demand for these services was partly due to \u201cspillover IT investments related to AI adoption.\u201d\n\n   While some employers reduced hiring or cut jobs in positions affected by AI, others increased hiring in technical and IT roles needed to support AI systems, thereby influencing which types of workers were hired.\n\n5. **Emphasis on retaining more experienced employees**\n   * The San Francisco Fed noted that \u201csome contacts highlighted efforts by employers to prioritize the retention of experienced employees.\u201d\n\n   In the same reports where AI investment was linked to reductions in less experienced positions, employers\u2019 stated efforts to retain experienced staff indicate that AI adoption influenced which employees were kept versus reduced.\n\n6. **What the findings do *not* specify**\n   * The provided evidence does not detail how AI affected specific stages of hiring (such as resume screening or interview analysis), promotion criteria, or performance evaluations.\n   * The findings do not provide direct evidence on algorithmic bias or discrimination in AI-driven employment decisions; any such effects are not specified in the cited material.\n   * Aside from the general dampening of labor demand and sectoral shifts (toward IT/AI roles), broader labor-market-wide job creation versus displacement effects are not quantified in the snippets provided.\n\nIn sum, according to the cited Federal Reserve sources, AI affected employment decisions by enabling firms to reduce headcount and new hiring\u2014especially in entry-level and less experienced roles\u2014while at the same time supporting increased demand for specialized technical and IT workers, and prompting employers to prioritize retention of more experienced employees.",
      "verdict": "correct",

Overall employment levels were largely stable, but demand for labor was generally muted, with more employers reporting layoffs and attrition.",
      "answer": "Across recent Beige Book reports, AI-related investment and adoption are linked to employment in two main ways, with clear district-level examples:\n\n1. **AI investment associated with reduced labor needs and fewer entry-level jobs**\n\n   - In the San Francisco District, \u201cemployment reductions were accompanied by investment in artificial intelligence, particularly for positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees,\u201d and \u201cinvestment in artificial intelligence was targeted to positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Labor Markets).  \n   - In the Kansas City District, \u201csome professional service companies indicated that larger recent layoffs were associated with the adoption and implementation of AI capabilities that reduced overall labor needs,\u201d and more generally \u201cthe adoption and implementation of AI capabilities reduced overall labor needs at some professional service companies\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Labor Markets).  \n   - In the Minneapolis District, \u201ca Minnesota advertising firm said there would be a smaller need for entry-level workers because AI tools get the work done faster,\u201d and AI \u201cwas expected to have a slight dampening effect on future labor demand\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Labor Markets).\n\n   Together, these reports indicate a relationship where AI investment/adoption is explicitly connected to:\n   * layoffs or employment reductions,\n   * reduced overall labor needs,\n   * and specifically a smaller need for less-experienced or entry-level workers.\n\n2. **AI adoption supporting demand for specialized IT and AI-related work**\n\n   - In the Boston District, \u201cFirst District contacts cited AI adoption as a factor driving spillover IT investments that supported strong demand for software and IT services,\u201d and they \u201cattributed the strong demand for software and IT services to the increasingly essential nature of the services provided and to spillover IT investments related to AI adoption\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Software and IT Services).

While there are optimistic subsectors (e.g., infrastructure in Minneapolis, energy and financial services in Dallas, manufacturing in New York), these do not translate into a broadly strong district\u2011wide outlook.\n\n- **Labor markets and hiring expectations:**  \n  - In **growth districts**, hiring is present but cautious:  \n    - Boston: hiring plans limited in the near term; longer\u2011term hiring outlook less secure.  \n    - Cleveland: contacts are hiring to fill open positions and, in some cases, for current or anticipated growth.  \n  - In **decline districts**, labor dynamics are softer:  \n    - Kansas City: employment levels fell slightly; banks foresee challenges in consumer lending as incomes decline.  \n    - Minneapolis: labor demand has softened, and hiring is primarily to replace vacancies.  \n    - Dallas: employment fell and some services activity contracted, even as some sectors look ahead more optimistically.\n\n- **Sectoral pattern of outlook:**  \n  - **Growth districts** see modest broad\u2011based improvement with sectoral nuances (e.g., Boston\u2019s consumer spending and modest commercial real estate gains; Philadelphia\u2019s manufacturing strength).  \n  - **Decline districts** show **mixed or deteriorating outlooks at the aggregate level**, with **optimism concentrated in specific sectors** (manufacturing in New York; infrastructure and certain goods\u2011producing sectors in Minneapolis; energy and some services in Dallas) rather than in overall district conditions.\n\nIn sum, based on the Beige Book findings cited, districts that recently **experienced modest growth** (Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland) generally **anticipate modest further gains in activity** with cautious hiring and sector\u2011specific risks, whereas districts that **experienced recent softening or decline** (New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, San Francisco) tend to report a **weaker or worsening near\u2011term outlook**, with notable concern about inflation, softening labor demand, and constrained spending or lending, offset only partially by isolated sectoral optimism.",

      "question": "How did trade-related concerns affect the agriculture sector across different districts?",
      "expected": "In the Minneapolis District, agricultural contacts were specifically concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases, representing a direct trade policy impact. In the St. Louis District, agriculture conditions were strained and further deteriorated, with the overall pessimistic outlook. Across reporting districts, activity in agriculture was generally down, with trade uncertainty adding to sector challenges.",
      "answer": "Trade-related concerns\u2014mainly tariffs, trade policy volatility, and the loss of key export markets\u2014affected agriculture across Federal Reserve Districts through three main channels: export demand (especially soybeans to China), commodity prices and farm income, and input/operating costs. The specific effects varied by district.\n\n**Chicago District (Seventh)**  \n- Soybean prices in the District were lower, in part because new-crop soybean exports to China were absent. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)  \n- Corn prices were down despite strong export volumes. (Chicago)  \n- Even with these price pressures, agriculture in the District was reported to be in good shape across most of the District. (Chicago)\n\n**Minneapolis District (Ninth)**  \n- Agricultural contacts were concerned about China\u2019s elimination of purchases of soybeans. (Minneapolis)  \n- Commodity prices for soybeans decreased from a year earlier in the District, which weighed on producer incomes. (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis)  \n- Producer incomes were further weighed down by elevated expenses. (Minneapolis)  \n- This occurred despite very strong soybean harvests and corn production expected to set new records. (Minneapolis)\n\n**Kansas City District (Tenth)**  \n- In a recent survey, over 80% of lenders in crop\u2011heavy areas reported declines in both farm income and working capital, versus about 40% in cattle\u2011heavy areas. (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City)  \n- Agricultural credit conditions deteriorated, and farmer sentiment was weak. (Kansas City)  \n- Conditions were considerably stronger for cattle producers than for crop producers. (Kansas City)  \n- Heightened uncertainty\u2014linked in the findings to trade policy volatility\u2014was described as a headwind for investment. (Kansas City)\n\n**St. Louis District (Eighth)**  \n- Agriculture conditions were described as \u201cstrained\u201d and having \u201cfurther deteriorated.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)  \n- Weak agriculture conditions in rural areas were reported to be negatively impacting the housing market. (St. Louis)  \n- Separate from trade, contacts in agriculture also reported labor shortages due to workers not reporting to work because of fears of deportation. (St. Louis) The findings do not link these labor shortages directly to trade policy.\n\n**Atlanta District (Sixth)**  \n- Trade policy volatility weighed on agricultural exports. (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta)  \n- Overall demand for agricultural products was described as healthy, with strong domestic demand for beef, poultry, peanuts, and tobacco. (Atlanta)  \n- Agriculture conditions in the Sixth District were \u201cmostly healthy\u201d over the period described. (Atlanta)\n\n**Richmond District (Fifth)**  \n- Firms reported that tariffs were adding to their input costs and continued to cite tariffs as adding to input costs in both goods and services sectors. (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond)  \n- Some tariff-driven input cost increases had not yet been passed along to customers. (Richmond)  \n- The findings do not separately quantify agricultural income or prices in this district.\n\n**Cleveland District (Fourth)**  \n- Retail contacts noted that tariffs had driven cost increases on beef and coffee. (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland)  \n- Two contacts reported that foreign producers were cutting prices to retain market share and factoring in tariffs when setting their prices. (Cleveland)  \n- A commercial banker reported that loan demand increased as clients gained clarity around tariff impacts. (Cleveland)  \n- These effects reflect trade-related cost and pricing pressures; the findings do not isolate direct measures of farm income in agriculture.\n\n**Philadelphia, New York, Boston Districts (Third, Second, First)**  \n- Firms reported cost pressures from tariffs and expected further tariff impacts in the months ahead. (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia; Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Federal Reserve Bank of Boston)  \n- Tariffs were cited as a headwind for manufacturing and related services. (Boston)  \n- The findings do not provide district\u2011specific quantitative measures for agricultural income or production in these districts, only that tariffs were broadly affecting costs.\n\n**Dallas District (Eleventh)**  \n- Many cotton growers expected their best cotton harvest in three to four years, and a strong cotton harvest was a positive development for downstream industries such as transportation and warehouses. (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)  \n- Despite this, cotton prices remained \u201csub\u2011profitable,\u201d indicating prices were too low to be considered profitable. (Dallas)  \n- Tariffs appeared to be one of the primary drivers of uncertainty among contacts (reported in retail/manufacturing), but the findings do not explicitly tie this uncertainty to specific agriculture investment decisions in Dallas. (Dallas)\n\n**San Francisco District (Twelfth)**  \n- Producers in agriculture and resource\u2011related industries continued to experience financial strain due to conditions in commodities and a recent heat wave. (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco)  \n- Labor shortfalls reduced harvests. (San Francisco)  \n- The findings do not explicitly attribute these strains to trade policy, only to commodity conditions and weather.\n\n**Cross\u2011district patterns**  \n- **Soybean exports to China:** The absence or elimination of Chinese purchases of new\u2011crop soybeans was a specific concern in Chicago and Minneapolis, contributing to lower soybean prices and weighing on producer incomes there. (Chicago, Minneapolis)  \n- **Farm income and credit:** Trade\u2011related price weakness in crop markets coincided with broad reports of declining farm income and weaker working capital in crop\u2011heavy regions of the Kansas City District, contributing to deteriorating agricultural credit conditions. (Kansas City)  \n- **Exports and uncertainty:** Trade policy volatility weighed on agricultural exports in the Atlanta District and was cited as a headwind for investment (Kansas City) and a primary driver of uncertainty among contacts (Dallas). (Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas)  \n- **Input costs:** Tariffs raised input and operating costs in multiple districts\u2014Richmond (tariffs adding to firms\u2019 input costs), Cleveland (tariff\u2011driven cost increases on beef and coffee), and Philadelphia/New York/Boston (tariff\u2011related cost pressures). (Richmond, Cleveland, Philadelphia, New York, Boston)  \n- **Overall conditions:** While Midwestern and Plains districts with heavy crop production (Minneapolis, Kansas City, St. Louis) reported strained or deteriorating agricultural conditions linked to low crop prices and export disruptions, some southern and coastal districts (Atlanta, parts of Dallas and Chicago) reported mostly healthy agricultural conditions, supported by strong domestic demand or good harvests, even as trade concerns weighed on prices and added uncertainty. (Minneapolis, Kansas City, St. Louis, Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago)\n\nWhere the findings are silent\u2014for example, on precise magnitudes of export losses, detailed employment effects in agriculture, or explicit causal quantification\u2014the answer cannot specify more than the qualitative linkages described above.",

others delayed or only partially adjusted prices, and \u201csome tariff\u2011driven increases in input costs had not yet been passed along to customers\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond).  \n- \u201cSmaller manufacturers passed through a larger share of tariff\u2011induced cost increases to customers over the period discussed\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston), and \u201cseveral manufacturers recently increased their prices in response to tariffs\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis).  \n- Contacts in several districts \u201cwarned that price passthrough resulting from tariffs had just begun\u201d and \u201cexpected that prices would continue to rise\u2026due to ongoing tariff\u2011related passthrough\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta).\n\n### Manufacturing and steel\u2011using industries\n- District reports note that \u201ctariffs contributed to sharper selling price increases in the manufacturing sector\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas) and that \u201cfirms in manufacturing fully passed higher import costs along to their customers in some cases\u201d (summary \u201cPrices > Body\u201d).  \n- Manufacturing contacts \u201cattributed the increases in metals prices to tariffs\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago), and \u201cfirms cited tariffs as a factor associated with the pickup in price growth in manufacturing\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond).  \n- However, the Richmond Fed also reported that \u201csome tariff\u2011driven input cost increases had not yet been passed along to customers,\u201d indicating partial or delayed pass\u2011through within manufacturing.\n\n### Auto sector\n- In autos, the dominant response was **absorption** of costs rather than price hikes: \u201cSome auto manufacturers stated that they were absorbing tariff\u2011related increases in order to prevent further declines in demand\u201d and \u201creported that they were absorbing tariff\u2011related increases rather than passing them on\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta).  \n- Auto contacts \u201creported feeling the pinch from tariffs on new car sales\u201d and indicated that tariffs were affecting new car sales (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta), reinforcing that price increases were constrained by demand concerns.\n\n### Retail, consumer goods, and apparel\n- In retail trades, in some cases \u201cfirms in retail trades fully passed higher import costs along to their customers\u201d (summary \u201cPrices > Body\u201d).  \n- The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco reports that \u201cretailers passed a sizable portion of the upstream cost and price increases on to consumers, mostly in the mid to high\u2011end markets,\u201d indicating stronger pass\u2011through where customers were less price\u2011sensitive.  \n- At the same time, a Chicago District retail analyst noted that \u201cin general, retailers were trying to hold off passing tariff\u2011related cost increases on to consumers for as long as possible,\u201d and \u201cseveral smaller retailers reported that they had already raised prices because of tariffs\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago).  \n- A major retailer \u201cadjusted price increases based on the demand elasticity of each item in the context of tariff\u2011related pricing strategies\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of New York), showing item\u2011by\u2011item, elasticity\u2011based pricing responses.  \n- Consumer\u2011facing businesses \u201cacross sectors reported an inability to pass through all higher costs to consumers in their prices for goods and services\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia), highlighting incomplete pass\u2011through in many retail and service settings.  \n- In apparel and broader retail categories, the general evidence above applies: some firms fully passed on costs, others only partially; smaller retailers were more likely to have already raised prices, while larger ones often delayed.\n\n### Services\n- Some service\u2011oriented firms reported significant pricing power: \u201cA few service\u2011oriented firms noted that they were able to increase prices without pushback from customers,\u201d and some indicated that \u201cmaintaining or increasing prices helped preserve strong margins\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta).  \n- Nonetheless, the Philadelphia Fed notes that consumer\u2011facing businesses broadly could not pass through all higher costs, implying heterogeneity within services as well.\n\n### Foreign producers and suppliers\n- On the supply side, some foreign producers changed prices rather than letting tariffs fully raise downstream prices:  \n  - \u201cTwo contacts reported that foreign producers were factoring in tariffs when setting their prices\u201d and that \u201cforeign producers were cutting prices to retain market share in the face of tariffs\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland).  \n  - Some suppliers \u201craised prices while citing tariffs as justification, even if their goods were not subject to increased levies\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia).  \n  - The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco indicates that \u201cmany suppliers absorbed some of the price increases resulting from higher import duties,\u201d which limited immediate pass\u2011through to buyers in some cases.\n\n### Cross\u2011sector mitigation strategies beyond pricing\n- Across sectors, many firms worked to offset tariff costs via sourcing changes rather than (or before) pricing changes: \u201cMany businesses reported working with vendors to find alternative inputs to mitigate the impact of tariffs on their costs\u201d and \u201csought alternative inputs from vendors\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis).  \n- These sourcing and cost\u2011management efforts often complemented partial or delayed price increases.\n\n**In summary (by sector):**  \n- **Manufacturing/steel\u2011using:** Often increased selling prices; in some cases fully passed through higher import costs, though some firms delayed or partially passed through. Smaller manufacturers passed through more.  \n- **Autos:** More likely to **absorb** tariff\u2011related cost increases to protect demand, limiting direct pass\u2011through to vehicle prices.  \n- **Retail/consumer goods/apparel:** Mixed strategies; some full or sizable pass\u2011through (especially mid\u2013high\u2011end segments), smaller retailers raising prices earlier, but many large retailers delayed or calibrated increases based on demand elasticity.  \n- **Services:** Some service firms successfully raised prices without customer pushback, though many consumer\u2011facing firms could not fully pass through costs.  \n- **Suppliers/foreign producers:** Sometimes absorbed tariffs or cut prices, sometimes raised prices (in some cases using tariffs as a justification), influencing how much downstream firms needed to adjust their own prices.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is specific: (1) in manufacturing and retail trades, some firms fully passed tariff-related cost increases to customers; (2) other firms kept prices largely unchanged to preserve market share due to pushback from price-sensitive clients; and (3) a Chicago retail analyst expected peak tariff impact in the first half of 2026. \n\nThe agent answer captures the general sectoral heterogeneity and includes that some manufacturing and retail firms passed through costs while others delayed/partially absorbed due to demand sensitivity\u2014so it matches points (1) and (2) in broad terms.\n\nHowever, it adds extensive, largely unrelated detail (2018\u20132019 Fed Beige Book-style discussion) and does not include the key Chicago-specific timing claim about peak impact in the first half of 2026. That missing expected detail makes the response only partially correct.",

      "question": "What was the relationship between federal policy and electric vehicle sales, and how did this affect overall auto sales?",
      "expected": "Auto sales were boosted in some districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September. However, in the Chicago District, light vehicle sales declined overall, especially for EVs following the end of federal tax credits. This shows the federal tax credit created a pre-expiration demand surge followed by a post-expiration decline.",
      "answer": "Federal policy affected electric vehicle (EV) sales mainly through federal purchase incentives and tax credits, and this in turn temporarily boosted overall auto sales by pulling demand forward.\n\n1. **Relationship between federal policy and EV sales**\n\n   - Multiple Federal Reserve reports note that EV demand surged specifically in response to the scheduled expiration of a federal EV tax credit:\n     - \u201cStrong demand for electric vehicles occurred ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September, effectively pulling demand forward.\u201d (OverallEconomicActivity)\n     - Dealers saw a \u201crobust surge in new electric vehicle sales\u201d ahead of the expiration of the EV tax credit. (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, ConsumerSpending)\n     - One retailer reported that consumers bought EVs \u201cbefore the expiration of a federal EV tax credit at the end of September.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, TradeandServices)\n     - The \u201cpending expiration of [the] federal EV tax credit\u2026 incentivized purchases of electric vehicles before that deadline.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, TradeandServices)\n   - The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago similarly reported that \u201cbrisk new light vehicle sales reflected, in part, the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases\u201d and that \u201ctax incentives for electric vehicle purchases applied to electric vehicle purchases before they ended.\u201d (Chicago, Consumer Spending)\n\n   Together, these sources show that the federal EV tax credit, and especially its impending expiration, directly stimulated EV purchases by causing consumers to advance their purchase timing.\n\n2. **Effect on overall auto sales**\n\n   - The same reports indicate that this policy\u2011driven surge in EV sales raised overall auto sales in the short term:\n     - \u201cAuto sales were boosted in some Districts by strong demand for electric vehicles.\u201d (OverallEconomicActivity)\n     - The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago notes that \u201cbrisk new light vehicle sales reflected, in part, the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases,\u201d linking higher overall new light vehicle sales to the termination of EV incentives. (Chicago, Consumer Spending)\n     - In New Hampshire, \u201cthe rush to purchase electric vehicles before the expiration of tax credits drove the modest increase in auto sales.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, RetailandTourism)\n     - New light vehicle sales were broadly described as \u201cbrisk,\u201d while \u201cused vehicle sales remained steady overall,\u201d indicating that the uptick was concentrated in new vehicle sales associated partly with EV incentives. (Chicago, Consumer Spending)\n\n   - Regarding whether EV growth expanded the total market or displaced internal combustion engine (ICE) sales, the findings state:\n     - The observed pattern is that growth in EV sales \u201chas primarily been driven by consumers pulling forward purchases due to the expiration of federal tax credits.\u201d This surge \u201cboosted overall new light vehicle sales,\u201d but \u201cthere is no direct evidence presented to indicate that EV growth has significantly expanded the total auto market or is cannibalizing Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) sales.\u201d Used vehicle sales are reported as steady. (Synthesis based on Chicago, Atlanta, Boston, OverallEconomicActivity evidence)\n\nIn sum, the findings show a clear, documented link between federal EV tax credits and higher EV sales, with the impending expiration of those credits causing a notable, time\u2011concentrated spike in EV purchases. This spike, in turn, raised overall new auto sales in some Federal Reserve Districts by pulling demand forward, but the available evidence does not specify whether, beyond this timing effect, EV growth has expanded the total auto market or reduced ICE sales.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly states that impending expiration of a federal EV tax credit pulled demand forward, boosting EV sales and thereby boosting overall auto sales in some districts. However, it misses (and in places conflicts with) a key expected point: that after the tax credit ended, EV sales (and overall light vehicle sales) declined in the Chicago District, showing a post-expiration drop following the surge. The agent emphasizes brisk Chicago sales tied to incentive ending but does not describe the subsequent decline, so it is incomplete.",

      "question": "What were the multiple factors affecting labor costs, and how did they interact with wage growth?",
      "expected": "Wages grew at a modest to moderate pace across all districts. However, labor cost pressures intensified due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses. Additionally, some contacts in the Chicago District reported moderate increases in nonlabor costs including energy and higher prices for raw materials. This meant total compensation costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.",
      "answer": "Multiple factors affected labor costs, and they interacted with wage growth in the following ways, based on the cited sources:\n\n1. **Nonlabor input costs (energy, raw materials, imported components)**  \n   - Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and Chicago report \u201crobust\u201d and \u201cmoderate\u201d increases in nonlabor input costs, including energy and materials like aluminum, copper, steel, and chemical inputs, as well as imported components (Cleveland, Chicago \u2013 Prices).  \n   - These rising nonlabor costs contributed to overall cost pressures on firms, but the findings do not indicate that they produced an unusual acceleration in wage growth. Wage growth remained modest and near pre\u2011pandemic rates (Philadelphia, San Francisco \u2013 Labor Markets; Philadelphia \u2013 Summary of Economic Activity).\n\n2. **Employer-sponsored health insurance and benefits costs**  \n   - Labor cost pressures \u201cintensified in recent weeks due to outsized increases in employer\u2011sponsored health insurance expenses\u201d (LaborMarkets \u2013 Body).  \n   - At the same time, \u201cwages and benefits costs were up modestly overall\u201d (Chicago \u2013 Labor Markets).  \n   - This indicates that a notable portion of rising labor costs came from benefit expenses rather than faster wage growth, which multiple Federal Reserve districts characterize as modest and in line with long\u2011run averages (Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Francisco, Dallas \u2013 Labor Markets).\n\n3. **Sector- and occupation-specific wage pressures and labor availability**  \n   - Several districts report \u201cpersistent\u201d wage pressures in specific areas:\n     - Lower\u2011wage jobs in construction and manufacturing (San Francisco \u2013 Labor Markets).  \n     - Highly specialized positions, including AI\u2011related roles (San Francisco \u2013 Labor Markets).  \n     - A construction firm in Memphis noted that a \u201creduced labor pool was driving up labor costs\u201d (St. Louis \u2013 Labor Markets).  \n   - These findings show localized interactions: in sectors or occupations with tight labor supply, labor costs rose through higher wages, even though aggregate wage growth remained modest. In other words, labor cost increases in these niches were more wage\u2011driven than in the broader economy.\n\n4. **Profitability and firms\u2019 ability or willingness to raise wages**  \n   - Some manufacturers \u201cheld wages steady because of lack of profitability\u201d (Cleveland \u2013 Labor Markets).  \n   - This constrained wage growth despite other cost pressures, limiting the extent to which overall labor costs translated into higher wages.\n\n5. **Overall pattern of wage growth relative to labor cost pressures**  \n   - Across districts, wage growth is consistently described as:\n     - \u201cSlight\u201d or \u201cmodest\u201d (San Francisco, Dallas \u2013 Labor Markets; Atlanta \u2013 Labor Markets; Minneapolis \u2013 LaborMarkets).  \n     - In the \u201cone\u2011to\u2011three percent range\u201d (Atlanta \u2013 Labor Markets).  \n     - \u201cNear its modest pre\u2011pandemic rate,\u201d with increases \u201ctypical of their long\u2011run average\u201d (Philadelphia \u2013 Summary of Economic Activity; Philadelphia \u2013 Labor Markets; Philadelphia \u2013 Body).  \n     - With wage inflation \u201ceasing\u201d or \u201csoftening\u201d in many sectors (Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, San Francisco \u2013 Labor Markets).  \n   - Some contacts expect wage growth to slow further (Dallas \u2013 Labor Markets), though in at least one region firms anticipate some acceleration (New York \u2013 Labor Markets).  \n   - Taken together, this indicates that while several nonwage components (nonlabor inputs, health insurance) raised overall labor costs, the interaction with wage growth was muted at the aggregate level: wages rose modestly and often more slowly than these other cost components, so rising labor costs did not primarily stem from unusually rapid wage gains.\n\nIn summary, according to the cited reports, labor costs were pushed up by higher nonlabor input prices and sharply rising employer health insurance expenses, combined with targeted wage pressures in sectors facing labor shortages. However, overall wage growth stayed modest and near pre\u2011pandemic norms, meaning that these cost pressures increased total labor costs more than they accelerated broad-based wage growth.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer emphasizes: (1) wages rose modestly to moderately across districts; (2) labor cost pressures intensified mainly because of outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance; (3) some Chicago contacts reported moderate increases in nonlabor costs (energy/raw materials); (4) as a result, total compensation rose faster than wages alone.\n\nThe agent correctly includes the key point about outsized employer health insurance/benefit costs driving labor-cost pressure and notes that wages remained modest, implying total labor costs rose more than wage growth. It also mentions nonlabor input costs like energy and raw materials, including Chicago.\n\nHowever, the agent adds several extra factors (occupation-specific wage pressures, profitability constraints, imported components, multiple district details) that are not part of the expected core answer and somewhat diffuse the focus. It also does not clearly state the \"modest to moderate\" wage growth across all districts as in the expected answer (it mainly says modest).

In Chicago, financial conditions loosened modestly with business loan volumes increasing. However, the impact was mixed - while some reports noted improved business lending, residential real estate remained weak in Dallas and home sales were flat in Boston. The housing market's response to lower rates was more muted than commercial sectors.",
      "answer": "Lower interest rates primarily boosted demand in financial services and commercial construction, with more mixed or limited effects in housing and other sectors, and some notable regional differences.\n\n**1. Financial services and overall lending (multiple districts)**  \n- In the Cleveland District, financial services contacts explicitly linked stronger demand to lower rates: \u201clower interest rates were cited\u2026as the reason for higher demand in\u2026financial services,\u201d and bankers reported that lower rates \u201cencouraged households\u201d and \u201cencouraged businesses\u2026coinciding with a moderate increase in loan demand.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland)  \n- At the national level, \u201csome reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates,\u201d and in the San Francisco District \u201crecent reductions in interest rates started to spur additional demand for loans.\u201d (Overall Economic Activity; Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco)  \n- In the Chicago District, \u201cbusiness loan rates moved down\u201d and \u201cloan rates edged down in late August and September\u201d for consumers. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)  \n- Despite these rate declines, in the Philadelphia District \u201ca continued strong decline in commercial and industrial lending largely drove the moderate overall decline in bank lending.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia)  \n- In the Richmond District, a banker reported many borrowers were waiting for more certainty in rates before borrowing, contributing to a \u201csideline mentality.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond)\n\n**2. Commercial construction and real estate (Cleveland vs. other districts)**  \n- Cleveland stands out: contacts in commercial construction reported \u201can uptick in demand because of lower interest rates,\u201d and commercial construction contacts \u201cattributed the uptick in demand to lower interest rates.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland)  \n- By contrast, in the Kansas City District \u201cseveral aspects of new property development\u2026fell, including sales of construction materials, volume of construction underway, and prices for construction materials,\u201d despite no indication that lower rates offset this weakness. (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City)  \n- In the New York District, \u201cwith some easing in mortgage rates, contacts anticipated some reduction in rental demand in the coming months.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of New York)  \n\n**3. Residential housing and construction (mixed across districts)**  \n- Cleveland: lower mortgage rates were expected to increase mortgage demand, and one banker was hiring loan originators \u201cin anticipation of lower mortgage rates increasing mortgage demand.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland)  \n- Dallas: builders used \u201cmortgage rate buydowns as an incentive to close housing deals,\u201d but \u201chousing market activity remained weak\u2026despite a recent dip in mortgage rates.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)  \n- Minneapolis: \u201cpermits for new residential projects were notably lower\u201d over the period, with no sign that lower rates reversed this decline. (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis)  \n- New York: as noted, easing mortgage rates were expected to shift some demand away from rentals. (Federal Reserve Bank of New York)  \n- Other districts reported flat or weaker residential real estate activity without clearly tying conditions to lower rates\u2014for example, unchanged residential real estate activity in St. Louis, a decline in residential real estate in Atlanta, and somewhat decreased residential real estate activity in San Francisco. (Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis, Atlanta, San Francisco)\n\n**4. Auto sales and consumer credit (varied effects)**  \n- Cleveland: lower interest rates encouraged households, \u201ccoinciding with a moderate increase in loan demand,\u201d which is consistent with stronger consumer borrowing in this interest\u2011sensitive area. (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland)  \n- Philadelphia: \u201cauto loans rose modestly\u201d and \u201cconsumer lending excluding auto lending and credit cards rose strongly\u201d over the period, though these trends are not explicitly attributed to lower rates in the findings. (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia)  \n- Chicago: new light vehicle sales were \u201cbrisk,\u201d but \u201csofter demand for used vehicle sales was reported at dealerships located in low\u2011to\u2011moderate income communities,\u201d suggesting that lower rates did not uniformly boost all auto segments. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)  \n- Chicago also noted that consumer loan rates \u201cedged down,\u201d while in Kansas City consumer lending was deteriorating and expected to face further challenges due to decreasing disposable incomes, despite any changes in interest rates. (Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City)\n\n**5. Business investment and spending (limited response in some districts)**  \n- Cleveland reported that lower rates increased business loan demand (\u201cencouraged businesses\u2026coinciding with a moderate increase in loan demand\u201d) and that anticipated rate cuts were expected to drive a sharp increase in loan demand over the remainder of the year. (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland)  \n- Nationally, \u201csome reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates,\u201d but in the Chicago District \u201cbusiness spending declined slightly\u201d even as business loan rates moved down, and in the San Francisco District small business owners \u201creduced their investment\u2026amid weaker conditions and strained finances.\u201d (Overall Economic Activity; Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, San Francisco)\n\n**Summary across districts and sectors**  \n- **Most clearly positive and rate\u2011responsive:**  \n  - Cleveland District\u2019s financial services and commercial construction sectors, where contacts explicitly attributed higher demand to lower interest rates.  \n  - Loan demand in parts of the San Francisco District and nationally where improved business lending was directly linked to lower rates.  \n\n- **Mixed or weak response despite lower rates:**  \n  - Residential housing and construction in Dallas, Minneapolis, Atlanta, San Francisco, and Kansas City, where activity remained weak or declined even with lower or easing rates.  \n  - Auto and consumer lending, where some districts (Philadelphia, Cleveland) saw stronger lending and others (Chicago used autos, Kansas City consumer lending) showed softness or deterioration.  \n  - Commercial and industrial lending in Philadelphia, which continued to fall despite the broader environment of lower rates, and business spending in Chicago and San Francisco, which did not strengthen in tandem with lower borrowing costs.\n\nThe findings therefore indicate that lower interest rates tended to boost interest\u2011sensitive sectors like financial services and commercial construction most clearly in the Cleveland District and in some loan categories elsewhere, while the effects on housing, autos, and business investment were uneven across other Federal Reserve Districts.",

      "question": "How did federal funding changes affect employment in specific sectors?",
      "expected": "Federal funding changes negatively impacted employment across multiple sectors: In Boston, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in education and health-care sectors. In Cleveland, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to federal grant uncertainty. In New York, nonprofits faced challenges from reduced federal benefit programs, with community health-care centers reporting financial strain. Manufacturing employment in Boston was mixed, with one firm shedding workers to offset tariff-related cost increases.",
      "answer": "Federal funding changes affected employment differently across sectors, with clear negative effects where grants were cut and more modest, often indirect gains where spending (especially on infrastructure) increased.\n\n1. **Education and healthcare (negative impact from funding cuts)**  \n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston reports that **cuts to federal grant funding directly contributed to layoffs in the health\u2011care sector** and **in the education sector** (Boston > LaborMarkets).  \n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of New York notes that firms in **education and healthcare experienced \u201cfairly significant declines in headcounts\u201d** during the relevant period (New York > Labor Markets).  \n   * In the broader nonprofit space, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland finds that **nonprofits were not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants**, and a growing share reported **decreased funding** (Cleveland > CommunityConditions). This ties reduced or uncertain federal support to hiring freezes and weaker employment in government\u2011dependent organizations.\n\n2. **Nonprofits and community organizations (negative impact from reduced federal support)**  \n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland reports that **nonprofits were holding positions vacant due to uncertainty around federal grants**, and many indicated **declining funding** (Cleveland > CommunityConditions).  \n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas notes that **nonprofits trimmed head counts** over the period (Dallas > Labor Markets).  \n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports that **many nonprofits faced challenges due to reductions in federal benefit programs** (New York > Community Perspectives).  \n   Together, these findings indicate that reductions or uncertainty in federal funding and benefit programs were associated with employment cuts or stagnation in nonprofits and community service organizations.\n\n3. **Construction and infrastructure\u2011related sectors (positive or cushioning impact from infrastructure spending)**  \n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco reports that **new commercial construction was \u201cbuoyed\u201d by public and private infrastructure projects such as roads and data centers, along with construction of health facilities** (San Francisco > Real Estate and Construction).  \n   * Another San Francisco report notes that **roads** are a key example of public infrastructure projects supporting new commercial construction (San Francisco > Real Estate and Construction).  \n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis states that **contacts in Minnesota reported strong infrastructure activity and a positive outlook for infrastructure\u2011related work** (Minneapolis > Construction and RealEstate).  \n   * In the Kansas City District, **construction of data centers absorbed certain skilled workers**, even as broader commercial and residential slowdowns created headwinds for construction employment (Kansas City > RealEstate and Construction).  \n\n   These findings imply that where federal (and related) infrastructure spending was strong\u2014roads, data centers, health facilities\u2014**construction employment was supported or increased**, even when overall commercial construction was otherwise subdued.\n\n4. **Government\u2011dependent industries more broadly (employment declines with cuts)**  \n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports **\u201cfairly significant declines in headcounts\u201d in education, healthcare, retail, construction, and transportation** (New York > Labor Markets).  \n   * The Boston Fed ties some of these declines specifically to **cuts in federal grant funding** in education and health care (Boston > LaborMarkets).  \n   * The Cleveland Fed notes across industries that **declining business activity led to layoffs and reduced labor demand** (Cleveland > Labor Markets), and in nonprofits this was explicitly linked to **reduced or uncertain federal grants** (Cleveland > CommunityConditions).  \n\n   These findings show that **sectors more reliant on federal grants and transfers (education, health care, nonprofits) were particularly vulnerable to employment losses when federal funding was cut or uncertain.**\n\n5. **Finance, insurance, business services, and IT services (relative resilience or modest gains)**  \n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports that firms in **wholesale, finance, business services, and personal services saw \u201cslight\u2011to\u2011modest upticks\u201d in headcounts** during the same reporting period when education and healthcare were cutting jobs (New York > Labor Markets).  \n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco notes that **employers in financial services and insurance continued to hire** (San Francisco > Labor Markets).  \n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston reports that **employment in IT services increased modestly**, with hiring in both **sales and technical positions** (Boston > LaborMarkets).  \n\n   The findings do not attribute these increases directly to particular federal programs, but they show that **these less grant\u2011dependent sectors either held steady or modestly expanded employment while more federally funded sectors were cutting staff.** This indicates that the negative employment effects of federal funding cuts were **concentrated in grant\u2011reliant sectors**, not broadly spread across all industries.\n\n6. **Overall pattern and causality from the provided evidence**  \n   * Direct causal links are clearest where the sources explicitly connect **federal grant cuts to layoffs**:\n     * \u201cCuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the health\u2011care sector\u201d and in the **education sector** (Boston > LaborMarkets).  \n   * Construction and infrastructure\u2011related employment is **positively associated** with **infrastructure and facility spending**, with multiple reports that infrastructure projects **\u201cbuoyed\u201d** commercial construction and supported work (San Francisco > Real Estate and Construction; Minneapolis > Construction and RealEstate; Kansas City > RealEstate and Construction).  \n   * Across the economy, **overall employment was often reported as flat or only slightly changed**, with firms adjusting headcounts based on demand (e.g., Boston > LaborMarkets; New York > Labor Markets; San Francisco > Labor Markets). This suggests that **federal funding changes produced sector\u2011specific employment effects rather than large, uniform shifts in total employment.**\n\nIn sum, based on the cited findings:\n\n- **Cuts in federal grants and benefits clearly reduced employment in education, healthcare, nonprofits, and community organizations.**  \n- **Infrastructure\u2011related federal spending supported or increased employment in construction and related trades.**  \n- **Finance, insurance, business services, and IT services showed modest employment growth that the evidence does not directly tie to federal funding changes, but these sectors were notably more resilient than grant\u2011dependent sectors during periods of federal funding cuts.**",

      "question": "What supply chain disruptions affected manufacturing, and how did they impact production?",
      "expected": "Supply chain challenges varied across districts. In San Francisco, manufacturers noted higher costs for utilities and imported semiconductor chips. In Chicago, manufacturing demand declined modestly with fabricated metals demand unchanged on balance as higher sales to some sectors were offset by lower sales to construction and automotive industries. Tariff-induced input cost increases affected manufacturing across many districts, with firms reporting difficulty planning due to changing tariff policies. Labor shortages due to immigration policy changes also constrained production in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture sectors.",
      "answer": "Supply chain disruptions affected manufacturing mainly through higher input costs, tariffs, logistics adjustments, and some labor constraints, and these factors together weighed on production volumes, capacity use, and demand. The evidence is as follows:\n\n1. **Input cost shocks and material-related disruptions**\n\n   - **Semiconductors and other imported components:**  \n     The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco reported that \u201ccosts for imported semiconductor chips used in manufacturing were higher in recent weeks,\u201d and that \u201cinput costs were higher in recent weeks, including for utilities and imported semiconductor chips.\u201d (FRB San Francisco \u2013 Manufacturing).  \n     The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland similarly noted that nonlabor input costs, including imported components and chemical inputs, \u201crose at a robust pace in recent weeks.\u201d (FRB Cleveland \u2013 Prices).  \n     Higher import duties also \u201cled to a widespread cost increase for imported supplies, including raw materials, electrical and electronic components, and food.\u201d (FRB San Francisco \u2013 Prices).\n\n   - **Impact on production and pricing:**  \n     Manufacturers responded by raising output prices: Cleveland reported that manufacturers \u201cintroduced price increases to cover elevated input costs.\u201d (FRB Cleveland \u2013 Prices). In some cases, \u201cfirms in manufacturing fully passed higher import costs along to their customers.\u201d (Prices \u2013 Body).  \n     These higher costs were a constraint on production planning; Boston noted that manufacturing contacts \u201cfaced challenges in making production plans\u201d amid strong demand and cost pressures. (FRB Boston \u2013 Manufacturing and Related Services).\n\n2. **Tariffs and policy-related supply chain disruptions**\n\n   - **Tariffs as a direct cost and planning headwind:**  \n     Multiple Districts cited tariffs as a headwind for manufacturing. Boston reported that \u201ctariffs were cited by contacts as a headwind for manufacturing and related services\u201d and that inflation and uncertainty were also headwinds. (FRB Boston \u2013 Manufacturing and Related Services).  \n     Philadelphia and Richmond similarly reported \u201ccost pressures from tariffs\u201d and that tariffs \u201cadded to input costs.\u201d (FRB Philadelphia \u2013 Summary of Economic Activity; FRB Richmond \u2013 Prices).  \n     Atlanta and Boston noted that smaller manufacturers experienced \u201ctariff-induced cost increases,\u201d and Atlanta reported that firms said tariffs affected their operating costs over a wide range. (FRB Atlanta \u2013 Prices; FRB Boston \u2013 Prices).\n\n   - **Impact on demand and output:**  \n     Cleveland reported that manufacturers \u201creported modest declines in demand for goods, which they attributed to tariffs.\u201d (FRB Cleveland \u2013 Summary of Economic Activity).  \n     Dallas and Philadelphia reported that inflation and domestic policy uncertainty (including tariffs) \u201ccontinued to weigh on manufacturing outlooks,\u201d and that uncertainty was \u201ca moderate or significant constraint on capacity utilization\u201d according to the Philadelphia manufacturing survey. (FRB Dallas \u2013 Manufacturing; FRB Philadelphia \u2013 Manufacturing).\n\n   - **Firm-level mitigation strategies affecting production structure:**  \n     Many businesses \u201cworked with vendors to find alternative inputs to mitigate the impact of tariffs on their costs.\u201d (FRB New York \u2013 Prices).  \n     Some contacts reported \u201cshipping unfinished goods to the U.S. for final assembly to manage tariffs, shipping, and labor dynamics,\u201d and firms \u201cbuilt multiple facilities across the region to offset shipping and logistics costs.\u201d (FRB St. Louis \u2013 Manufacturing).  \n     A few contacts reported \u201csome reshoring of steel production,\u201d and an apparel company \u201coffshored manufacturing to the Caribbean due to labor challenges.\u201d (FRB Chicago \u2013 Manufacturing; FRB St. Louis \u2013 Manufacturing). These actions indicate reconfiguration of production locations and supply chains in response to tariff and cost pressures.\n\n3. **Logistics and warehousing disruptions**\n\n   - **Pre\u2011tariff import surges and warehousing:**  \n     Freight contacts in the Cleveland District reported \u201chigher warehouse utilization because goods were warehoused during the pre-tariff import surge.\u201d (FRB Cleveland \u2013 Nonfinancial Services). This reflects a logistics disruption where firms altered normal flows and inventories to get ahead of tariff changes, resulting in elevated storage and handling needs.\n\n   - **Impact on cost and facility decisions:**  \n     St. Louis contacts reported building \u201cmultiple facilities across the region to offset shipping and logistics costs,\u201d and shipping unfinished goods to the U.S. for final assembly \u201cto manage tariffs, shipping, and labor dynamics.\u201d (FRB St. Louis \u2013 Manufacturing). These steps changed where and how production occurred, with cost and efficiency implications for manufacturing operations.\n\n4. **Labor-related disruptions**\n\n   - **Labor shortages linked to supply chain and production:**  \n     In the St. Louis District, manufacturing contacts reported \u201clabor shortages due to workers not reporting to work because of fears of deportation.\u201d (FRB St. Louis \u2013 Labor Markets).  \n     More broadly, manufacturing and construction contacts discussed worker availability constraints. (FRB Chicago \u2013 Labor Markets). These labor issues affected the ability of firms to fully utilize capacity, although the data do not quantify exact production losses.\n\n   - **Impact on plant staffing and employment:**  \n     Boston noted that some manufacturing firms added workers to meet demand while others kept or reduced headcounts, leaving manufacturing employment \u201cunchanged on balance.\u201d (FRB Boston \u2013 Labor Markets). The apparel firm that \u201coffshored manufacturing to the Caribbean due to labor challenges\u201d is a concrete example of production shifting offshore in response to labor constraints. (FRB St. Louis \u2013 Manufacturing).\n\n5. **Sector\u2011specific production impacts**\n\n   - **Automotive manufacturing:**  \n     The Chicago Fed reported that \u201cauto production was down modestly in late August and September\u201d and that there were \u201cweaknesses among suppliers in the auto industry,\u201d which contributed to weaker business loan quality. (FRB Chicago \u2013 Manufacturing; FRB Chicago \u2013 Banking and Finance).  \n     Fabricated metals producers saw \u201clower sales to the automotive industry,\u201d and machinery orders declined \u201cdriven by a decline in demand from the automotive industry.\u201d (FRB Chicago \u2013 Manufacturing).  \n     Some auto manufacturers \u201creported feeling the pinch from tariffs on new car sales\u201d and said they were \u201cabsorbing tariff-related increases in order to prevent further declines in demand.\u201d (FRB Atlanta \u2013 Prices). This indicates that both cost and demand-side responses, linked to tariffs and broader disruptions, reduced auto sector output and orders.\n\n   - **Electronics and electrical components:**  \n     San Francisco reported higher costs for imported semiconductor chips and that higher import duties increased costs for \u201celectrical and electronic components.\u201d (FRB San Francisco \u2013 Manufacturing; FRB San Francisco \u2013 Prices).  \n     These higher component costs raised production costs for electronics-related manufacturing, though the findings do not quantify specific output reductions.\n\n   - **Machinery and related equipment:**  \n     Chicago reported that \u201cmachinery orders decreased moderately in late August and September,\u201d driven by weaker demand from the automotive industry. (FRB Chicago \u2013 Manufacturing).  \n     Dallas noted that \u201coutput growth abated for machinery within durable goods manufacturing.\u201d (FRB Dallas \u2013 Manufacturing). These declines in orders and output were linked to sectoral spillovers from disruptions in downstream industries (notably autos).\n\n6. **Aggregate effects on manufacturing activity, capacity, and outlook**\n\n   - **Production volumes and demand:**  \n     Chicago reported that \u201cmanufacturing demand declined modestly in late August and September.\u201d (FRB Chicago \u2013 Manufacturing).  \n     San Francisco indicated that \u201cmanufacturing activity remained largely stable,\u201d but with \u201cincreased levels of excess capacity\u201d reported by some automated manufacturers. (FRB San Francisco \u2013 Manufacturing).  \n     Dallas noted that \u201cslowing demand continued to weigh on manufacturing outlooks,\u201d and Cleveland that tariff-related forces led to \u201cmodest declines in demand for goods.\u201d (FRB Dallas \u2013 Manufacturing; FRB Cleveland \u2013 Summary of Economic Activity).\n\n   - **Capacity utilization and planning:**  \n     The Philadelphia manufacturing survey found that \u201cuncertainty was a moderate or significant constraint on capacity utilization.\u201d (FRB Philadelphia \u2013 Manufacturing).  \n     Firms in several Districts reported that their \u201ccost\u2011cutting capacity was nearly exhausted\u201d and there was \u201clittle room to cut costs further,\u201d indicating margin pressure that can affect investment and operating decisions. (FRB Atlanta \u2013 Prices).\n\n   - **Prices and inflation pressures originating in supply chains:**  \n     Multiple Districts (San Francisco, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis) reported that nonlabor input costs\u2014driven by imported components, raw materials (aluminum, copper, steel), and higher duties\u2014were rising faster than overall prices, and that firms responded with price increases. (FRB San Francisco \u2013 Manufacturing & Prices; FRB Cleveland \u2013 Prices; FRB Chicago \u2013 Prices; FRB Minneapolis \u2013 Prices).  \n     Inflation \u201ccontinued to weigh on manufacturing outlooks\u201d in Dallas and Boston, and was cited as a headwind for manufacturing and related services. (FRB Dallas \u2013 Manufacturing; FRB Boston \u2013 Manufacturing and Related Services).\n\n**In summary (within the evidence provided):**\n\n- **What disruptions?**  \n  \u2013 Tariff changes and higher import duties on raw materials, semiconductor chips, and electrical/electronic components.  \n  \u2013 Broad increases in nonlabor input costs (materials, utilities, imported components).  \n  \u2013 Logistics and warehousing disruptions related to pre\u2011tariff import surges and higher shipping/logistics costs.  \n  \u2013 Labor shortages and worker availability issues in manufacturing.  \n  \u2013 Sector-specific supplier weaknesses, particularly in the auto industry.\n\n- **How did they impact production?**  \n  \u2013 Raised production costs, prompting manufacturers to increase prices and, in some cases, fully pass through higher import costs.  \n  \u2013 Contributed to modest declines in demand and orders (e.g., overall manufacturing demand, machinery orders, and auto demand), leading to modest reductions in output (e.g., auto production down modestly; abated machinery output growth).  \n  \u2013 Constrained capacity utilization and complicated production planning, with uncertainty cited as a significant constraint.  \n  \u2013 Drove strategic changes such as reshoring steel production, offshoring apparel manufacturing, shifting final assembly to the U.S., and building additional facilities to manage tariffs and logistics costs.  \n\nWhere the findings are silent (e.g., precise quantitative impacts on lead times or specific percentages of output loss), no additional detail can be provided.",

      "reasoning": "The expected answer highlights (1) San Francisco manufacturers facing higher costs for utilities and imported semiconductor chips; (2) Chicago seeing modest declines in manufacturing demand with fabricated metals demand unchanged on balance due to offsetting sector sales; (3) tariff-induced input cost increases across many districts causing planning difficulty due to changing policies; and (4) labor shortages tied to immigration policy changes constraining production in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture.\n\nThe agent\u2019s answer correctly includes San Francisco\u2019s higher utility and imported semiconductor chip costs, tariff-related cost increases and planning uncertainty, and labor shortages linked to deportation/immigration fears. It also notes Chicago\u2019s modest decline in manufacturing demand.\n\nHowever, it does not clearly state the specific Chicago detail that fabricated metals demand was unchanged on balance because higher sales to some sectors were offset by lower sales to construction and automotive. It also adds a large amount of extra material (logistics/warehousing disruptions, multiple other districts) not required by the expected answer; while not necessarily wrong, it dilutes focus. Because one key expected point (fabricated metals unchanged-on-balance with the specific offset) is missing/unclear, the response is only partially correct.",

These service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.",

Retail and wholesale trade**\n   - **Cost pressures and pass-through:**\n     - Firms in retail trades \u201cfully passed higher import costs along to their customers in some cases\u201d (Prices > Body).\n     - Wholesalers \u201cintroduced price increases to cover elevated input costs\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Prices).\n     - Retail contacts noted tariffs had driven cost increases on goods such as coffee (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Prices).\n   - **Implication from findings:** Higher service-related input costs (tariffs, insurance, health care, utilities, and other business expenses) increased cost pressures in retail and wholesale; in many cases, these sectors responded by raising selling prices to preserve margins.\n\n   **b. Professional, business, and financial services**\n   - **Insurance, technology, and health-care cost pressures:**\n     - Professional and business services contacts reported elevated costs for insurance and technology (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Prices).\n     - A professional and business services firm in the Dallas District reported health-care and business insurance premiums rising \u201cfaster than revenues\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Prices).\n   - **Implication from findings:** Rising insurance, health-care, and technology costs compressed margins in professional and business services where revenues did not keep pace with these input costs; some firms faced difficulty fully passing these costs on, especially where overall service price growth was subdued.\n\n   **c. Healthcare sector**\n   - **Direct margin impact:**\n     - \u201cHealth care margins were affected by higher costs during the reporting period\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > RetailSales).\n     - Health care was cited as a major source of cost pressures by most business contacts (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia > Prices).\n   - **Implication from findings:** In healthcare, rising service input costs\u2014particularly health-care and insurance-related costs borne by providers and employers\u2014reduced margins. The findings do not specify the extent of price pass-through in healthcare.\n\n   **d. Transportation and logistics (nonfinancial services)**\n   - **Insurance and other nonlabor inputs:**\n     - Logistics firms faced sharply rising trucking insurance premiums (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis > Nonfinancial Services).\n     - Nonlabor input costs (including energy and materials) rose at a robust pace (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Prices; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Prices).\n   - **Implication from findings:** For logistics and transportation services, higher insurance and other nonlabor service inputs raised operating costs. The findings note these pressures but do not detail how much was passed through to customers versus absorbed in margins.\n\n   **e. Manufacturing (as a user of services and utilities)**\n   - **Relative input price growth and utilities:**\n     - Input prices \u201cgrew more moderately for services than for manufacturing firms\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City > Labor Markets), implying manufacturing was experiencing faster overall input cost growth, much of it from non-service inputs.\n     - Manufacturers reported higher utilities costs and other nonlabor inputs (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Prices; Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Manufacturing).\n   - **Implication from findings:** Manufacturing faced strong nonlabor input cost pressures, including utilities (a service). Service-related costs thus contributed to total input inflation, though the reports indicate that manufacturing input prices overall rose faster than service-sector input prices; specific effects on manufacturing margins or output are not detailed.\n\n   **f. Service sector overall**\n   - **Moderate input price growth but strong nonlabor pressures:**\n     - Input prices for services grew more moderately than for manufacturing (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City > Labor Markets).\n     - Nonlabor input costs (insurance, technology, health care, utilities) rose at a \u201crobust\u201d pace across sectors (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Prices; Prices > Body).\n     - Several Districts reported subdued service price pressures or little change in prices received (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Summary of Economic Activity; Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond > Prices).\n     - Consumer-facing businesses could not pass through all higher costs (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia > Prices).\n   - **Implication from findings:** Many service firms\u2014especially consumer-facing ones\u2014experienced margin compression: input costs (particularly insurance, health benefits, technology, and utilities) rose faster than output prices they were able or willing to charge.\n\n3. **Cross-cutting labor-cost channel via health insurance**\n\n   - Labor cost pressures intensified due to \u201coutsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses,\u201d even as wage growth softened in many sectors (LaborMarkets > Body; Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Labor Markets).\n   - This affected firms across sectors\u2014services, manufacturing, and others\u2014by raising total compensation costs.\n\n   **Implication from findings:** Employer health-insurance costs acted as a service-related input cost that increased labor-related expenses economy-wide, contributing to input cost inflation and, in sectors unable to raise prices commensurately (for example, some services and healthcare providers), to margin pressures.\n\n4. **Summary of differential impacts**\n\n- **Most directly documented negative margin impacts:** healthcare providers (margin compression), professional and business services firms (premiums rising faster than revenues), and consumer-facing service firms (unable to pass through all higher costs).\n- **Sectors where pass-through to prices is clearly reported:** retail and wholesale trade (price hikes and full pass-through of some import-related costs); some wholesalers.\n- **Sectors where service-related inputs contribute notably but are not the dominant driver:** manufacturing (utilities and other nonlabor service inputs add to broader input cost pressures, which are rising faster overall than for services).\n- **General pattern:** Nonlabor service-related costs\u2014insurance, health care/health insurance, utilities and energy, and technology\u2014are key contributors to input cost increases. Their effects vary by sector, with some able to pass costs to customers (retail/wholesale) and others primarily absorbing them as reduced margins (healthcare, various services), while manufacturing faces robust overall nonlabor cost inflation where service inputs are one component.",

      "expected": "In Chicago, leisure and hospitality sales were mixed. Categories seeing gains included restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments, as well as new light vehicle sales which were brisk due to strong underlying demand and the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases. Categories seeing softness included travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels. Used vehicle sales remained steady though dealerships in low-to-moderate income communities reported softer demand. This pattern reflects consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.",
      "answer": "Over the last 12\u201324 months in the U.S., the research points to a clear split between gaining and declining retail categories, and these patterns line up with how strained but higher\u2011income\u2011resilient consumers are behaving.\n\n**Categories seeing gains or relative strength (per findings)**  \n- **Luxury goods:** Retail sales of luxury goods \u201ccontinued to perform well\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco). The luxury end of the retail market in Manhattan \u201cremained particularly resilient\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of New York).  \n- **Athletic footwear:** Retail sales of athletic footwear \u201ccontinued to perform well\u201d (San Francisco Fed).  \n- **Some apparel / department stores:** The New York Fed reports that apparel \u201chas been selling well\u201d and that a department store\u2019s store and same\u2011store sales \u201ccontinued to strengthen\u201d and were \u201coutperforming last year,\u201d helped by \u201cresilience among mid\u2011to\u2011upper\u2011income consumers.\u201d  \n- **Autos:** Auto sales were \u201cboosted in some Districts by strong demand for electric vehicles\u201d (overall Beige Book) and \u201cnew light vehicle sales were brisk,\u201d reflecting \u201cstrong underlying demand\u201d (Chicago Fed).  \n- **Restaurants (certain segments):** Consumer spending increased at restaurants in the \u201cfast food, fast casual, and family dining segments\u201d (Chicago Fed).  \n- **Luxury/upper\u2011end travel and services:** Corporate clients \u201ccontinue to spend on travel, events, and luxury services\u201d despite a \u201cslight overall decline in consumer spending\u201d (St. Louis Fed). Within tourism, \u201conly luxury leisure travel experienced growth\u201d (Philadelphia Fed).\n\n**Categories seeing declines or softness (per findings)**  \n- **Broad consumer goods:** Retail sales \u201csoftened for consumer goods, including food products, beverages, clothing, and pet supplies\u201d (San Francisco Fed).  \n- **Food and beverages (at retail):** Sales \u201csoftened for food products\u201d and for \u201cbeverages\u201d (San Francisco Fed).  \n- **Clothing (on average):** Retail sales for clothing \u201csoftened\u201d (San Francisco Fed), even though New York reports pockets where apparel is doing well\u2014indicating mixed results by segment and region.  \n- **Furniture and home\u2011related categories:** \u201cFurniture stores saw lower sales\u201d (Dallas Fed); a furniture store reported \u201cless customer traffic\u201d (Richmond Fed). Building material and garden equipment stores also \u201csaw lower sales\u201d (Dallas Fed).  \n- **Electronics and appliances:** \u201cElectronic and appliance stores saw lower sales\u201d (Dallas Fed).  \n- **Travel\u2011related retail and hospitality (mass\u2011market):** Travel\u2011related retail spending in tourist areas was lower due to \u201cslower foot traffic\u201d (San Francisco Fed); \u201cdemand for hospitality services declined further\u201d (San Francisco Fed). Leisure and hospitality sales were \u201cmixed,\u201d with \u201csoftness in some travel-related categories, including airlines and hotels\u201d (Chicago Fed).  \n- **General retail activity:** Multiple Districts report that retail trade \u201cdecreased somewhat\u201d (San Francisco Fed), retail sales \u201cfell\u201d (Dallas Fed), and firms in the retail sector saw \u201cmoderate declines in activity\u201d (New York Fed). Retailers more broadly reported \u201csame\u2011store sales\u2026lower compared with year-earlier levels\u201d and expected full\u2011year 2025 sales growth to be \u201cflat\u201d (Atlanta Fed). Overall consumer spending on retail goods \u201cinched down\u201d (overall Beige Book).\n\n**How this reflects consumer behavior patterns (per findings)**  \n\n1. **Eroded purchasing power and value\u2011seeking**  \n   - Contacts report that \u201cinflation is eroding consumer purchasing power\u201d (St. Louis Fed).  \n   - Consumers are \u201cincreasingly focused on finding value\u201d and \u201clooking for ways to stretch their dollars\u201d (Minneapolis Fed).  \n   - A mall contact reported consumers and tenants \u201clooking for value, deals, and ways to stretch their dollars\u201d (Minneapolis Fed).  \n   - Retailers responded by offering \u201cdiscounts on select items instead of broad price increases\u201d (Cleveland Fed).  \n   - This helps explain why many everyday consumer goods categories (food products, beverages, clothing, pet supplies) are seeing softened sales: households are pulling back and trading down, forcing retailers into selective discounting and pressuring margins.\n\n2. **Polarization: weakness in lower\u2011priced goods, resilience at the mid\u2011to\u2011high end**  \n   - Demand for \u201cmore affordable goods declined\u201d (San Francisco Fed), even as retailers \u201cpassed a sizable portion of the cost increases on to consumers, with this pass\u2011through occurring mostly in the mid to high-end markets\u201d (San Francisco Fed).  \n   - The New York Fed attributes stronger department store sales to the \u201cresilience of mid\u2011to\u2011upper-income consumers.\u201d  \n   - Luxury goods and luxury leisure travel are specifically cited as continuing to perform well (San Francisco and Philadelphia Feds, New York real estate for luxury retail).  \n   - Taken together, the gains in luxury goods, athletic footwear, luxury leisure travel, and stronger department store results tied to higher\u2011income shoppers point to a bifurcation: mid\u2011 and upper\u2011income consumers remain able and willing to spend on premium and luxury items, while demand has weakened for lower\u2011priced, \u201cmore affordable\u201d goods.\n\n3. **Shift in what consumers prioritize: some \u201cexperiences\u201d and autos still win**  \n   - Despite overall softness, corporate clients \u201ccontinue to spend on travel, events, and luxury services\u201d (St. Louis Fed), and only \u201cluxury leisure travel\u201d is growing (Philadelphia Fed), suggesting that when consumers or corporate clients do spend on experiences, it skews to the high end.  \n   - Restaurant spending is up in the \u201cfast food, fast casual, and family dining\u201d segments (Chicago Fed), though diners are \u201cpull[ing] back by skipping alcoholic beverages\u201d (Atlanta Fed), indicating cautious but ongoing spending on relatively affordable dining experiences.  \n   - Strong auto and EV demand (\u201cauto sales\u2026boosted\u2026by strong demand for electric vehicles\u201d; \u201cbrisk\u201d new light vehicle sales with \u201cstrong underlying demand,\u201d overall Beige Book and Chicago Fed) shows that consumers are still willing to make large, specific big\u2011ticket purchases, even as they trim other categories.\n\n4. **Overall caution and pullback in goods spending**  \n   - Overall consumer spending on retail goods \u201cinched down\u201d (overall Beige Book), consumer spending \u201cdeclined somewhat\u201d in the Chicago District, and consumer spending \u201cdeclined slightly\u201d in the Kansas City District.  \n   - Retail and hospitality firms reported \u201clower foot traffic\u2026with increasing pressure on margins\u201d (Minneapolis Fed).  \n   - This environment of flat\u2011to\u2011declining overall retail goods spending, softer sales in many non\u2011luxury categories, and expectations of flat sales growth for 2025 (Atlanta Fed) reflects a cautious consumer who is trimming or delaying non\u2011essential and home\u2011related purchases (furniture, electronics, appliances, building materials, general consumer goods), while selectively maintaining or increasing spending on:\n     * Premium and luxury categories (luxury goods, luxury travel, high\u2011end apparel/department stores), especially among mid\u2011to\u2011upper\u2011income households, and  \n     * Certain convenience or experience\u2011oriented spends (fast food/family dining, autos).\n\nIn sum, the findings show gains concentrated in luxury, athletic/premium apparel segments, autos, and certain restaurant formats, contrasted with declines or softness in broad consumer goods, food and beverages at retail, furniture, electronics/appliances, building materials, and mass\u2011market travel/hospitality. This pattern reflects inflation\u2011driven value seeking, an overall pullback in goods spending, and a split where higher\u2011income consumers continue to support premium and luxury categories while many households cut back on everyday and big\u2011ticket home\u2011related purchases.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is specific to Chicago and highlights: gains in fast food/fast casual/family dining restaurants and brisk new light vehicle sales (with EV tax incentive timing), softness in airlines and hotels, and steady used vehicle sales with softer demand in lower-income areas\u2014interpreted as value-seeking dining and cutting back on travel. The agent\u2019s answer is much broader (multiple Fed Districts) and adds many categories (luxury goods, footwear, furniture, electronics, etc.) not in the expected response. It does mention Chicago restaurants, brisk new light vehicle sales, and softness in airlines/hotels, but it omits the key used-vehicle detail and the EV tax-incentive reason, and its consumer-behavior interpretation emphasizes polarization/luxury rather than the expected value-dining vs reduced travel framing.

      "question": "How did banking conditions differ for consumer versus business lending across districts?",
      "expected": "In Kansas City, while expectations for 2026 were optimistic, consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately, signaling stress among households. In Chicago, business loan demand decreased slightly on net with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity, while consumer loan demand increased slightly with a pickup in mortgage refinancing. In Dallas, loan demand grew overall. St. Louis reported banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions. Consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.",
      "answer": "Banking conditions differed between consumer and business lending in several ways, and those differences varied by district. Below is a district\u2011by\u2011district comparison based only on the cited findings.\n\n---\n\n### New York (Second District)\n\n- **Consumer lending**\n  * Small\u2011to\u2011medium banks reported demand for consumer loans held steady (New York > Banking and Finance).\n  * Consumer spending increased modestly and housing markets were solid (New York > Prices; Summary of Economic Activity).\n\n- **Business lending**\n  * Small\u2011to\u2011medium banks reported that demand for business loans sagged, and overall loan demand declined because of this weakness (New York > Banking and Finance; Summary of Economic Activity).\n\n**Difference:** In New York, consumer loan demand was steady, while business loan demand weakened and pulled down overall lending.\n\n---\n\n### Philadelphia (Third District)\n\n- **Consumer lending**\n  * Consumer lending excluding auto and credit cards rose strongly; auto loans rose modestly; mortgages ticked up slightly; home equity lines increased moderately (Philadelphia > Credit Conditions).\n  * Credit card volumes decreased modestly (Philadelphia > Credit Conditions).\n  * Overall bank lending (excluding credit cards) declined moderately, but banks reported strong overall credit quality despite slight rises in delinquencies and defaults (Philadelphia > Credit Conditions).\n\n- **Business lending**\n  * A continued strong decline in commercial and industrial (C&I) lending largely drove the moderate overall decline in bank lending; commercial real estate loans also declined modestly (Philadelphia > Credit Conditions).\n\n**Difference:** In Philadelphia, most consumer loan categories grew or were stable, with generally strong credit quality, whereas business lending\u2014especially C&I\u2014declined sharply and drove the overall fall in lending.\n\n---\n\n### Cleveland (Fourth District)\n\n- **Consumer lending**\n  * Lower interest rates encouraged households, coinciding with a moderate increase in loan demand (Cleveland > Financial Services).\n\n- **Business lending**\n  * Lower interest rates also encouraged businesses, coinciding with a moderate increase in overall loan demand (Cleveland > Financial Services).\n\n**Difference:** In Cleveland, both consumer and business loan demand increased moderately in response to lower rates; the findings do not indicate a strong divergence between the two segments.\n\n---\n\n### Richmond (Fifth District)\n\n- **Consumer lending**\n  * Financial institutions reported modest increases in loan delinquencies mainly within consumer portfolios, including mortgages and home equity loans (Richmond > Banking and Finance).\n\n- **Business lending**\n  * Demand for most loan types remained stable, with some institutions noting a modest increase in demand within their commercial loan portfolio (Richmond > Banking and Finance).\n\n**Difference:** In Richmond, business loan demand was stable to modestly higher, while consumer portfolios showed rising delinquencies, especially in mortgages and home equity loans.\n\n---\n\n### Chicago (Seventh District)\n\n- **Consumer lending**\n  * Loan demand in the consumer sector increased slightly; mortgage refinancing picked up (Chicago > Banking and Finance).\n  * Loan terms tightened slightly; loan rates edged down; consumer loan quality remained flat (Chicago > Banking and Finance).\n\n- **Business lending**\n  * Business loan demand decreased slightly on net (Chicago > Banking and Finance).\n  * Business loan terms tightened, and business loan quality declined modestly, partly due to weaknesses among auto\u2011industry suppliers (Chicago > Banking and Finance).\n\n**Difference:** In Chicago, consumer lending saw slightly higher demand with stable quality, while business lending saw slightly lower demand, tighter terms, and modest deterioration in loan quality.\n\n---\n\n### St. Louis (Eighth District)\n\n- **Consumer lending**\n  * Community contacts reported elevated credit card delinquency rates among consumers (St. Louis > Consumer Spending).\n\n- **Business lending**\n  * Loan demand was moderate and had been increasing over the past few months; bankers expected this rising loan demand to continue (St. Louis > Banking and Finance).\n  * Overall credit conditions remained strong (St. Louis > Summary of Economic Activity).\n\n**Difference:** In St. Louis, business lending conditions were favorable with increasing demand and strong overall credit conditions, while consumer credit, particularly credit cards, showed elevated delinquencies.\n\n---\n\n### Kansas City (Tenth District)\n\n- **Consumer lending**\n  * District banks indicated moderate deterioration in consumer lending (Kansas City > Community and Regional Banking).\n  * They linked expected future challenges in consumer lending to decreasing disposable income and expected these challenges to persist over the next six months (Kansas City > Community and Regional Banking).\n  * Despite this, banks reported that overall loan quality remained sound and that credit standards across categories showed little to no change (Kansas City > Community and Regional Banking).\n\n- **Business lending**\n  * District banks noted little to no change in loan demand across categories (which includes business loans) and reported overall loan quality as sound; credit standards related to commercial real estate and construction were stable (Kansas City > Community and Regional Banking; Real Estate and Construction).\n\n**Difference:** In Kansas City, business lending conditions were relatively stable with sound quality, while consumer lending was already experiencing moderate deterioration and was expected to face further pressure due to weaker household incomes.\n\n---\n\n### Dallas (Eleventh District)\n\n- **Consumer and business lending (aggregate)**\n  * Loan demand and loan volume in the Eleventh District rose modestly over the reporting period (Dallas > Summary of Economic Activity).\n  * Credit standards continued tightening for remaining loan types in September, though they eased slightly for residential real estate loans (Dallas > Financial Services).\n\n**Difference between consumer and business:** The findings do not break out consumer versus business loan demand explicitly; they indicate modest overall loan growth with tighter standards generally and a slight easing for residential real estate. Thus, the relative difference between consumer and business lending in Dallas is not specified.\n\n---\n\n### San Francisco (Twelfth District)\n\n- **Consumer and business lending (aggregate)**\n  * Lending activity was largely steady, but recent reductions in interest rates started to spur additional demand for loans (San Francisco > Financial Institutions).\n  * Reports indicated some increases in loan delinquencies, including those associated with small businesses (San Francisco > Community Conditions).\n\n**Difference between consumer and business:** The evidence notes increased delinquencies tied to small businesses but does not separately describe consumer delinquencies or demand. The relative conditions between consumer and business lending are therefore only partially specified: small\u2011business credit quality showed some emerging weakness, while overall lending activity was steady.\n\n---\n\n### Cross\u2011district comparison of consumer vs. business conditions\n\nBased on the above district evidence:\n\n- **Districts where consumer conditions were relatively stronger than business:**\n  * **Philadelphia:** Broad\u2011based consumer loan growth (excluding credit cards) vs. a strong decline in C&I lending.\n  * **Chicago:** Slight increase in consumer demand with flat quality vs. weaker business demand and modestly worse business loan quality.\n  * **New York:** Steady consumer loan demand vs. sagging business loan demand.\n\n- **Districts where business conditions were relatively stronger than consumer:**\n  * **St. Louis:** Rising business loan demand and strong overall credit vs. elevated consumer credit card delinquencies.\n  * **Kansas City:** Stable business demand and sound quality vs. moderate deterioration and expected challenges in consumer lending.\n  * **Richmond:** Stable to modestly rising commercial loan demand vs. modestly higher delinquencies in consumer mortgages and home equity loans.\n\n- **Districts showing broadly similar movements in both segments:**\n  * **Cleveland:** Both households and businesses saw moderately higher loan demand encouraged by lower rates.\n  * **Dallas and San Francisco:** Both report modest or steady aggregate loan demand with tighter standards (Dallas) and some emerging delinquency issues (San Francisco), but without clear, separate trajectories for consumer versus business lending.\n\nWhere the findings do not distinguish consumer from business lending (e.g., some aspects in Dallas and San Francisco), the relative differences between the two segments cannot be determined from the available evidence.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer focuses on differences in consumer vs. business lending in Kansas City (consumer portfolios deteriorated moderately while 2026 expectations were optimistic), Chicago (business demand down slightly while consumer demand up slightly due to mortgage refi), Dallas (loan demand grew overall), and St. Louis (banking activity unchanged with strong credit conditions), concluding consumer stress signs while business conditions were mixed. The agent correctly captures Chicago\u2019s split (business demand down, consumer demand up with refi) and notes Kansas City\u2019s moderate consumer deterioration with relatively stable business demand, and mentions St. Louis strong overall credit conditions with some consumer delinquency stress. However, it does not convey the Kansas City \u2018optimistic expectations for 2026\u2019 framing, characterizes St. Louis as increasing business loan demand rather than \u201cbanking activity unchanged,\u201d and adds multiple districts not in the expected summary (NY, Philadelphia, etc.), diluting alignment. It also states Dallas lacks a consumer/business breakout (fine) but doesn\u2019t succinctly tie back to the expected \u2018consumer stress vs mixed business\u2019 synthesis in the same way. Thus it contains several key facts but not all, and some emphasis differs.",

In Richmond, price growth remained moderate overall despite some pickup in price growth in the manufacturing sector. In Chicago, producer prices grew moderately with contacts reporting moderate nonlabor cost increases including energy and raw materials. Manufacturing contacts attributed some raw materials price increases to tariffs, suggesting tariffs disproportionately affected goods-producing sectors.",
      "answer": "Price pressures were stronger and more elevated in manufacturing than in services, according to the cited Federal Reserve district reports.\n\n**Manufacturing sector:**\n- Multiple districts reported **elevated input cost pressures** in manufacturing, especially for:\n  - Energy, utilities, and raw materials such as aluminum, copper, and steel (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago; Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco).\n  - Imported components, including semiconductor chips (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco; Cleveland).\n  - Tariff-related increases in imported supplies and components (San Francisco; Philadelphia; Richmond).\n- Some manufacturers **raised selling prices** to cover these higher input costs (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland; Richmond; general Beige Book evidence).\n- In the Dallas district, **manufacturing price pressures were explicitly described as elevated**, and inflation was weighing on manufacturing outlooks (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas).\n- A Kansas City manufacturing contact noted raw material costs had gone from a \u201cboil\u201d to a \u201csimmer\u201d through 2025, indicating that while pressures were high, they were **beginning to moderate** (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City).\n- Richmond survey evidence indicated manufacturers saw a **slight increase in prices received**, in contrast to services (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond).\n\n**Services sector:**\n- In contrast, **services price pressures were generally subdued**:\n  - The Dallas Fed reported that **price pressures were subdued in the services sector** in the Eleventh District over the reporting period (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas).\n  - Richmond surveys found that **service-sector firms reported virtually no change in price growth**, even as manufacturers reported a slight price increase (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond).\n  - The Kansas City Fed reported that **input prices grew more moderately for services than for manufacturing firms** over the past month (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City).\n- Some nuance within services:\n  - Service firms in Dallas **expected selling price increases to accelerate over the next 12 months** (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas).\n  - A few service-oriented firms were able to **raise prices without customer pushback** (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, as cited).\n  - Certain professional and business services reported elevated specific costs, such as insurance (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland).\n\n**Direct comparison:**\n- Across the cited districts, **manufacturing faced higher and more immediate input cost and price pressures** (especially from energy, raw materials, and imported components, often tariff-related), leading many manufacturers to raise prices.\n- **Services, by comparison, showed little current price growth and more moderate input cost increases**, though with some expectation of faster price increases in the future and isolated instances of successful price hikes.\n- Richmond and Kansas City evidence explicitly show that **manufacturing prices and input costs were rising more than those in services** over the same periods.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The agent captures the main cross-sector pattern that manufacturing price pressures were higher than services and correctly notes Dallas services were subdued while manufacturing remained elevated, plus mentions Richmond manufacturing pickup versus flat services. However, it does not clearly include the expected Chicago detail that producer prices grew moderately with moderate nonlabor cost increases (energy/raw materials), and it overextends with many additional districts and claims not in the expected answer. It does mention tariffs affecting manufacturing, but the Chicago-specific context and the framing that Richmond price growth remained moderate overall are not fully and explicitly reflected.",

      "question": "How did hiring patterns change, and what does this indicate about employer confidence?",
      "expected": "Employers showed cautious hiring behavior: More employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. Those still hiring favored temporary and part-time workers over full-time employment. In Boston, both hiring and layoffs increased modestly, indicating churn rather than net growth. Employment in IT services increased modestly with hiring in sales and technical positions - a relative bright spot. Jobseekers in Cleveland reported offers were more likely to be part-time with little or no benefits. This pattern indicates employer uncertainty and reluctance to commit to permanent workforce expansion.",
      "answer": "Hiring patterns shifted toward stability and replacement rather than expansion, and this points to cautious\u2014but not collapsing\u2014employer confidence.\n\n1. **How hiring patterns changed**\n\n- **Replacement, not expansion:** Across multiple Federal Reserve districts, most firms reported hiring mainly to backfill normal turnover rather than to grow headcount:\n  - San Francisco: \u201cMost employers hired only to replace workers, holding head counts steady over the reporting period.\u201d  \n  - Minneapolis (incl. Montana and Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula): contacts said most hiring was \u201cto replace vacancies rather than support business expansion,\u201d with one staffing contact saying employers were \u201cpredominantly hiring to replace turnover rather than for expansion.\u201d\n  - Cleveland: contacts across industries said they were hiring to backfill positions due to normal turnover and to fill open positions.\n\n- **Employment levels largely flat or only slightly up/down:**  \n  - Philadelphia: \u201cEmployment appeared to increase slightly during the current period following no change in the last period\u201d;

      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer emphasizes (1) more employers lowering head counts via layoffs/attrition, (2) a shift toward temporary/part-time rather than full-time, (3) Boston showing modest increases in both hiring and layoffs (churn), (4) IT services as a modest bright spot, and (5) Cleveland job offers more likely part-time with little/no benefits\u2014indicating uncertainty and reluctance to commit to permanent expansion.\n\nThe agent\u2019s answer captures several key elements: cautious hiring, replacement/backfill rather than expansion, mentions increased layoffs/attrition in multiple places, correctly notes Boston\u2019s modest increase in both hiring and layoffs, and identifies Boston IT services modest growth as a bright spot. It also concludes employer caution/uncertainty.\n\nHowever, it does not clearly reflect the expected central point that employers still hiring favored temporary/part-time over full-time (it gives mixed/partial evidence and even cites a Philadelphia statistic about part-time declining), and it misses the specific Cleveland point that offers were more likely part-time with little/no benefits.

**Financial conditions**  \n     - Seventh District: \u201coverall financial conditions loosened slightly,\u201d \u201cequity values rose a bit,\u201d \u201cvolatility remained unchanged.\u201d  \n     - The findings do not include a national benchmark for these specific financial conditions, so no explicit comparison to national patterns can be drawn from the evidence provided.\n\n   - **Prices/inflation**  \n     - Seventh District: there is a prices section, but the findings do not state how price changes compare to the national rate of inflation.  \n     - Thus, no explicit Seventh District vs. U.S. inflation comparison is available in the findings.\n\n   - **Agriculture / farm income**  \n     - Seventh District: \u201cProspects for 2025 farm income were unchanged.\u201d  \n     - The findings give no national farm income benchmark, so no comparison can be made.\n\n3. **Synthesis within the limits of the findings**\n\n   - The Chicago Fed\u2019s Seventh District monitoring focuses, as documented here, on:\n     - Manufacturing (demand, orders, sales, production),\n     - Overall economic activity and business contacts,\n     - Financial conditions (including equity values and volatility),\n     - Consumer spending,\n     - Prices,\n     - Agricultural/farm-income outlook.\n\n   - For the period described, the Seventh District is characterized as having:\n     - Overall activity \u201clittle changed\u201d with contacts that \u201csoftened slightly,\u201d  \n     - Consumer spending that \u201cdeclined somewhat,\u201d  \n     - Financial conditions that \u201cloosened slightly\u201d with equity values up somewhat and volatility unchanged,  \n     - Unchanged prospects for 2025 farm income.\n\n   - Compared to national conditions as summarized in the Beige Book (which reports that U.S. economic activity \u201cchanged little on balance\u201d with some modest growth and some softening across districts), these findings indicate that the Seventh District\u2019s overall activity is broadly in line with, and perhaps slightly softer than, the general national pattern.  \n\n   The findings do not provide enough detail to compare specific quantitative indicators\u2014such as unemployment rates, wage growth, housing markets, or GDP\u2014between the Seventh District and the national economy.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer lists specific Seventh District indicators and their comparison to national trends: unchanged overall activity; consumer spending declined; manufacturing demand declined modestly; employment flat; wages/benefits up modestly; prices rose moderately; financial conditions loosened slightly; construction/real estate increased slightly; farm income prospects unchanged, with relative strength in financial conditions and construction. The agent omits or fails to report several key indicators (employment, wages/benefits, construction/real estate, manufacturing decline direction/extent, prices rising moderately) and largely claims comparisons cannot be made, whereas the expected answer provides qualitative comparisons to national Beige Book trends. Thus it does not address \u201call key indicators\u201d nor the required comparisons.",
