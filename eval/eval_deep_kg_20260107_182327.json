      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "answer": "Economic activity in the Twelfth Federal Reserve District (San Francisco) has recently edged down slightly, with notable variation across sectors.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\u2019s Summary of Economic Activity:\n\n- **Overall level:** \u201cOverall economic activity edged down slightly during the reported period\u201d in the San Francisco area.  \n- **Employment:** \u201cEmployment levels were little changed during the reported period,\u201d indicating a largely flat labor market.  \n- **Prices and wages:** \u201cPrices rose modestly during the reported period,\u201d and \u201cwages grew slightly,\u201d pointing to continued but moderate upward pressure on costs.  \n- **Sectoral conditions:**\n  - **Retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate:** Activity was \u201cmixed, with activity decreasing or remaining stable across those sectors during the reported period.\u201d  \n  - **Business services:** Conditions were \u201cmixed during the reported period.\u201d  \n  - **Consumer services:** Conditions were also \u201cmixed during the reported period.\u201d  \n  - **Construction/real estate:** For the broader District, \u201cnew residential construction remained limited during the reporting period, with contacts citing competition for work as a factor.\u201d  \n  - **Specific price dynamics:** \u201cIn the Twelfth District, waning demand pushed lumber prices down during the reporting period.\u201d\n\nIn terms of turning points, the available evidence does not identify clear long\u2011run regime shifts, but it does indicate a **recent softening**: overall activity has edged down, several real-economy sectors (retail, agriculture, residential real estate) show flat or declining activity, and some input prices (such as lumber) have fallen due to waning demand. The findings do not provide a quantified multi\u2011year or historical trajectory beyond this recent period.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is that Twelfth District economic activity edged down slightly, and that retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate decreased or were stable. The agent states overall activity edged down slightly and explicitly notes retail, agriculture, and residential real estate were mixed with activity decreasing or remaining stable, matching the key facts. Extra details about employment/prices do not contradict the expected answer.",

Within this district, the documented economic activities are:\n\n1. **Manufacturing (especially autos and fabricated metals)**  \n   - The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago reports on manufacturing conditions in the Seventh District, covering \u201cdemand, orders, sales, and production for various products and industries.\u201d  \n   - Multiple contacts reported \u201cweaknesses among suppliers in the auto industry\u201d in late August and September, and \u201cfabricated metals had lower sales to the automotive industry\u201d over the same period, offsetting higher sales to other sectors.  \n   *(Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing; Banking and Finance)*\n\n2. **Agriculture**  \n   - \u201cAgriculture in the District was reported to be in good shape across most of the District.\u201d  \n   - \u201cProspects for 2025 farm income were unchanged in the Seventh District over the reporting period.\u201d  \n   - Within agriculture, prices for key crops were tracked: \u201cCorn prices in the District were down despite strong export volumes,\u201d and \u201cSoybean prices in the District were lower, in part due to the absence of new-crop soybean exports to China.\u201d  \n   *(Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Agriculture; Summary of Economic Activity)*\n\n3. **Overall economic activity and labor markets**  \n   - \u201cEconomic activity in the Seventh District was little changed over the reporting period.\u201d  \n   - \u201cContacts in the Seventh District softened slightly over the reporting period.\u201d  \n   - In labor markets, \u201ccontacts across many industries observed softening labor market conditions,\u201d and contacts in \u201cmanufacturing and construction\u201d specifically commented on worker availability.  \n   *(Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Summary of Economic Activity; Labor Markets)*\n\n4. **Banking and finance linked to real-sector activity**  \n   - The Chicago Fed reports financial conditions that are closely tied to the above sectors, including:  \n     - Weaknesses among \u201csuppliers in the auto industry\u201d (a manufacturing\u2013finance linkage).  \n     - Equity market conditions: \u201cequity values rose a bit in late August and September.\u201d  \n   *(Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Banking and Finance)*\n\n5. **Historical pattern (as far as the findings explicitly indicate)**  \n   - Across time, the Seventh District\u2019s economy is consistently associated with **manufacturing** (including automotive and fabricated metals) and **agriculture**, with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago repeatedly reporting on these sectors\u2019 conditions (demand, production, farm income, and commodity prices).  \n   *(Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing; Agriculture; Banking and Finance; Summary of Economic Activity)*\n\nBeyond these points, the findings do not provide further sector-by-sector detail (such as explicit shares for services, finance, technology, or other industries) specifically for the Seventh District.",

      "answer": "Lower- and middle-income households responded to economic conditions in the following ways, as reported in the cited Federal Reserve sources:\n\n1. **Changes in spending patterns**\n   - **Lower- and moderate-income households** \u201ctook steps to reduce spending where possible\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Community Perspectives).  \n   - Many consumers were \u201clooking for ways to stretch their dollars\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Consumer Spending).  \n   - Increased \u201csofter demand for used vehicle sales\u201d at dealerships in low\u2011 to moderate\u2011income communities was reported (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Consumer Spending).  \n   - A hotel owner in Missouri observed that the dip in travel demand was \u201cespecially pronounced among middle-class consumers\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Consumer Spending), indicating cutbacks in discretionary travel among the middle class.  \n   - In contrast, part of the increase in consumer spending was attributed to the \u201cresilience of mid\u2011 to upper\u2011income households/consumers\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Summary of Economic Activity; New York, Prices).\n\n2. **Use of assistance and basic necessities**\n   - Economic precarity among low- and moderate-income communities was \u201cevidenced by greater food pantry use\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Community Perspectives).  \n   - \u201cDemand for assistance rose particularly for other basic household necessities provided through community support organizations\u201d and for \u201cfood, other basic household necessities, and health care\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Community Conditions).  \n   - Planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid, as well as further consumer price increases linked to tariffs, were noted as *additional risks* for low- and moderate-income households (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Community Perspectives).\n\n3. **Saving, borrowing, and debt management**\n   - A banker reported \u201can increase in the number of people going to credit counseling agencies after borrowing to maintain requirements\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Banking and Finance), indicating financial stress and reliance on borrowing followed by counseling.  \n   - Community contacts reported \u201celevated credit card delinquency rates among consumers\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Consumer Spending).  \n   - In another District, borrowers were \u201cpaying down lines of credit and looking to keep more cash on hand\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Credit Conditions), indicating a more cautious stance among some consumers.  \n   - Financial institutions observed \u201cmodest increases in loan delinquencies\u2026mainly within their consumer loan portfolios, including mortgages and home equity loans\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Banking and Finance). These were reported without an explicit income breakdown but are interpreted in the findings as affecting middle\u2011income households.  \n   - Borrowers \u201cremained cautious\u2026due to high uncertainty\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Financial Institutions).  \n   - District banks expected consumer lending to \u201cface challenges over the next six months as disposable income levels decrease,\u201d with \u201ccustomers with lower personal incomes\u201d among the most likely to face challenges (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Community and Regional Banking).\n\n4. **Employment and income generation**\n   - Contacts who assist jobseekers observed clients were \u201cmore likely than before to receive offers for part-time positions with little or no benefits\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Community Conditions), suggesting that available work for many (likely lower- and middle-income) workers shifted toward lower\u2011quality, part\u2011time jobs.  \n   - Workers in one District were experiencing \u201creduced hours ranging from 15 to 18 hours per week, down from 20 to 30 hours\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Worker Experience).  \n   - Labor demand declined in some areas: \u201cAcross industries, many contacts said that declining business activity led to reduced labor demand\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Labor Markets). Firms both \u201cgrew and cut labor based on demand\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Summary of Economic Activity).  \n   - Some businesses cut operating hours (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Community Conditions), which is consistent with reduced work hours for affected employees. The findings do not provide direct evidence on increases in second jobs; they only indicate reduced hours and more part\u2011time offers.\n\n5. **Perceptions, anxiety, and expectations**\n   - \u201cContacts expressed increased anxiety and uncertainty regarding the economic situation of low- and moderate-income households in the First District\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Community Perspectives).  \n   - Lower-income households in the Boston District were \u201cthe focus of growing concern from non-business contacts regarding their economic security\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Summary of Economic Activity).  \n   - Respondents in the Kansas City District expected \u201ccustomers with lower personal incomes\u201d to be among those most likely to face challenges in the next six months and anticipated continued challenges for consumer lending as disposable income decreases (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Community and Regional Banking).  \n   - Contacts reported that \u201cinflation is eroding consumer purchasing power\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Summary of Economic Activity / St. Louis body), further contributing to pressure on household budgets.\n\n6. **Overall contrast between lower- and middle-income responses**\n   - For **lower- and moderate-income households**, the consistent pattern is: reduced discretionary spending, heavier use of food pantries and community assistance, elevated anxiety about economic security, vulnerability to cuts in SNAP and Medicaid and to further price increases, and signs of stress in credit use (credit counseling, delinquency concerns).  \n   - For **middle-income households**, the evidence is mixed:\n     - Some middle\u2011class consumers cut back on discretionary items like travel (St. Louis, Consumer Spending), experienced modest increases in delinquencies on mortgages and home equity loans (Richmond, Banking and Finance), and appeared among those seeking credit counseling (St. Louis, Banking and Finance).  \n     - At the same time, \u201cmid\u2011 to upper\u2011income households/consumers\u201d were cited as resilient and helping sustain or increase consumer spending (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Summary of Economic Activity; New York, Prices), indicating that higher\u2011income segments within or above the middle-income range maintained spending.\n\nWhere the findings are silent (for example, detailed shifts in savings rates or specific investment strategies by income group), no further behavior can be inferred beyond what is explicitly reported above.",

      "expected": "Spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong.",
      "answer": "Spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel performed strongly and showed growth, in contrast to weakness in broader travel spending:\n\n- The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that **only luxury leisure travel experienced growth within the tourism sector**, indicating that this segment expanded while other travel segments did not.  \n- Tourism contacts cited by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston said that **overall growth in demand for accommodations was fueled almost entirely by luxury accommodations rather than budget-friendly accommodations**, and they observed a **widening gap in demand between luxury and budget-friendly accommodations**. This implies that higher-income/luxury-focused travel spending was driving the accommodation market.  \n- A hotel owner in Missouri (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis) observed that the **dip in travel demand was especially pronounced among middle-class consumers**, which underscores that the weakness was concentrated outside the higher-income/luxury segment.  \n- The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis also reported that **corporate clients continued to spend on travel, events, and luxury services despite a slight overall decline in consumer spending**, further indicating resilience at the higher-income/luxury end.  \n- The Federal Reserve Bank of New York attributed part of the increase in overall consumer spending to the **resilience of mid- to upper-income households**, which is consistent with continued robust spending by higher-income consumers, including in discretionary categories such as luxury travel.\n\nOverall, across these sources, luxury travel spending by higher-income or affluent individuals is characterized as **resilient and growing**, and as a key driver of demand in the travel and accommodations market, at a time when middle-class and budget travel spending is flat or declining.",

      "question": "How did demand from domestic consumers for leisure and hospitality change?",
      "expected": "Demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged.",
      "answer": "Demand from domestic consumers for leisure and hospitality changed in a mixed and segmented way:\n\n- **Overall direction and magnitude (domestic vs. international):**  \n  Demand for leisure and hospitality services by domestic travelers was *relatively steadier or stronger* than that of international travelers, whose demand \u201cfell further\u201d over the reporting period (OverallEconomicActivity > Body). This indicates that domestic activity held up better even as the broader sector showed signs of weakness.\n\n- **Sectoral pattern within leisure and hospitality:**\n  - **Restaurants:**  \n    Domestic consumer spending **increased** at restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Consumer Spending). However, diners \u201ccontinued to pull back by skipping alcoholic beverages\u201d and \u201cskipping desserts\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta > ConsumerSpending), and customers showed \u201cstrong resistance to higher menu prices\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Prices). Casual sit-down restaurants reported a \u201csoftening in their activity\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond > Retail, Travel,and Tourism).  \n    Overall, restaurant demand from domestic consumers increased in lower- and mid-priced formats but with clear downshifting in add\u2011ons and price sensitivity.\n  - **Travel-related categories (airlines, hotels, broader hospitality):**  \n    Leisure and hospitality sales showed \u201csoftness in some travel-related categories, including airlines and hotels\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Consumer Spending). Multiple sources reported that \u201cdemand for hospitality services declined further\u201d and \u201cdemand for travel services declined further\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > RetailTradeandServices), and that leisure and hospitality \u201cexhibited weakness within nonfinancial services\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Nonfinancial Services). Hotel occupancy levels \u201ccontinued to trend downward, on net\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta > ConsumerSpending), and hospitality firms experienced \u201clower foot traffic\u201d with \u201cincreasing pressure on margins\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis > Consumer Spending).  \n    At the same time, some specific domestic markets bucked this trend: domestic tourism to New York City \u201ccontinued to grow\u201d and demand for hotel rooms there \u201ccontinued to edge up,\u201d nearing 2019 levels with \u201cexceptionally high\u201d room rates (FederalReserveBankof New York > Services).\n  - **Accommodation by price segment:**  \n    Tourism contacts reported that overall growth in demand for accommodations was \u201cfueled almost entirely by luxury accommodations rather than budget-friendly accommodations,\u201d with a \u201cwidening gap in demand between luxury accommodations and budget-friendly accommodations\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > RetailandTourism). The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia similarly reported that \u201conly luxury leisure travel experienced growth within the tourism sector\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia > TradeandServices).\n\n- **Behavioral changes and key drivers among domestic consumers:**\n  - **Cost-saving and distance choices:**  \n    Many consumers looked to \u201csave money by choosing destinations closer to home for their leisure trips,\u201d and the \u201caverage distance traveled for leisure trips declined\u201d as consumers chose closer destinations (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia > TradeandServices). Travel booking windows shortened for domestic travel (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta > ConsumerSpending).  \n    Low- and moderate-income households \u201ctook steps to reduce spending where possible\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Community Perspectives), and consumers \u201cwere reported to be looking for ways to stretch their dollars\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis > Consumer Spending).\n  - **Pullback on non-essential components:**  \n    At restaurants, diners pulled back by skipping alcoholic beverages and desserts (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta > ConsumerSpending). Retail sales \u201csoftened for beverages\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > RetailTradeandServices). Customers showed \u201cstrong resistance to higher menu prices\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Prices).\n  - **Segmented strength (luxury vs. middle/budget):**  \n    The Philadelphia Fed reported that \u201conly luxury leisure travel experienced growth\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia > TradeandServices), while tourism contacts in New England saw growth \u201cfueled almost entirely by luxury accommodations\u201d and a widening demand gap vs. budget options (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > RetailandTourism). A hotel owner in Missouri observed that the dip in travel demand was \u201cespecially pronounced among middle-class consumers\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis > Consumer Spending). Corporate clients continued to spend on \u201ctravel, events, and luxury services\u201d despite a \u201cslight overall decline in consumer spending\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis > Consumer Spending).\n\n**Synthesis:**  \nDemand from domestic consumers for leisure and hospitality became **more polarized and price-sensitive**. Relative to international travelers, domestic travelers maintained **steadier or stronger** overall demand, but within domestic demand:\n\n- **Restaurant demand** rose in fast food/fast casual/family dining, with consumers economizing on extras.  \n- **Travel-related and general hospitality demand** softened overall, with declines in airlines, many hotels, and hospitality services, though some major domestic destinations (e.g., New York City) and **luxury** segments saw continued or increased demand.  \n- Consumers increasingly **shortened trip distances** and reduced discretionary components of spending, while **luxury and corporate** segments remained comparatively resilient.",

      "expected": "Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand.",
      "answer": "According to the October 2025 Beige Book, manufacturing conditions were mixed, with several common themes:\n\n- **Demand and activity:**  \n  - Manufacturing demand **declined modestly** in late August and September in the Chicago District (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago; Cleveland contacts similarly reported modest declines in demand for manufactured goods for producers).  \n  - Richmond reported that **manufacturing activity declined slightly** (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond).  \n  - Minneapolis indicated manufacturing activity was **flat on balance**, with North Dakota manufacturing activity **up** from the prior period (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis).  \n  - Philadelphia reported a **moderate increase in manufacturing activity** and that the share of firms with higher production in Q3 was the highest in over a year (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia).  \n  - New York said manufacturing activity was **little changed after a summer uptick** (Federal Reserve Bank of New York).  \n  - Atlanta reported manufacturing activity **picked up slightly** (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta).  \n  - Dallas noted that **growth in the manufacturing sector slowed to a modest pace** and that the **pace of manufacturing output growth moderated** (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas).  \n  - San Francisco reported that **manufacturing activity remained largely stable** in recent weeks (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco).  \n  - Boston contacts said business conditions in **manufacturing and related services were slightly weaker on balance** (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston).\n\n- **Prices, costs, and margins:**  \n  - A Kansas City manufacturing firm described **raw material costs** as moving from a \u201c**boil**\u201d to a \u201c**simmer**\u201d through 2025, indicating **moderating cost pressures** (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City).  \n  - Despite that moderation in some areas, **price pressures were elevated** in the manufacturing sector in the Dallas (Eleventh) District (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas).  \n  - San Francisco reported that **input costs were higher** for manufacturers in recent weeks, including for **utilities and imported semiconductor chips**, and that **utility costs** used in manufacturing had risen (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco).  \n  - Chicago contacts highlighted **higher costs for energy and raw materials**, including aluminum, copper, and steel (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago).  \n  - Cleveland reported **robust increases in nonlabor input costs**, including imported components and chemical inputs (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland).  \n  - Kansas City noted that **input prices grew at a strong pace among manufacturing firms** over the past month (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City).  \n  - Several districts (Richmond, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Boston) indicated that **tariffs were adding to input costs** and contributing to continued or expected cost pressures in manufacturing (Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Boston).  \n  - In some districts, manufacturers **fully passed higher import costs** through to customers (Prices section, Federal Reserve System).\n\n- **Materials and supply chains:**  \n  - Across multiple districts, \u201c**most reports highlighted that materials availability for manufacturing was adequate** in recent weeks\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco; corroborated by multi\u2011district summary searches).  \n  - Chicago noted **some reshoring of steel production** and auto\u2011sector supplier weaknesses (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago; Banking and Finance and Manufacturing sections).  \n  - St. Louis manufacturing contacts reported **shipping unfinished goods to the U.S. for final assembly** to manage tariffs, shipping, and labor dynamics (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis).\n\n- **Labor and employment in manufacturing:**  \n  - Boston reported that **manufacturing employment was unchanged on balance**: some firms added workers to meet demand, while others held steady or reduced headcounts (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston).  \n  - Cleveland manufacturers reported that **employment levels increased slightly** and that **wage pressures grew modestly** (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland).  \n  - Philadelphia survey data showed **full\u2011time employment rose** for manufacturing firms (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia).  \n  - A staffing contact in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula reported **healthy labor demand in manufacturing** (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis).  \n  - San Francisco noted **wage pressures for some lower\u2011wage jobs in manufacturing**, and some contacts reported **fewer applicants per opening**, which they linked to reduced immigration (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Labor Markets).  \n  - St. Louis manufacturing contacts reported **labor shortages** tied to workers not reporting to work because of fears of deportation (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis).\n\n- **Sub\u2011sector specifics and composition of demand:**  \n  - In the Chicago District, **auto production was down modestly**, **machinery orders decreased moderately**, and fabricated metals had **lower sales to the automotive and construction industries**, contributing to softer overall demand; heavy truck production was **flat** (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago).  \n  - Chicago contacts reported **weakness among auto suppliers**, which also showed up as modest deterioration in business loan quality (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Banking and Finance).  \n  - Dallas reported that **output growth abated for machinery** within durable goods manufacturing (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas).  \n  - San Francisco mentioned **increased excess capacity among automated manufacturers**, indicating slack relative to demand (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco).  \n  - Boston manufacturing and related services saw **increased demand from medical, retail, and wholesale sectors**, even as uncertainty and tariffs were cited as headwinds (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston).  \n  - In St. Louis, at least one manufacturer reported a **downturn in new business inquiries in Q3** (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis).\n\n- **Demand drivers, tariffs, and uncertainty:**  \n  - Cleveland manufacturers attributed **modest declines in demand** for goods to **tariffs** (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland).  \n  - Boston and Richmond both cited **tariffs as a headwind** and as a factor adding to manufacturers\u2019 input costs (Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and Richmond).  \n  - Dallas reported that **slowing demand**, **domestic policy uncertainty**, and **inflation** continued to **weigh on manufacturing outlooks** (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas).  \n  - Philadelphia contacts widely reported tariff\u2011related cost pressures and expected **further tariff impacts ahead** (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia).  \n  - In several districts, some manufacturers **absorbed tariff\u2011related cost increases** in order to limit demand losses (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; various prices reports).\n\n- **Outlook and sentiment:**  \n  - Despite current headwinds, **manufacturers in several districts remained optimistic about future activity**:  \n    - Philadelphia manufacturers remained **optimistic about growth over the next six months** (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia).  \n    - New York reported that **manufacturers expect conditions to improve in the months ahead** (Federal Reserve Bank of New York).  \n  - At the same time, Boston contacts in manufacturing and related services cited **uncertainty** (including around tariffs) as a **headwind**, and Dallas contacts noted that **slowing demand and policy uncertainty** were restraining their outlook (Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and Dallas).\n\nIn summary, the October 2025 Beige Book portrays manufacturing as **broadly stable to slightly weaker on balance**, with **modest demand declines in many districts**, **mixed activity across regions and sub\u2011sectors**, **moderating but still significant input and tariff\u2011related cost pressures**, generally **adequate materials availability**, **labor markets that are tight enough to generate modest wage pressures**, and an **outlook that is cautious but still generally optimistic** among many manufacturers.

These sectors are cited as sources of increased demand where referenced.  \n       - Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Manufacturing and Related Services.  \n\n2. **Policy and cost factors affecting demand (indirect drivers through prices and costs)**  \n   - **Tariffs and trade policy:**  \n     - Tariffs were cited (in other District reports) as **a headwind for manufacturing**, leading to:\n       - **Higher import costs**, which manufacturers in some cases **fully passed on to customers**.  \n       - **Modest declines in demand for goods attributed to tariffs**.  \n       - **Cost pressures from tariffs** reported by firms.  \n       - Pre\u2011tariff import surges that raised **warehouse utilization**.  \n     - These findings indicate that tariff policy reduced demand for some manufactured goods by raising costs, though the Chicago findings do not quantify the Chicago\u2011specific magnitude.  \n       - Sources: Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia; \u201cPrices\u201d section (District reports).  \n   - **Rising utilities and input costs:**  \n     - Manufacturers reported **rising utilities costs**, and business contacts cited **utilities as a continued cost pressure**.  \n     - In the Chicago District specifically, contacts \u201chighlighted higher costs for energy and raw materials, including aluminum, copper, and steel\u201d as increasing **nonlabor input costs**.  \n     - Higher input costs, some linked to tariffs and energy prices, contributed to upward price pressure and, in other Districts, to modest demand reductions when passed through to customers.  \n       - Sources: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Prices; Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Philadelphia, San Francisco, St. Louis.  \n\n3. **Technology and production structure (affecting capacity and labor, indirectly shaping demand conditions)**  \n   - **Automation and AI adoption:**  \n     - Automated manufacturers (in the San Francisco District) reported **increased excess capacity** amid current demand conditions.  \n     - Some firms reduced employment while increasing **investment in artificial intelligence**, especially for tasks usually done by less experienced workers, and expected a **smaller need for entry\u2011level workers** because AI accelerated work.  \n     - These findings indicate a broader pattern in which technology alters labor needs and capacity utilization, but the research does not specify a quantifiable, direct effect of automation or AI on manufacturing demand in the Chicago District.  \n       - Sources: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Manufacturing and Labor Markets; Minneapolis Fed > Labor Markets.  \n\n4. **Infrastructure and energy constraints (cost and potential capacity headwinds)**  \n   - **Energy and infrastructure constraints:**  \n     - Rising utility costs, as noted above, are a consistent cost pressure.  \n     - Capacity\u2011constrained electricity infrastructure has, in at least one reported region (Rochester area, New York District), **prevented some communities from building new housing developments**, indicating that infrastructure limits can restrict real\u2011economy expansion.  \n     - The findings do not specify Chicago\u2011District\u2011specific infrastructure bottlenecks for manufacturing; they indicate that infrastructure and electricity capacity are relevant concerns but do not quantify their direct effect on Seventh District manufacturing demand.  \n       - Sources: New York Fed > Real Estate and Construction; multiple District \u201cPrices\u201d sections.  \n\n5. **Labor\u2011market and outlook indicators (how firms respond to demand)**  \n   - In the Chicago District, \u201can employment placement agency reported a continued decline in demand from manufacturers,\u201d consistent with the modest decline in manufacturing demand.  \n     - Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Labor Markets.  \n   - Across other Districts, manufacturers adjusted employment **up or down based on demand**: some firms added workers to meet demand while others reduced headcount, leaving employment roughly flat on balance. These patterns show that observed labor changes were responses to demand conditions rather than independent drivers.  \n     - Sources: Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and Richmond > Labor Markets, Manufacturing.  \n   - Despite recent modest declines in demand and orders, **more than half of surveyed firms (in other Districts) expected increases in new orders over the next six months**, and \u201cmanufacturers expect conditions to improve in the months ahead,\u201d indicating generally **positive expectations** even amid current softness.  \n     - Sources: Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and New York > Manufacturing, Prices.  \n\n6. **Temporal and sectoral pattern within the Chicago District**  \n   - **Recent period (late August\u2013September, specific Beige Book window):**  \n     - **Manufacturing demand:** \u201cdeclined modestly.\u201d  \n     - **Auto production and suppliers:** down modestly, with reported weaknesses among suppliers; heavy truck production flat.  \n     - **Fabricated metals:** overall demand **unchanged on balance**, with higher sales to some sectors fully offset by lower sales to auto and construction.  \n     - **Machinery:** orders **decreased moderately**.  \n   - The research does not provide a long\u2011run (multi\u2011year) quantified time series, only that in the most recent reporting periods demand softened modestly with notable auto\u2011sector weakness and mixed conditions in metals and machinery.  \n   - Sector composition within the Seventh District is reflected by the specific product groups explicitly mentioned: autos and auto suppliers, heavy trucks, fabricated metals, machinery, and (via price reports) metals such as aluminum, copper, and steel.  \n     - Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing; > Banking and Finance; > Prices.  \n\nIn sum, within the Chicago (Seventh) District over the period covered, manufacturing demand was driven downward mainly by weaker **auto\u2011related demand**, modest declines in **machinery orders**, and cost and price pressures linked to **tariffs**, **energy**, and **raw materials**, while some sectors (notably outside the District, such as medical, retail, and wholesale) were sources of increased demand. The research does not provide precise quantitative magnitudes for each driver, nor a detailed long\u2011run historical decomposition of demand, beyond describing these recent, sector\u2011specific and policy\u2011related influences and noting manufacturers\u2019 generally improving expectations for future orders.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is a concise summary of Chicago District manufacturing conditions: demand declined modestly; steel orders were flat; fabricated metals were unchanged because higher sales to various sectors were offset by lower sales to construction and automotive; machinery orders decreased moderately due to weaker auto demand; auto production was down modestly and heavy truck production was flat. \n\nThe agent includes several of these key points (modest decline in demand, fabricated metals offsetting pattern, machinery orders down, auto production down modestly, heavy truck flat). However, it omits the specific expected fact that steel orders were flat overall and does not clearly state that the machinery decline was driven by a decline in demand from the auto sector (it implies auto weakness but not as the direct driver of machinery orders). It also adds substantial unrelated material (tariffs, other Districts, AI, infrastructure), which is not asked for and risks confusing the core answer. Hence only partially correct.",

      "question": "What challenges did manufacturers face regarding tariff policies?",
      "expected": "Several manufacturers noted that changing tariff policies were making it difficult to plan for the future.",
      "answer": "Manufacturers faced several distinct challenges that were directly linked to tariff policies:\n\n1. **Higher input and materials costs**  \n   - Firms across multiple Federal Reserve districts reported cost pressures from tariffs, especially on imported raw materials, metals, and components. (Philadelphia, Boston, Richmond, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco)  \n   - Smaller manufacturers, in particular, experienced tariff\u2011induced cost increases. (Boston)  \n   - Manufacturing contacts specifically attributed increases in metals prices to tariffs. (Chicago)  \n   - Higher import duties raised the cost of imported supplies such as raw materials, electrical and electronic components, semiconductor chips, and some food inputs. (San Francisco)\n\n2. **Squeezed margins and pricing pressures**  \n   - Tariffs contributed to sharper selling price increases in the manufacturing sector. (Dallas, Richmond, Minneapolis)  \n   - Manufacturers often had to raise their selling prices to cover elevated input costs. (Cleveland, Minneapolis, Dallas)  \n   - Smaller manufacturers passed through a larger share of tariff\u2011induced cost increases to customers. (Boston)  \n   - Some firms, including auto manufacturers, chose to absorb tariff\u2011related cost increases rather than pass them on, to avoid further demand declines, which squeezed profit margins. (Atlanta)\n\n3. **Reduced demand for manufactured goods**  \n   - Manufacturers reported modest declines in demand for goods and explicitly attributed these declines to tariffs. (Cleveland, Boston)  \n   - Retailers expected that higher prices driven by tariffs would further soften demand, and auto manufacturers reported that tariffs were affecting new car sales. (Atlanta, Cleveland)  \n\n4. **Economic uncertainty and weaker outlooks**  \n   - Tariffs were identified as a primary driver of uncertainty among contacts and were cited as a headwind for manufacturing and related services. (Dallas, Boston)  \n   - Domestic policy uncertainty, including tariffs, weighed on manufacturing outlooks. (Dallas)  \n   - Most contacts expected further tariff impacts in the months ahead, adding to planning uncertainty. (Philadelphia)\n\n5. **Operational and supply chain disruptions**  \n   - Many businesses worked with vendors to find alternative inputs to mitigate tariff impacts on costs, indicating forced changes in sourcing strategies. (New York)  \n   - Some manufacturers began shipping unfinished goods to the U.S. for final assembly to manage tariffs, shipping, and labor dynamics. (St. Louis)  \n   - Firms reported building multiple facilities across regions to offset shipping and logistics costs, and there was some reshoring of steel production. (St. Louis, Chicago)  \n\n6. **Administrative and regulatory burdens, including misapplication of tariffs**  \n   - A computer manufacturer reported that U.S. customs was applying steel and aluminum tariffs to products that do not contain these metals, and that challenges to these tariffs were taking time to resolve. (Dallas)  \n   - These episodes point to confusion, misapplication, and slow resolution processes that created additional administrative burdens for manufacturers. (Dallas)\n\n7. **Sector\u2011specific strains (notably automotive and electronics)**  \n   - Auto manufacturers reported \u201cfeeling the pinch\u201d from tariffs on new car sales and said tariffs led them to tighten criteria for investment opportunities in the sector. (Atlanta, San Francisco)  \n   - Higher costs for imported semiconductor chips and electronic components were reported, raising production costs for electronics and related manufacturing. (San Francisco, Dallas)  \n\n8. **Inventory and logistics complications related to tariff timing**  \n   - Freight contacts reported higher warehouse utilization because goods were warehoused during a pre\u2011tariff import surge, implying manufacturers and their logistics partners had to manage inventory buildups driven by anticipated tariffs. (Cleveland)\n\nOverall, across Federal Reserve district reports, manufacturers described tariff policies as causing higher and sometimes misapplied input costs, margin pressure, weaker demand, heightened uncertainty, and disruptive changes to supply chains and operations.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is that changing tariff policies made it difficult for manufacturers to plan for the future. The agent\u2019s response includes this idea indirectly (e.g., \u201cplanning uncertainty,\u201d \u201cuncertainty and weaker outlooks\u201d) but focuses heavily on many other effects (costs, margins, demand, supply chains) and does not clearly identify the key challenge of *changing* tariff policies hindering future planning as the central point. Thus it contains some of the key fact but not in the expected form or emphasis.",

\u201cSeveral firms in the Fifth District said that slowing demand and right-sizing labor would result in imminent layoffs.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond)  \n     - \u201cThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that some firms were strategically downsizing during the reporting period.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of New York)\n\n3. **Adoption and implementation of AI and related technologies**\n   - Some employers linked larger layoffs directly to **AI adoption** reducing labor needs, especially for less-experienced roles.  \n   - Evidence:  \n     - \u201cSome professional service companies indicated that larger recent layoffs were associated with the adoption and implementation of AI capabilities that reduced overall labor needs.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City)  \n     - \u201cIn some cases, employment reductions were accompanied by investment in artificial intelligence, particularly for positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco)\n\n4. **Funding cuts and financial shortfalls (especially in education, health care, and nonprofits)**\n   - Employers in sectors reliant on grants and external funding cited **funding reductions** as a driver of layoffs and trimmed head counts.  \n   - Evidence:  \n     - \u201cCuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education sector.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston)  \n     - \u201cCuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the health-care sector.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston)  \n     - \u201cNonprofits noted trimming head counts over the reporting period.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)  \n     -

Some employers reduced staff to operate with very lean crews or as part of broader cost\u2011effectiveness efforts.  \n   - Evidence:  \n     - \u201cSeveral grocery stores in Minnesota were reducing head count down to skeleton crews, indicating very lean staffing levels.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis \u2013 Worker Experience)  \n     -

Various sectors mentioned trimming head counts over the reporting period, generally in the context of weaker conditions or adjustment to demand:  \n   - Evidence:  \n     - \u201cHomebuilders noted trimming head counts over the reporting period.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)  \n     - \u201cHead counts dipped further in the energy sector over the reporting period.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)  \n     - \u201cSlight reductions in head counts at consumer service providers contributed to the recent small decline in employment levels.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City)  \n     - \u201cSeveral contacts in manufacturing and health care noted reductions in staff levels through attrition, layoffs, and early retirements.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco)\n\n7. **Inability to postpone previously planned workforce cuts**\n   - Some employers indicated they had delayed layoffs but eventually proceeded when conditions did not improve.  \n   - Evidence:  \n     - \u201cA manufacturer said that it could not delay workforce cuts or layoffs any longer and thus proceeded with them.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland)  \n     -

      "question": "How did employers' hiring preferences change?",
      "expected": "Employers that reported hiring generally noted improved labor availability, and some favored hiring temporary and part-time workers over offering full-time employment opportunities.",
      "answer": "Employers\u2019 hiring preferences shifted in four main ways, based on recent Federal Reserve district reports and related evidence:\n\n1. **From expansion to replacement-focused, more selective hiring**\n   * Across multiple districts, employers reported hiring mainly to **backfill turnover rather than expand headcount**. For example:\n     * Cleveland contacts said they were hiring to backfill positions due to normal turnover and to fill open positions, with some hiring for current growth.  \n     * In Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula (Minneapolis District), staffing contacts said employers were **predominantly hiring to replace turnover rather than for expansion**, and a contact in Montana stated that replacement hiring dominated over expansion hiring.  \n     * San Francisco reported that **most employers hired only to replace workers, holding head counts steady** over the period.\n   * Firms described hiring as **cautious and selective**:\n     * Dallas reported that firms remained cautious with hiring.  \n     * Chicago agricultural contacts explicitly said that **hiring was selective**, and that existing workers were more likely to stay, contributing to this selectivity.\n   * Many reports noted **softening labor demand**:\n     * Chicago and Minneapolis contacts across many industries observed softening labor market conditions, and surveys in Minneapolis found softening labor demand since the last report.\n\n2. **Greater emphasis on retaining experienced and specialized workers, with persistent demand in specific technical areas**\n   * Several districts highlighted a focus on **retaining experienced employees**:\n     * San Francisco reported that some employers were explicitly prioritizing **retention of experienced employees**.\n   * Demand remained for **specialized technical roles**, even as overall labor demand softened:\n     * Boston reported **strong demand for software and IT services**, attributed to the essential nature of these services and spillover IT investments related to AI adoption; within IT services, hiring occurred in **technical and sales positions** as employment increased modestly.\n     * San Francisco and Boston noted growing **demand for business technology services**, and San Francisco reported **wage pressures for highly specialized positions such as in AI technology**, as well as some lower-wage jobs in construction and manufacturing.\n     * At the same time, the New York Fed reported that labor demand for tech workers **remained soft** during its reporting period, indicating **nuanced rather than uniformly strong** demand in tech across regions.\n\n3. **Reduced emphasis on entry-level hiring, influenced by AI and automation**\n   * Multiple pieces of evidence indicate employers are **reducing demand for less experienced or entry-level workers**, driven partly by AI:\n     * In the San Francisco District, **employment reductions were accompanied by investments in AI**, particularly for **positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees**; AI investments were explicitly \u201ctargeted to positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees.\u201d\n     * A Minnesota advertising firm (Minneapolis District) said there would be a **smaller need for entry-level workers because AI tools get the work done faster**, specifically noting that AI tools handle entry-level work more quickly.\n     * The Kansas City District reported that adoption and implementation of AI **reduced overall labor needs** at some professional services companies, and Minneapolis contacts expected AI to have a **slight dampening effect on future labor demand**.\n   * Together, these reports indicate a shift in preferences **away from hiring entry-level/less experienced workers** for tasks that can be automated with AI, and relatively **greater value placed on specialized or higher-skill roles** (e.g., AI-related technical positions where wage pressures persisted).\n\n4. **Changing job structures and easier hiring conditions**\n   * Employers are encountering **larger applicant pools and less difficulty hiring**, which supports more selective preferences:\n     * San Francisco repeatedly noted that **the number of applicants per open position increased and employers generally found it easier to hire** across industries.\n     * Philadelphia contacts similarly reported that they **faced little trouble hiring workers**.\n   * There is evidence of a shift toward **more part-time, lower-benefit roles**:\n     * Cleveland community respondents who assist jobseekers observed that clients were **more likely than before to receive offers for part-time positions with little or no benefits**.\n   * Professionals have become **reluctant to switch jobs**, which interacts with employer preferences:\n     * Dallas reported that **professionals were reluctant to switch positions**, and more than two\u2011thirds of firms in Philadelphia reported **no change in full-time employment**, a share higher than the historical average. This supports employers\u2019 emphasis on **retention of existing experienced staff** rather than aggressive external hiring.\n\n**Timeframe and sources**\n\n- These findings come from recent **Federal Reserve District reports** (e.g., Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, San Francisco, St. Louis).  \n- The reports describe conditions **\u201cover the reporting period\u201d** or \u201crecent weeks,\u201d but the findings do not specify precise calendar years beyond references such as \u201chistorical average\u201d or \u201ccompared with typical levels.\u201d  \n- The evidence does **not** provide a clear, segmented comparison for pre\u20112010 vs. 2010\u20132019 vs. post\u20112020; instead, it documents **current and recent shifts**: more selective, replacement-focused hiring; stronger emphasis on experienced and specialized workers; reduced need for entry-level roles due to AI; and greater prevalence of part-time, lower-benefit offers.  \n\nThe findings do **not** clearly indicate broad shifts in preference between technical skills, soft skills, or formal credentials beyond:\n- Persistent or strong demand for **technical / IT / AI-related skills** in some districts.\n- No explicit evidence of a systematic move toward or away from **soft skills** or **degrees/credentials** as primary hiring criteria.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says employers reported improved labor availability and some shifted toward hiring temporary and part-time workers rather than offering full-time roles. The agent does mention easier hiring/larger applicant pools (improved availability) and notes increased part-time offers with little/no benefits, which aligns with the part-time aspect. However, it does not clearly capture the key point about favoring temporary workers, and much of the response adds unrelated shifts (replacement vs expansion, AI/entry-level, specialized retention) that are not part of the expected answer. Thus it includes some but not all key facts.",

      "question": "What drove labor cost pressures to intensify?",
      "expected": "Labor cost pressures intensified in recent weeks due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses.",
      "answer": "Labor cost pressures intensified primarily due to three related drivers identified in the findings:\n\n1. **Sharp increases in employer-sponsored health insurance costs (main driver)**  \n   - A labor markets source reports that \u201clabor cost pressures intensified in recent weeks due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses.\u201d  \n   - A Philadelphia Fed prices contact noted that health\u2011care costs rose \u201cby nearly 10 percent from a year earlier,\u201d and most business contacts cited health care and insurance as continuing cost pressures.  \n   - These increases directly raised employers\u2019 per\u2011employee labor costs even where wages themselves were growing only modestly.\n\n2. **Persistent wage pressures in specific sectors and occupations**  \n   - The San Francisco Fed reports that wage pressures \u201cpersisted for highly specialized positions, such as in AI technology, and for some lower wage jobs in construction and manufacturing.\u201d  \n   - The New York Fed notes strong wage growth in construction, leisure and hospitality, wholesale, and education in its District.  \n   - Nearly three\u2011quarters of hospitality and tourism firms in the Minneapolis Fed District reported wage increases of three percent or more.  \n   - These sector\u2011 and role\u2011specific wage increases pushed labor costs up locally, even as several Districts (Atlanta, Minneapolis, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco) reported that overall wage growth was modest or easing.\n\n3. **Labor supply constraints that forced firms to pay more**  \n   - A construction firm in Memphis (St. Louis Fed District) reported that \u201ca reduced labor pool was driving up labor costs,\u201d with related reports of labor shortages in construction and manufacturing due to workers not reporting to work because of fears of deportation.  \n   - A construction contact in the Philadelphia Fed District stated that reduced availability of foreign\u2011born workers would create a significant labor shortage if construction demand picked up, and another noted that a decline in foreign\u2011born workers was already causing delays at a jobsite.  \n   - The Boston Fed reported that labor shortages were contributing to upward pressure on construction costs, and that expected reductions in seasonal visas raised retail contacts\u2019 concerns about future labor supply.  \n   - Difficulties finding enough labor led to labor shortfalls in agriculture and resource\u2011related industries in the San Francisco Fed District.  \n   - These supply constraints meant employers in affected sectors had to offer higher wages or improved compensation to attract and retain workers, adding to labor cost pressures.\n\n**Context and magnitude over time (as far as specified in the findings):**  \n- Across many Districts, overall wage growth had returned to or remained near modest pre\u2011pandemic rates, and wage pressures were reported as easing in aggregate (e.g., Atlanta, Minneapolis, Cleveland, Philadelphia, San Francisco), which implies that the intensification in labor costs is not broad\u2011based wage inflation but rather concentrated in:\n  - rapidly rising employer health\u2011insurance and health\u2011care costs, and  \n  - pockets of persistent wage pressure tied to labor shortages and specialized skills (construction, manufacturing, AI\u2011related roles, some service industries).  \n- The phrase \u201cin recent weeks\u201d attached to the health\u2011insurance\u2011driven intensification indicates that this benefits\u2011cost shock is a comparatively recent and acute contributor within the overall timeline covered by the reports.",

      "expected": "Prices rose further during the reporting period.",
      "answer": "During the October 2025 reporting period, prices **continued to rise overall, at a generally moderate pace**, with some specific areas showing stronger movements:\n\n1. **Overall price level (broadly across sectors and regions)**\n   - Multiple Federal Reserve District reports indicated that **prices rose further during the reporting period** and that **overall prices (including consumer and producer prices) increased moderately**.  \n   - Examples include:  \n     - Chicago: \u201cPrices rose moderately in late August and September\u201d and \u201coverall, producer prices rose moderately over the period described.\u201d  \n     - Philadelphia, Richmond, San Francisco, St. Louis, and others similarly described **price growth as moderate** over the period.  \n   - The New York District reported that **the pace of price increases remained elevated but was little changed**, with **selling prices continuing to rise moderately** and **input prices rising strongly**.\n\n2. **Input costs and specific cost categories**\n   - Across several Districts, **input costs increased more than final selling prices**, implying stronger pressure on producers than on consumers:\n     - Minneapolis reported that **input price pressures were greater than the modest overall price increases** in that District.\n     - New York reported that **input prices again rose strongly**, while **selling prices rose moderately**.\n   - Specific input categories with reported increases included:\n     - **Utilities and energy-related costs**:  \n       - Boston reported that **energy prices increased by at least moderate margins**.  \n       - Philadelphia contacts cited **utilities as a source of continued cost pressures**.  \n       - San Francisco manufacturing reports noted **higher costs for utilities** in recent weeks.  \n       - New York cited elevated **energy costs** for at least one producer.\n     - **Imported semiconductor chips**:  \n       - San Francisco manufacturing contacts reported **higher input costs for imported semiconductor chips**.\n     - **Technology solutions, health care, and insurance**:  \n       - A synthesis of several District reports noted **increases in input costs for technology solutions, health care, and insurance** during the reporting period.\n     - **Copper and tools**:  \n       - Boston reported **increases in the prices of copper** and **certain tools** over the period.\n     - **General raw materials**:  \n       - A Kansas City manufacturing contact described raw material cost pressures in 2025 as moving from a \u201cboil\u201d to a \u201csimmer,\u201d indicating that while pressures remained, they were moderating relative to earlier in the year (still within an environment where prices were rising).\n\n3. **Food and agricultural commodities**\n   - In the Minneapolis District, several **agricultural commodity prices moved notably compared with a year earlier**:\n     - **Increased**: turkeys, sunflowers, canola, hogs.  \n     - **Decreased**: chickens, eggs, milk, pulse crops, wheat.\n   - Chicago agricultural reports noted that **egg prices in the District declined**, and there were **concerns about higher input costs for 2026**.\n   - Boston reported that **wholesale food prices increased by at least moderate margins** over the period.\n\n4. **Energy and related sectors**\n   - Beyond the energy price increases cited by Boston and the utilities-related cost pressures in Philadelphia and San Francisco:\n     - Kansas City energy contacts **anticipated that natural gas prices would reach their breakeven price within the year**, indicating expectations of at least some upward movement relative to current levels (in the context of 2025).\n\n5. **Sectoral and regional differences in price pressures**\n   - **Manufacturing**:\n     - Dallas reported that **price pressures were elevated in the manufacturing sector**.  \n     - Cleveland noted that **manufacturers introduced price increases to cover elevated input costs**.  \n     - Kansas City reported **strong input price growth among manufacturing firms** and described raw material costs as moderating from very high levels but still elevated.\n   - **Services**:\n     - Dallas reported that **price pressures were subdued in the services sector over the period**, though **service firms expected selling price increases to accelerate over the next 12 months**.  \n     - Kansas City noted that **input prices grew more moderately for services than for manufacturing**, but firms still anticipated raising selling prices.\n   - **Retail and consumer-facing sectors**:\n     - San Francisco reported that **retailers passed a sizable portion of upstream cost increases on to consumers**, especially in **mid- to high-end markets**.  \n     - Cleveland noted that some retail contacts **used selective discounts instead of broad price increases**, indicating some restraint in passing through cost pressures.\n\n6. **Isolated declines and downward pressures**\n   - While the overall pattern was upward, there were some indicators of easing or declines in specific measures:\n     - Minneapolis reported that **retail fuel prices decreased slightly on balance** since the previous report.  \n     - Minneapolis also reported that **a lower share of contacts raised final prices** for their products or services relative to the prior period.  \n     - Philadelphia\u2019s **diffusion indexes for prices paid and prices received in manufacturing declined** compared with the prior month, implying somewhat less intense upward pressure, though prices were still generally reported as rising moderately in that District.\n     - Some materials experienced **price declines due to waning demand** according to a composite \u201cPrices\u201d summary.\n\n7. **Expectations and outlook tied to the period**\n   - Several Districts linked the October 2025 reporting period to expectations of **continued or even accelerating price growth beyond 2025**:\n     - Atlanta reported that **contacts expected prices to continue to rise into 2026**, citing **tariff-related passthrough**.  \n     - Boston noted that **some contacts were concerned about a possible acceleration of prices in 2026**.  \n     - Philadelphia reported that **firms expected to raise prices in the coming months to offset higher costs**.  \n     - Kansas City reported that **most firms anticipated raising selling prices in 2026 at a slightly faster rate than in 2025**.  \n     - Cleveland reported that **costs were expected to grow at a strong pace in the coming months**.\n\n8. **Definition and coverage of the \u201cOctober 2025 reporting period\u201d**\n   - The sources do not define a precise date range, but the Chicago Prices section explicitly links the reporting period to **late August and September** 2025, and multiple references place the reports within the context of **late 2025** (with many outlooks framed relative to full-year 2025 and expectations for 2026).\n   - The **universe of prices** covered in these reports includes:\n     - **Consumer prices** (e.g., retail prices, apparel, food).\n     - **Producer and input prices** (raw materials, energy, utilities, imported components, technology, tools, health care, insurance).\n     - **Agricultural and commodity prices** (various crops and livestock).\n     - **Sector-specific selling prices** in manufacturing and services.\n\nSummary answer:  \nDuring the October 2025 reporting period (encompassing roughly late August and September 2025 in the underlying reports), **prices generally increased further and at a moderate pace across most regions and sectors**, with **stronger increases in many input costs (utilities, energy, imported semiconductor chips, copper, certain tools, and various commodities)**. Some specific commodities and fuels saw **mixed movements** (with certain food commodities and wholesale food rising, while some items like eggs, chickens, milk, and retail fuel prices declined). Manufacturing faced **elevated price pressures**, services saw **more subdued current pressures but expected future increases**, and across Districts there were **broad expectations that prices would continue to rise, and possibly accelerate, into 2026**.",

The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (Energy) noted rising breakeven costs for wells due to higher input costs, indicating pressure in energy production.\n\n2. **Tariffs and higher import duties**  \n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (Prices) reported that higher import duties led to widespread cost increases for imported supplies, including raw materials, electrical and electronic components, and food.  \n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (Prices) stated that tariffs were adding to firms\u2019 input costs and that some tariff-driven increases in input costs had not yet been passed on to customers.  \n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that firms continued to experience cost pressures from tariffs and that tariffs were cited as a source of continued cost pressures by most business contacts.\n\n3. **Broadly elevated nonlabor input pressures relative to overall prices**  \n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis reported that input price pressures were greater than the modest overall price increases in its District, indicating that input costs were rising faster than general producer prices.  \n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland noted that nonlabor input costs rose at a robust pace in recent weeks, continuing an already-elevated trend.\n\n4. **Labor-related input costs (not the primary but a contributing factor)**  \n   * Labor cost pressures intensified due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses (LaborMarkets > Body).  \n   * A Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia contact reported health-care costs rising nearly 10 percent from a year earlier. These increases add to overall input cost pressure, though findings emphasize that nonlabor inputs are rising more rapidly than wages and general labor costs.\n\nIn sum, the faster pace of input cost increases is mainly attributed to:  \n- Strong increases in nonlabor inputs (energy, metals, chemicals, utilities, imported components, semiconductor chips),  \n- Tariff- and duty-driven cost increases on imported supplies, and  \n- Additional pressure from rising health insurance and healthcare-related labor costs.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer attributes faster input cost increases to higher import costs and higher costs of services (insurance, health care, technology solutions). The agent clearly covers higher import costs (including tariffs/duties) and mentions insurance/health care costs. However, it does not clearly identify higher costs of services like technology solutions as a cause, and adds several other drivers (raw materials, energy, metals) that are not part of the expected key facts. Thus it contains some but not all key elements.",

These outcomes occurred during periods when interest rates were reported to have declined in related districts (Cleveland > RealEstateandConstruction).\n\n3. **In several cases, lower rates had only a limited impact because uncertainty and weak demand restrained borrowing.**  \n   - In the Atlanta District, \u201cpersistent economic uncertainty contributed to loan demand from both corporate borrowers and consumers being muted,\u201d with loan demand described as \u201cmuted amid persistent economic uncertainty\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta ? > Transportation).  \n   - A banker in the Richmond District reported that many borrowers were \u201cawaiting more certainty in interest rates\u201d and in \u201cthe overall economy\u201d before borrowing, contributing to a \u201csideline mentality\u201d (Richmond > Banking and Finance).  \n   - In the New York District, small-to-medium sized banks reported that \u201cdemand for business loans sagged,\u201d and that \u201coverall loan demand declined due to sagging demand for business loans\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of New York > BankingandFinance).  \n   - In housing, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas noted that \u201cmortgage rates dipped recently, but housing market activity remained weak despite this change\u201d (Dallas > ConstructionandRealEstate).\n\n**Overall synthesis:**  \nAcross the reports summarized, lower interest rates clearly reduced borrowing costs and were directly linked to higher demand for loans, especially in commercial construction, financial services, and some segments of business lending. However, this did not uniformly translate into stronger broad business activity: in several districts, overall business spending, investment, or sectoral output remained flat or weak. Where economic uncertainty was high and borrowers adopted a \u201csideline mentality,\u201d or where underlying demand was soft, the stimulative effect of lower interest rates on business activity was limited or muted.",

      "expected": "Activity in agriculture was generally down among reporting Districts. Agriculture conditions are strained and have further deteriorated.",
      "answer": "Conditions in the agriculture sector were mixed, with generally strong physical production but notable financial and regional stress:\n\n1. **Production and Output Conditions**\n   * Production and yields were \u201cgenerally coming in strong,\u201d indicating robust output conditions in the agriculture sector. (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)\n   * Many cotton growers were expecting their best cotton harvest in three to four years, pointing to a notable improvement in crop performance. (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)\n   * Corn production in District states within the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis District was expected to set new records compared with prior years, and soybean harvests were reported to be very strong. (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis)\n   * Agriculture in the Seventh District (Chicago Fed) was reported to be in good shape across most of the District. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)\n   * In the Sixth District, agriculture conditions were mostly healthy. (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta)\n\n2. **Differences Across Subsectors and Regions**\n   * Conditions were considerably stronger for cattle producers relative to other parts of the sector. (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City)\n   * In a recent survey, over 80% of lenders in crop\u2011heavy areas reported declines in both farm income and working capital, versus about 40% of lenders in areas with more cattle production. (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City)\n   * Agricultural conditions in the Ninth District weakened compared with the previous report. (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis)\n   * In the St. Louis District, agriculture conditions were described as strained and having further deteriorated. (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)\n\n3. **Farm Income, Credit, and Financial Conditions**\n   * Agricultural credit conditions deteriorated in the period described. (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City)\n   * Over 80% of lenders in crop\u2011heavy areas, and about 40% in cattle\u2011heavy areas, reported declines in farm income and working capital. (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City)\n   * Producer incomes in the Minneapolis District were weighed down by low crop prices and elevated expenses. (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis)\n   * Contacts in the St. Louis District reported that government support would be a critical lifeline for many farmers. (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)\n   * Farmer sentiment was weak. (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City)\n   * In the Seventh District, prospects for 2025 farm income were reported as unchanged over the period. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)\n\n4. **Market Conditions: Demand, Prices, and Trade**\n   * Overall demand for agricultural products was healthy. (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta)\n   * Domestic demand for beef, poultry, peanuts, and tobacco was strong. (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta)\n   * Grain prices remained sub\u2011profitable, meaning market prices were too low to be considered profitable. (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)\n   * Corn and wheat prices \u201cremained depressed\u201d in the Atlanta District. (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta)\n   * Soybean prices in the Chicago District were lower, in part because new\u2011crop soybean exports to China were absent. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)\n   * Trade policy volatility weighed on agricultural exports, and Chinese markets turned to Brazil for commodities such as soybean, wheat, and corn. (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta)\n   * Agricultural contacts in the Minneapolis District were concerned about the elimination of Chinese purchases of soybeans. (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis)\n   * Some commodity prices did increase: in the Minneapolis District, prices for sunflowers, canola, hogs, and turkeys rose from a year earlier, while prices for wheat, pulse crops, hay, and some others decreased. (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)\n   * Hog prices in the Chicago District increased to record territory. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)\n\n5. **Labor and Operational Constraints**\n   * Contacts in agriculture reported labor shortages due to workers not reporting to work because of fears of deportation. (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)\n   * Labor shortfalls reduced harvests in parts of the San Francisco District. (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco)\n\n6. **Environmental and Weather\u2011Related Conditions**\n   * Producers in the San Francisco District continued to experience financial strain due to commodity conditions and a recent heat wave; the heat wave was specifically cited as putting financial strain on producers. (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco)\n   * In crop\u2011heavy areas, environmental and commodity\u2011price stress was associated with the high share (over 80%) of lenders reporting declines in farm income and working capital. (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City; link inferred within that survey\u2019s context)\n   * In the St. Louis District, agricultural conditions were reported as strained and deteriorating; the findings link this overall strain to broader adverse conditions but do not specify particular weather events there. (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)\n\n7. **Policy and Support**\n   * Trade policy volatility was explicitly cited as weighing on agricultural exports. (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta)\n   * Government support was reported to be a critical lifeline for many farmers in the St. Louis District. (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)\n\n8. **Technology (Limited Evidence Within Agriculture)**\n   * Contacts in the First District cited AI adoption as driving spillover IT investments and demand for software and IT services; while this is evidence of technological adoption in the broader economy, the findings only suggest, but do not clearly document, its direct impact on farm\u2011level conditions. (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston)\n   * In the San Francisco District, some employment reductions were accompanied by investment in artificial intelligence, particularly for tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees; the findings do not specify that these investments were on farms. (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco)\n\nOverall, across the sources cited, the agriculture sector is characterized by:\n\n* Strong physical production and yields in many regions (Dallas, Minneapolis, Chicago, Atlanta).\n* Comparatively better conditions for cattle and livestock producers (Kansas City, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis).\n* Significant financial strain, especially in crop\u2011heavy areas, reflected in declining farm income, deteriorating credit conditions, and reliance on government support (Kansas City, Minneapolis, St. Louis).\n* Depressed or sub\u2011profitable prices for key crops (corn, wheat, soybeans, grain broadly), partly driven by trade policy volatility and reduced exports to China (Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas).\n* Localized labor shortages and adverse weather events contributing to reduced harvests and financial stress (St. Louis, San Francisco).",

> Energy).  \n     \u2013 Tariffs are repeatedly cited as a source of uncertainty and cost pressure: \u201cTariffs appeared to be one of the primary drivers of uncertainty among contacts\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > RetailSales); \u201cFirms reported cost pressures from tariffs\u201d and \u201cmost contacts expected further tariff impacts in the months ahead\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia > Prices); \u201cTariffs were cited by contacts as a headwind for manufacturing and related services\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > ManufacturingandRelatedServices).  \n     \u2013 These tariff-related price increases also pose risks for households: \u201cFurther increases in consumer prices linked to tariffs posed additional risks to low- and moderate-income households going forward\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Community Perspectives).\n   * **Labor supply constraints, especially linked to immigration:**  \n     \u2013 \u201cSome manufacturing industry contacts reported that the number of applicants for each open position was lower and attributed this to reduced immigration\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Labor Markets); similar comments were made by construction contacts in that District (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Labor Markets).  \n     \u2013 A construction contact in the Philadelphia District felt that \u201creduced availability of foreign-born workers would create a significant labor shortage if construction demand were to pick up\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia > Labor Markets).  \n     \u2013 Retail contacts in the Boston District were concerned that \u201cexpected reductions in seasonal visas\u201d would affect next summer\u2019s labor supply (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > LaborMarkets).  \n     \u2013 More generally, \u201cuncertainty around labor supply weighed on firms\u2019 hiring plans\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta ? > Labor Markets).\n   * **Broader uncertainty and input cost pressures:**  \n     \u2013 \u201cMany others continued to expect that elevated uncertainty would weigh down economic activity\u201d (OverallEconomicActivity > Body).  \n     \u2013 There were concerns about \u201chigher input costs for 2026\u201d in agriculture (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Agriculture), and beyond tariffs, \u201cbanking contacts reported elevated costs for technology\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Prices).  \n     \u2013 Inflation \u201ccontinued to weigh on manufacturing outlooks\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Manufacturing), and some contacts worried about possible future price acceleration (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Prices).\n\nIn sum, the reported outlook is for modest, uneven economic growth with modest near-term increases in activity expected in many areas, slowing wage growth, and continued moderate price increases. Growth prospects are supported by AI-driven technology demand, infrastructure and data-center construction, and anticipated lower interest rates, but are constrained by domestic policy uncertainty, trade policy volatility and tariffs, labor supply constraints (including those tied to immigration policy), elevated input costs, and risks from potential government shutdowns.",

(Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and San Francisco)\n\n- **Exposure to policy changes and safety\u2011net risks (lower incomes):**\n  - Planned cuts to **SNAP** and **Medicaid** \u201cposed additional risks to low\u2011 and moderate\u2011income households going forward.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Community Perspectives)\n  - Contacts cited **further increases in consumer prices linked to tariffs** as additional risks for these households. (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Community Perspectives)\n  - These factors increased financial strain, pushing low\u2011 and moderate\u2011income households to **tighten spending** and seek more external support for basics.\n\n- **Resilience and capacity to maintain discretionary/luxury spending (higher incomes):**\n  - Mid\u2011 to upper\u2011income households were repeatedly described as **\u201cresilient,\u201d** and this resilience was explicitly tied to **increases in consumer spending** at the aggregate level. (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Summary of Economic Activity)\n  - This group maintained or increased **spending on non\u2011essential and luxury items**, such as luxury retail goods and corporate travel and events. (Federal Reserve Banks of San Francisco and St. Louis)\n  - Retailers\u2019 ability to pass through cost increases occurred **\u201cmostly in the mid to high\u2011end markets,\u201d** implying that higher\u2011income consumers absorbed higher prices without reducing spending as sharply. (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Prices)\n\n**Overall synthesis**\n\n- **Low- and moderate-income households** responded to economic shocks, rising prices, and anticipated cuts to SNAP/Medicaid by **cutting spending wherever possible**, particularly on discretionary items, and by **increasing use of assistance** for necessities like food, health care, and housing. Their patterns are driven by **economic precarity, falling or constrained disposable income, and heavy exposure to changes in the social safety net.**\n\n- **Mid\u2011 to upper\u2011income households** showed **resilient spending**, helping drive overall consumer spending growth. They continued to spend on **higher\u2011end and luxury goods and services**, even as overall consumer spending softened.

      "expected": "Some employers cited increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies as one of the reasons for lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. This occurred alongside other factors like weaker demand and elevated economic uncertainty. Overall employment levels were largely stable, but demand for labor was generally muted, with more employers reporting layoffs and attrition.",
      "answer": "Based on the Beige Book passages identified, the relationship between AI investment and employment trends is as follows, with effects varying by district and sector:\n\n1. **AI investment is linked to higher IT investment and modest job growth in IT services (Boston / First District).**  \n   - First District contacts reported that **AI adoption was \u201ca factor driving spillover IT investments\u201d** and that this **supported strong demand for software and IT services** (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Software and IT Services).  \n   - In the same district, the Beige Book notes that **employment in IT services increased modestly**, with **hiring in sales and technical positions** (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Labor Markets).  \n   - Thus, in Boston\u2019s district, AI-related investment is associated with **strong demand and modest employment gains in IT services**.\n\n2. **AI adoption and investment are associated with reduced labor needs, especially for less-experienced and entry-level workers (Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco).**  \n   - In the Minneapolis District, **artificial intelligence was expected to have a slight dampening effect on future labor demand**, and a **Minnesota advertising firm** reported there would be **\u201ca smaller need for entry-level workers because AI tools get the work done faster\u201d** (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis > Labor Markets).  \n   - In the Kansas City District, **\u201cthe adoption and implementation of AI capabilities reduced overall labor needs at some professional service companies\u201d**, and **larger recent layoffs** at these firms were **associated with** this AI adoption (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City > Labor Markets).  \n   - In the San Francisco District, the Beige Book reports that **\u201cin some cases, employment reductions were accompanied by investment in artificial intelligence, particularly for positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees\u201d** (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Labor Markets).  \n   - Taken together, these districts show a relationship where **AI investment and implementation coincide with or are reported as drivers of employment reductions**, focused on **entry-level and less-experienced roles** and **reduced overall labor needs** in some professional services.\n\n3. **AI-related skills face wage pressure even as some broader tech demand is soft (San Francisco, New York).**  \n   - In the San Francisco District, **\u201cwage pressures persisted for highly specialized positions, such as in AI technology\u201d** (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Labor Markets), indicating that **AI-related human capital remains in high demand and commands higher wages**, even where AI investment is associated with job cuts in other roles.  \n   - By contrast, the New York District reports that **labor demand for tech workers remained soft** (Federal Reserve Bank of New York > Labor Markets). The findings do not specify that this softness is caused by AI; they only co-occur in the broader context of technology and labor.\n\n4. **District-level pattern: mixed effects depending on sector and worker type.**  \n   - **Boston (First District):** AI adoption is explicitly tied to **increased IT/AI-related investment and modest employment growth in IT services** (Boston > Software and IT Services; Boston > Labor Markets).  \n   - **Minneapolis:** AI is expected to **slightly dampen future labor demand**, particularly **reducing need for entry-level workers** (Minneapolis > Labor Markets).  \n   - **Kansas City:** AI capabilities are directly linked to **reduced overall labor needs and larger layoffs** in some professional service firms (Kansas City > Labor Markets).  \n   - **San Francisco:** AI investment co-occurs with **employment reductions for less-experienced roles**, but **wage pressures** remain high for **specialized AI positions** (San Francisco > Labor Markets).\n\nOverall, in the Beige Book evidence reviewed, the relationship between AI investment and employment trends is:\n\n- **Positive for demand and employment in IT/software and highly specialized AI roles** (strong IT demand and modest IT hiring in Boston; wage pressures for AI specialists in San Francisco),  \n- **Negative for overall labor needs and especially for entry-level or less-experienced positions in some services sectors**, where AI adoption and investment are explicitly linked to **layoffs, reduced hiring needs, and expected dampening of future labor demand** (Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco).\n\nThe findings do not provide a quantified, system-wide correlation, but they consistently describe **AI investment as both a driver of IT-sector growth and a contributor to reduced labor demand in certain occupations and districts.**",

      "reasoning": "The expected answer emphasizes that some employers cited increased AI investment as a reason for lowering headcounts via layoffs and attrition, alongside weaker demand/uncertainty; overall employment was largely stable with muted labor demand and more layoffs/attrition. The agent correctly captures that AI adoption/investment is associated with reduced labor needs and employment reductions/layoffs in some districts (notably Kansas City and San Francisco) and mentions dampened labor demand (Minneapolis). However, it adds substantial extra framing about AI driving IT investment and modest job growth (Boston) and wage pressure for AI specialists, which is not part of the expected relationship summary. More importantly, it does not clearly include the key Beige Book context that overall employment was largely stable and labor demand muted with increased layoffs/attrition, nor does it explicitly mention attrition as part of the headcount reduction mechanism tied to AI investment.

Across reporting districts, activity in agriculture was generally down, with trade uncertainty adding to sector challenges.",
      "answer": "Trade-related concerns affected the agriculture sector differently across districts, mainly through export-market disruptions and price effects, rather than through production volumes.\n\n1. **Chicago District (Seventh District)**  \n   * Performance: Agriculture was reported to be \u201cin good shape across most of the District,\u201d with strong conditions overall.  \n   * Trade-related impact:  \n     * Soybean prices in the District were lower \u201cin part due to the absence of new-crop soybean exports to China.\u201d  \n     * Corn prices were down \u201cdespite strong export volumes.\u201d  \n   * Effect: Trade shocks (loss of the Chinese soybean market and broader trade-policy volatility) depressed key crop prices even while output and exports were strong, weighing on farm incomes.\n\n2. **Minneapolis District (Ninth District)**  \n   * Performance:  \n     * Corn production in District states was expected to \u201cset new records compared with prior years,\u201d and soybean harvests were \u201cvery strong.\u201d  \n     * Producer incomes were \u201cweighed down by low crop prices.\u201d  \n     * District commodity prices showed a mixed pattern: soybeans, wheat, hay, pulse crops, milk, and some poultry products decreased from a year earlier, while sunflowers, canola, cattle, and hogs increased.  \n   * Trade-related impact:  \n     * Agricultural contacts were \u201cconcerned about the elimination of Chinese purchases of soybeans,\u201d and more generally about China\u2019s elimination of soybean purchases during the period.  \n     * Soybean prices in the District decreased from a year earlier.  \n   * Effect: The loss of Chinese demand for soybeans contributed to lower soybean prices and, together with broader trade-policy volatility, reduced producer incomes despite record or very strong crop output.\n\n3. **Atlanta District (Sixth District)**  \n   * Performance: The findings report that agriculture conditions in the Sixth District were \u201cmostly healthy,\u201d and domestic demand for beef, poultry, peanuts, and tobacco was strong.  \n   * Trade-related impact:  \n     * \u201cTrade policy volatility weighed on agricultural exports.\u201d  \n     * Chinese markets \u201cturned to Brazil for commodities such as soybean, wheat, and corn.\u201d  \n   * Effect: For export-oriented crops (notably soybeans, wheat, and corn), the shift of Chinese demand to Brazil and general trade-policy volatility created headwinds for exports. The findings do not quantify district-specific price or income effects, but they indicate that export prospects were negatively affected while domestic-demand-oriented products (e.g., beef, poultry) fared better.\n\n4. **Kansas City District (Tenth District)**  \n   * Performance:  \n     * A survey found \u201cover 80 percent of lenders in crop-heavy areas versus about 40 percent of lenders in areas with more cattle production reported declines in both farm income and working capital.\u201d  \n   * Trade-related impact:  \n     * The findings do not directly tie this divergence to specific trade measures in this district, but in the broader evidence, crop prices (especially soybeans and some grains) were more adversely affected by trade shocks than livestock in other districts (e.g., Minneapolis, Chicago).  \n   * Effect: Crop-heavy areas experienced much more widespread declines in farm income and working capital than cattle-focused areas, consistent with crop producers being more exposed to negative trade-related price shocks.\n\n5. **St. Louis District (Eighth District)**  \n   * Performance:  \n     * Contacts reported that government support would be \u201ca critical lifeline for many farmers in the District.\u201d  \n   * Trade-related impact:  \n     * The findings do not specify particular tariffs or export losses for this district, only that farmers needed substantial support.  \n   * Effect: While the exact trade channel is not detailed, the need for government support is consistent with broader price and income pressures seen in other trade-exposed agricultural districts.\n\n6. **San Francisco District (Twelfth District)**  \n   * Performance:  \n     * Labor shortfalls \u201creduced harvests\u201d in agriculture and resource-related industries.  \n   * Trade-related impact:  \n     * Higher import duties \u201cincreased the cost of imported supplies, including raw materials, electrical and electronic components, and food,\u201d but the findings do not isolate agriculture-specific input categories beyond \u201cfood.\u201d  \n   * Effect: In this district, trade-related cost increases for imported supplies added input-cost pressure, while labor shortages constrained harvests. The findings do not quantify the net effect on farm income or prices at the district level.\n\n7. **Cross-district trade-related mechanisms**  \n   * Loss of Chinese soybean demand:  \n     * Chicago: \u201cNew-crop soybean exports to China were absent,\u201d contributing to lower soybean prices.  \n     * Minneapolis: Contacts were concerned about \u201cChina\u2019s elimination of purchases of soybeans,\u201d and soybean prices decreased from a year earlier.  \n     * Atlanta-related evidence: Chinese markets \u201cturned to Brazil for commodities such as soybean, wheat, and corn,\u201d implying reduced U.S. export opportunities.  \n   * Trade policy volatility:  \n     * Reported as weighing on agricultural exports in the Atlanta District.  \n   * Tariffs and import duties affecting agriculture-related prices and inputs:  \n     * Cleveland and Boston: Tariffs drove cost increases on beef and coffee and were linked to higher consumer prices, with foreign producers adjusting prices in response to tariffs.  \n     * San Francisco: Higher import duties broadly increased costs of imported supplies, including food.  \n   * Overall, the districts most explicitly affected on the output side by trade concerns were those with significant exposure to export crops like soybeans and corn (Chicago, Minneapolis, and, via export channels, Atlanta), where strong production coexisted with depressed prices and weaker farm incomes.\n\nIn summary, across districts, trade-related concerns mainly:\n- Depressed prices and incomes for export-oriented row crops (especially soybeans, also corn) in districts like Chicago and Minneapolis, despite strong yields and production.\n- Weighed on agricultural exports in districts exposed to international markets (e.g., Atlanta), particularly where China shifted purchases to other suppliers.\n- Had less adverse reported impact on livestock producers (e.g., cattle) relative to crop producers in some districts (Kansas City).\n- Raised input or consumer prices for certain food products and imported supplies in some regions (Cleveland, Boston, San Francisco), though the direct farm-level impact is only partially specified.",

      "answer": "Federal policy changes\u2014primarily reductions in federal benefit programs and heightened uncertainty around federal grants and funding\u2014have negatively affected nonprofits across multiple Federal Reserve Districts by reducing and destabilizing their funding, constraining services, and pressuring staffing and operations.\n\nAcross districts including Cleveland, New York, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Dallas, Chicago, and Boston, the Beige Book\u2013based evidence shows:\n\n1. **Funding decreases and uncertainty (multi-district)**\n   - A semiannual survey of nonprofits in the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\u2019s District reported that a growing share of nonprofits had funding decrease over the past six months.  \n   - Nonprofits in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s District reported challenges due to reductions in federal benefit programs and \u201cunpredictable funding.\u201d  \n   - In the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\u2019s District, at least one contact noted that uncertainty about the status of federal funding slowed previously planned projects.  \n   - Community support organizations in the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\u2019s District had their ability to provide assistance limited by funding and grant cuts.\n\n2. **Operational impacts on service delivery**\n   - In the San Francisco District, funding cuts and grant cuts limited community support organizations\u2019 ability to provide assistance precisely as demand for assistance rose, including for food, basic household necessities, and health care.  \n   - Across districts, community support organizations and other nonprofits reported that reduced and unpredictable funding constrained their capacity to meet elevated demand for social services.\n\n3. **Staffing and workforce effects**\n   - In the Cleveland District, respondents said the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants.  \n   - In the Dallas District, nonprofits reported trimming headcounts over the reporting period.  \n   - In the Boston District, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the health-care and education sectors, which are part of the nonprofit landscape in that region.\n\n4. **Financial strain and cost pressures**\n   - In the New York District, nonprofits and community service providers reported that reductions in federal benefit programs and financial distress related to Medicaid added to their financial pressures, alongside rising business costs such as insurance.  \n   - In the Chicago District, contacts reported increased operating costs (e.g., insurance) combined with reduced income and donations, forcing organizations to think carefully about which services to prioritize, and some organizations were experiencing reduced donations and income.  \n   - In the Cleveland District, one nonprofit reported having to dip into its reserve fund to cover operating expenses for the first time in more than ten years.\n\n5. **Adaptive responses by nonprofits**\n   - In the Dallas District, some nonprofits reported exploring alternate revenue streams in response to funding uncertainty and cuts.  \n   - Across districts (e.g., Chicago, New York, San Francisco), nonprofits responded to reduced and unstable funding by prioritizing among services and, in some cases, slowing or postponing projects (Philadelphia).\n\n6. **Variation by nonprofit type or mission (within the limits of the data)**\n   - The findings do not provide systematic comparisons by size or detailed mission category but do indicate that certain types of nonprofits are directly affected:\n     - **Community support organizations** (San Francisco, New York) saw their assistance constrained by funding and grant cuts even as demand for basic needs and health care services rose.  \n     - **Health-care organizations** (New York, Boston, San Francisco) experienced financial distress related to Medicaid and cuts to federal grant funding, which contributed to layoffs and increased difficulty meeting rising demand for health services.  \n     - **Education sector organizations** in the Boston District saw layoffs linked to cuts in federal grant funding.\n\n7. **Geographic scope and variation**\n   - Evidence from multiple Federal Reserve Banks\u2014Cleveland, New York, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Dallas, Chicago, Boston, and references to broader regional conditions\u2014indicates that the negative effects of federal funding changes and benefit program reductions are widespread across districts.  \n   - The available data, however, do **not** clearly quantify or compare the *degree* of impact across districts; it only documents that similar patterns (funding declines, uncertainty, staffing constraints, and service limitations) appear in multiple Federal Reserve Districts rather than being confined to any single region.\n\nIn summary, across multiple Federal Reserve Districts, federal policy changes that reduced or destabilized federal benefits and grants have led nonprofits to face decreased and unpredictable funding, constrained service delivery amid rising demand, staffing freezes and layoffs, and heightened financial pressure, with community support, health-care, and education nonprofits explicitly identified as affected. The findings show these effects are multi-district but do not specify precise differences in severity between districts.",

Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Summary of Economic Activity).  \n- At the same time, **some tariff\u2011driven input cost increases had not yet been passed along to customers**, indicating incomplete or delayed pass\u2011through in parts of the sector (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Prices).\n\n**Auto manufacturing**  \n- **Some auto manufacturers reported that they were absorbing tariff\u2011related increases rather than passing them on** (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Prices).  \n- In particular, **some auto manufacturers stated that they were absorbing these increases to prevent further declines in demand** (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Prices).  \n- This contrasts with the broader manufacturing pattern where pass\u2011through was often higher.\n\n**Retail (consumer\u2011facing, mid\u2011 to high\u2011end markets, and smaller retailers)**  \n- **Retailers passed a sizable portion of cost increases on to consumers**, with the pass\u2011through **occurring mostly in mid\u2011 to high\u2011end markets** (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Prices).  \n- In some cases, **firms in retail trades fully passed higher import costs along to their customers** (Prices > Body).  \n- A **major retailer adjusted price increases item by item based on demand elasticity**, tailoring tariff\u2011related price hikes to how sensitive demand was for each product (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Prices).  \n- Several **smaller retailers reported that they had already raised prices because of tariffs**, and it was noted that **price increases by smaller retailers would affect consumers since these are consumer\u2011facing firms** (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Prices).  \n- However, **consumer\u2011facing businesses across sectors reported an inability to pass through all higher costs to consumers**, indicating partial rather than full pass\u2011through in many cases (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Prices).  \n- Some retail contacts chose **selective pricing strategies**\u2014\u201csome retail contacts raised prices only on select items rather than across the board,\u201d and others **offered discounts on select items instead of broad price increases** (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Prices).  \n- Some retailers also **tried to hold off passing tariff\u2011related cost increases on to consumers for as long as possible** (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Prices).\n\n**Suppliers, wholesalers, and foreign producers**  \n- **Many suppliers absorbed some of the price increases** resulting from higher import duties, indicating cost absorption upstream (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Prices).  \n- **Wholesalers introduced price increases to cover elevated input costs**, shifting part of the tariff burden downstream (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Prices).  \n- **Some suppliers raised prices while citing tariffs as justification, even when their goods were not subject to increased levies**, suggesting strategic use of tariff news to support price hikes (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Prices).  \n- On the international side, **foreign producers cut prices to retain market share in the face of tariffs** and were **factoring in tariffs when setting their prices** (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Prices), effectively offsetting part of the tariff impact via lower export prices.\n\n**Cross\u2011sector patterns and non\u2011price strategies**  \n- Across firms and markets generally, **the extent of tariff pass\u2011through to final prices was highly variable** (Prices > Body).  \n- **Smaller manufacturers and retailers** were relatively more likely to **pass a larger share of cost increases to customers** (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Prices; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Prices).  \n- Many businesses, across sectors, **sought alternative inputs from vendors to mitigate the impact of tariffs on their costs** and continued to **strategize around how to structure prices in consideration of new tariffs**, indicating sourcing changes and ongoing pricing strategy adjustments rather than reliance solely on direct price increases (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Prices).  \n- In addition, **some tariff\u2011driven increases in input costs had not yet been passed along to customers**, and contacts reported that **price pass\u2011through resulting from tariffs had just begun**, with expectations that **prices would continue to rise into 2026 due to ongoing tariff\u2011related pass\u2011through** (Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and Atlanta, Prices).  \n\n**Summary by sector**  \n- **Manufacturing (non\u2011auto):** Often raised prices, sometimes fully passing through higher import costs; smaller manufacturers especially passed on a larger share, though some cost increases remained unpassed.  \n- **Auto manufacturing:** More inclined to **absorb** tariff\u2011related cost increases to support demand, with less pass\u2011through to final prices.  \n- **Retail (particularly mid\u2011 to high\u2011end and smaller retailers):** Frequently **passed through a sizable or even full share of cost increases**, but with selective and elasticity\u2011based pricing and, in some cases, delays or partial pass\u2011through.  \n- **Suppliers/wholesalers/foreign producers:** Mixed strategies, including **partial cost absorption, targeted price increases (sometimes opportunistic), and foreign price cuts** to preserve market share.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer emphasizes two main patterns: (1) in manufacturing and retail, some firms fully passed tariff-related import cost increases to customers; (2) other firms kept prices largely unchanged to preserve market share due to pushback from price-sensitive clients; plus (3) a Chicago retail analyst expected peak impact in first half of 2026. \n\nThe agent\u2019s answer does capture the key idea that pass-through varied by sector and that many manufacturing/retail firms passed through some or all costs, while others delayed/partially absorbed costs and were constrained by demand sensitivity/market share concerns. However, it does not clearly include the specific expected detail that some firms kept selling prices largely unchanged because of pushback from price-sensitive clients (it mentions inability/partial pass-through and holding off, but not \u201clargely unchanged\u201d with explicit client pushback as a driver). It also omits the Chicago-specific point about peak tariff impact expected in the first half of 2026. Therefore it is only partially correct.",

      "question": "What was the relationship between federal policy and electric vehicle sales, and how did this affect overall auto sales?",
      "expected": "Auto sales were boosted in some districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September. However, in the Chicago District, light vehicle sales declined overall, especially for EVs following the end of federal tax credits. This shows the federal tax credit created a pre-expiration demand surge followed by a post-expiration decline.",
      "answer": "Federal policy\u2014specifically federal EV tax credits\u2014was directly linked to short\u2011term spikes in electric vehicle sales, and these spikes in turn boosted overall auto sales, mainly by pulling demand forward rather than creating entirely new demand.\n\n1. **Relationship between federal policy and EV sales**\n   * The Federal Reserve\u2019s Beige Book reports consistently tie EV sales surges to the federal EV tax credit and, in particular, to its scheduled expiration:\n     * \u201cStrong demand for electric vehicles occurred ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September, effectively pulling demand forward.\u201d (OverallEconomicActivity)\n     * \u201cThe pending expiration of federal EV tax credit at the end of September incentivized purchases of electric vehicles before that deadline.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Trade and Services)\n     * \u201cAutomobile dealers\u2019 robust surge in new electric vehicle sales occurred ahead of the expiration of the EV tax credit.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Consumer Spending)\n     * \u201cTax incentives for electric vehicle purchases applied to electric vehicle purchases before they ended.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Consumer Spending)\n   * These reports indicate that the main observed mechanism was **timing**: consumers advanced their EV purchases to take advantage of the federal tax credit before it expired, causing a noticeable spike in EV sales around that deadline.\n\n2. **Effect on overall auto sales**\n   * The same sources show that this policy\u2011driven surge in EV sales fed through into broader auto sales:\n     * \u201cBrisk new light vehicle sales reflected, in part, the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Consumer Spending)\n     * \u201cAuto sales were boosted in some Districts by strong demand for electric vehicles.\u201d (OverallEconomicActivity)\n     * In New Hampshire, \u201cThe rush to purchase electric vehicles before the expiration of tax credits drove the modest increase in auto sales.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Retail and Tourism)\n     * More generally, \u201cNew light vehicle sales were brisk.\u201d while \u201cUsed vehicle sales remained steady overall.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Consumer Spending)\n   * These observations indicate that:\n     * The **increase in EV sales tied to the tax credit deadline measurably raised total new light\u2011vehicle sales**, at least in the short term and in specific regions or Federal Reserve Districts.\n     * The effect is characterized as **\u201cpulling demand forward\u201d**\u2014i.e., shifting the timing of purchases to just before the credit expired\u2014rather than being described as a permanent or purely additive increase in total vehicle demand.\n\n3. **Scope and limits of the evidence**\n   * The findings attribute the observed EV sales spikes and associated boosts in overall auto sales specifically to the **federal EV tax credit and its expiration timing**.\n   * Broader federal policies mentioned in the research brief (such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, CAFE standards, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act) are not directly linked in the cited evidence to quantified changes in EV or total auto sales; the documented, empirically observed relationship is between **expiring tax credits \u2192 higher EV sales \u2192 temporarily higher overall new light\u2011vehicle sales**.\n   * The evidence does not provide detailed year\u2011by\u2011year EV market shares or a full decomposition of overall auto sales by powertrain; it only reports that EV\u2011driven surges contributed to brisk new vehicle sales while used vehicle sales stayed generally steady.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly explains that federal EV tax credits (and their expiration) pulled demand forward, creating a pre-expiration surge in EV sales that boosted overall auto sales in some districts. However, it omits a key expected detail: that in the Chicago District, light vehicle sales declined overall, especially EVs, after the tax credits ended (a post-expiration drop). The answer largely emphasizes boosts/brisk sales and does not clearly state the post-expiration decline effect in Chicago.",

      "question": "What were the multiple factors affecting labor costs, and how did they interact with wage growth?",
      "expected": "Wages grew at a modest to moderate pace across all districts. However, labor cost pressures intensified due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses. Additionally, some contacts in the Chicago District reported moderate increases in nonlabor costs including energy and higher prices for raw materials. This meant total compensation costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.",
      "answer": "Multiple factors affected labor costs, and they interacted with wage growth in the following ways, based strictly on the findings:\n\n1. **Nonlabor input costs (energy, raw materials, imported components, chemicals, technology) \u2013 indirect upward pressure on labor costs; limited direct link to wage acceleration**\n\n   - Across several Federal Reserve districts, **nonlabor input costs** (including energy, raw materials such as aluminum, copper, and steel, chemical inputs, imported components, and technology) **rose moderately to robustly and remained elevated** over the period described (Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago and Cleveland; Prices sections; Boston Prices; Cleveland banking contacts on technology costs).\n   - These higher nonlabor input costs contributed to overall **cost pressures on firms**, which are part of the environment in which labor cost and wage decisions are made.\n   - However, the findings report that **wages and benefits were up only modestly overall** (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Labor Markets), and wage growth in multiple districts **remained modest or near pre\u2011pandemic rates** (San Francisco, Philadelphia, Dallas, New York, Minneapolis, Atlanta).\n   - Thus, while nonlabor input costs increased firms\u2019 total cost burdens, the evidence indicates that **wage growth did not accelerate commensurately**; instead, wage growth stayed modest, and firms used other margins (such as price pass\u2011through and possibly profit margins) rather than broadly raising wages more rapidly.\n\n2. **Wages and benefits (including health insurance) \u2013 direct drivers of labor costs; wage growth modest, benefits costs rising faster and intensifying labor cost pressures**\n\n   - Labor costs are directly influenced by **wage and benefits levels**:\n     - \u201cWages and benefits costs were up modestly overall\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Labor Markets).\n     - Across districts, **wage growth was modest** (often in the 1\u20133 percent range where quantified) and close to **modest pre\u2011pandemic rates** (San Francisco, Philadelphia, Dallas, New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis).\n     - Wage pressures **continued to ease** in some areas (Atlanta, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Cleveland) and **wage inflation moderated** (Philadelphia).\n   - By contrast, **employer\u2011sponsored health insurance expenses** rose sharply:\n     - \u201cLabor cost pressures intensified in recent weeks due to outsized increases in employer\u2011sponsored health insurance expenses\u201d (LaborMarkets > Body).\n     - A Philadelphia contact reported **health\u2011care costs up nearly 10 percent from a year earlier**, and health care was cited as an ongoing cost pressure (Philadelphia Prices).\n     - Several reports noted **health\u2011care and business insurance premiums rising faster than revenues** (Dallas) and insurance as a significant operating cost (Chicago Agriculture; Philadelphia Prices).\n   - Interaction with wage growth:\n     - Overall **wage growth remained modest**, but **total labor costs rose more quickly** in many cases because **benefit costs (especially health insurance) increased at a much faster pace** than wages.\n     - This means **labor cost pressures intensified even without strong wage acceleration**, as rising non\u2011wage compensation components pushed up per\u2011employee labor costs.\n\n3. **Labor market tightness and reduced labor pools (including immigration effects) \u2013 localized upward wage and labor cost pressures**\n\n   - **Reduced labor pools and shortages** raised labor costs in specific sectors and regions:\n     - An unnamed construction firm in Memphis reported that **a reduced labor pool was driving up labor costs** (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Labor Markets).\n     - Some manufacturing and construction industry contacts in the San Francisco district reported **fewer applicants per open position** and attributed this to **reduced immigration** (San Francisco, Labor Markets).\n     - A Philadelphia construction contact expected **significant labor shortages** if demand picked up, due to reduced availability of foreign\u2011born workers (Philadelphia, Labor Markets).\n     - Retail contacts in New England expressed concern that **reductions in seasonal visas** could constrain next summer\u2019s labor supply (Boston, Labor Markets).\n   - In this context of tighter labor supply, there were **persistent wage pressures**:\n     - \u201cWage pressures persisted for some lower wage jobs in construction and manufacturing\u201d (San Francisco, Labor Markets).\n   - Interaction with wage growth:\n     - These supply\u2011side constraints **raised labor costs through higher wages in specific segments** (construction, some manufacturing, hospitality and tourism, certain specialized roles), even as **aggregate wage growth remained modest**.\n     - Thus, **tight labor markets and reduced labor pools exerted local upward pressure on wage growth and labor costs**, particularly in those sectors, but did not translate into broad\u2011based, rapid wage inflation across the economy.\n\n4. **Industry\u2011 and sector\u2011specific wage dynamics \u2013 heterogeneous wage growth and labor cost outcomes**\n\n   - **Sectoral differences** in wage growth translated into differing labor cost pressures:\n     - The New York Fed reported **strong wage growth** in **construction, leisure and hospitality, wholesale, and education**.\n     - Nearly **three\u2011quarters of hospitality and tourism firms** in the Minneapolis district reported **wage increases of 3 percent or more** (Minneapolis, LaborMarkets).\n     - At the same time, **several manufacturers held wages steady because of lack of profitability** (Cleveland, Labor Markets).\n     - Wage pressures persisted for **highly specialized positions, such as AI technology**, and for **some lower wage jobs in construction and manufacturing**, while wage pressures **softened across many sectors including banking, business consulting, and retail** (San Francisco, Labor Markets).\n   - Interaction with wage growth:\n     - In sectors facing strong demand or acute labor constraints (construction; leisure and hospitality; some education; specialized AI roles), **wage growth was stronger**, directly raising labor costs more quickly in those industries.\n     - In sectors with profitability challenges or softer demand (some manufacturing, some services), firms often **restrained wage growth or held wages steady**, moderating labor cost growth despite broader cost pressures.\n     - Overall, this led to **heterogeneous wage growth patterns**, with **pockets of elevated wage growth coexisting with modest or flat wages elsewhere**, and correspondingly uneven labor cost pressures by industry.\n\n5. **Firm\u2011level profitability and ability to pass through costs \u2013 constraints on wage growth despite rising overall costs**\n\n   - Some firms, especially manufacturers, reported **insufficient profitability** and responded by **holding wages steady** (Cleveland, Labor Markets).\n   - At the same time, firms faced higher nonlabor and benefit costs and had **varying ability to pass these costs through to customers**:\n     - The extent of **tariff\u2011induced input cost pass\u2011through to final prices varied across firms and markets** (Prices > Body).\n     - **Smaller manufacturers** passed through a **larger share of tariff\u2011induced cost increases** to customers (Boston, Prices).\n     - Many **consumer\u2011facing businesses** reported an **inability to pass through all higher costs** (Philadelphia, Prices).\n   - Interaction with wage growth:\n     - When firms **could not fully pass higher input and benefit costs to prices**, and profitability was weak, they were more likely to **limit wage increases** or keep them **modest**, even as other components of labor costs (benefits) rose quickly.\n     - Thus, **profitability and pricing power constrained wage growth**, but did not prevent **overall labor cost pressures from intensifying**, because non\u2011wage and nonlabor costs still increased.\n\n6. **Minimum\u2011wage considerations and cost\u2011minimizing hiring strategies \u2013 downward pressure on wage growth at the lower end**\n\n   - Some employers explicitly sought to minimize wage outlays:\n     - One restaurateur in the Cleveland district **aimed to hire at as close to minimum wage as possible in order to reduce overall costs** (Cleveland, Labor Markets).\n   - Interaction with wage growth:\n     - Such strategies **limited wage growth at the lower end of the wage distribution**, helping restrain overall wage growth even where labor cost pressures from other sources (such as benefits) were rising.\n     - As a result, **labor costs could still increase because of benefit costs and other inputs, while nominal wages at the bottom grew slowly**.\n\n7. **Structural and institutional factors: health insurance, immigration, and seasonal visas \u2013 intensifying labor cost pressures without broad wage acceleration**\n\n   - **Employer\u2011sponsored health insurance** and **health\u2011care costs** were repeatedly cited as major structural cost drivers:\n     - Outsized increases in employer\u2011sponsored health insurance expenses **intensified labor cost pressures** (LaborMarkets > Body).\n     - Health\u2011care costs rose about **10 percent year\u2011over\u2011year** for at least one business (Philadelphia, Prices), and health care was a **persistent source of cost pressure** (Philadelphia, Prices; Dallas, Prices; broader input cost reports).\n   - **Immigration\u2011related constraints** and visa policies affected labor supply (as above), feeding into wage pressures in affected sectors.\n   - Interaction with wage growth:\n     - These structural factors **raised total labor costs mainly through non\u2011wage channels (health insurance) and supply constraints**, while **wage growth, on average, remained modest**.\n     - Thus, **labor cost growth outpaced wage growth** in many cases because of these institutional cost components and supply constraints.\n\n8. **Technology, automation, and offshoring \u2013 moderating or redirecting labor cost pressures rather than raising wages**\n\n   - **Automation and AI**:\n     - In the San Francisco and Kansas City districts, some firms **reduced employment and invested in AI**, especially in roles and tasks typically done by less experienced employees (San Francisco) and in some professional services firms (Kansas City).\n     - AI adoption **reduced overall labor needs** in some professional service companies, and AI was **expected to have a slight dampening effect on future labor demand** (Minneapolis, LaborMarkets).\n   - **Offshoring and relocating production**:\n     - An apparel company **offshored manufacturing to the Caribbean** due to labor challenges, and shipped unfinished goods back to the U.S. for final assembly to manage tariffs, shipping, and labor dynamics (St. Louis, Manufacturing).\n   - Interaction with wage growth:\n     - These actions did **not primarily show up as higher wage growth**, but rather as **adjustments to the quantity and location of labor used**:\n       - By reducing domestic labor demand (through automation or offshoring), firms **limited upward pressure on domestic wages**.\n       - Offshoring in response to \u201clabor challenges\u201d indicates that when domestic labor becomes costly or hard to secure, firms may **avoid raising wages further by shifting production**, thereby containing domestic wage growth.\n     - Consequently, **technological change and offshoring functioned as mechanisms to moderate or circumvent wage growth**, even in the face of other labor cost pressures.\n\n9. **Overall pattern of interaction between these factors and wage growth**\n\n   - Across the findings, **wage growth is consistently described as modest, near pre\u2011pandemic rates, and in some cases easing**, despite:\n     - Robust or moderate increases in **nonlabor input costs**;\n     - **Outsized increases in employer\u2011sponsored health insurance and health\u2011care costs**;\n     - **Localized labor shortages and reduced labor pools**, sometimes linked to immigration constraints;\n     - Strong wage growth in particular sectors (construction, leisure and hospitality, some education, specialized AI roles).\n   - The interaction can be summarized as:\n     - **Direct wage components** of labor costs increased **only modestly on average**, with stronger increases confined to certain sectors and occupations.\n     - **Non\u2011wage components of labor costs (especially health insurance)** and **nonlabor input costs** rose significantly, leading to **intensified labor cost pressures even without broad\u2011based rapid wage growth**.\n     - **Labor market tightness** and **reduced labor supply** generated **sector\u2011specific wage pressures**, but these did not push economy\u2011wide wage growth far above historical norms.\n     - **Profitability constraints, pricing power limits, cost\u2011minimizing hiring, automation, and offshoring** acted as **checks on wage growth**, even as they did not fully offset rising benefit and other costs.\n   - As a result, the research indicates that **multiple interacting factors drove labor costs upward, but much of the acceleration in labor costs came from non\u2011wage items and sector\u2011specific pressures, while aggregate wage growth remained modest overall.**",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer centers on: (1) wages rising modestly to moderately across districts; (2) labor cost pressures intensifying mainly because employer-sponsored health insurance costs rose outsized; (3) Chicago contacts also citing moderate increases in nonlabor costs like energy and raw materials; and (4) the implication that total compensation rose faster than wages alone.\n\nThe agent does capture the key interaction that wage growth stayed modest while benefit costs\u2014especially health insurance\u2014rose faster, making total labor costs/compensation grow faster than wages. The agent also mentions nonlabor input costs (energy/raw materials) consistent with the Chicago point.\n\nHowever, the response adds many extra factors (immigration, automation, minimum wage strategies, profitability constraints, etc.) that are not part of the expected answer and could distract from the asked \u201cmultiple factors\u201d as defined in the source. It also doesn\u2019t clearly state the expected \u2018modest to moderate\u2019 wage growth across all districts (it emphasizes modest).

      "expected": "In the Chicago District, leisure and hospitality sales were mixed, with softness in some travel-related categories including airlines and hotels, but increased spending at restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments. Demand from restaurant groups remained solid, as indicated by commercial real estate leasing activity.",
      "answer": "Within the Chicago District (Seventh Federal Reserve District), the findings indicate the following relationships between consumer spending patterns and restaurant segment performance:\n\n1. **Shift of spending toward limited\u2011service segments in the District (Chicago Fed evidence)**  \n   - The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago reports that overall consumer spending in the District \u201cdeclined somewhat,\u201d with retail goods \u201cinching down.\u201d  \n   - Despite this, **consumer spending at restaurants increased specifically in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments**. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Consumer Spending)  \n   - Leisure and hospitality sales overall were \u201cmixed,\u201d with **softness in travel\u2011related categories such as airlines and hotels**, indicating that restaurant gains are not part of a broad leisure surge but are concentrated in these more affordable dining formats. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Consumer Spending)\n\n2. **Relative weakening of full\u2011service and casual sit\u2011down segments (inferred from other Districts\u2019 segment detail)**  \n   - While the Chicago Fed evidence directly documents gains only for fast food, fast casual, and family dining, segment\u2011level evidence from other Federal Reserve Districts shows that **more traditional, full\u2011service formats are softening**:\n     - \u201cCasual sit\u2011down restaurants reported a softening in their activity.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond > Retail, Travel, and Tourism)  \n     - \u201cLower sales at full\u2011service restaurants resulted in some businesses closing in the Pacific Northwest.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Retail Trade and Services)  \n   - The Chicago findings do not separately quantify full\u2011service restaurant performance, but taken together, the cross\u2011District evidence indicates that, as consumers reallocate spending, **limited\u2011service and family\u2011oriented formats are benefiting relative to full\u2011service and casual sit\u2011down restaurants**.\n\n3. **Consumer trade\u2011down behavior and price sensitivity affecting higher\u2011ticket restaurant segments**  \n   - Evidence from other Districts documents how changing spending patterns are expressed at the table, particularly in ways that are more likely to hurt higher\u2011check, full\u2011service formats:\n     - \u201cAt restaurants, diners continued to pull back by skipping desserts.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta > Consumer Spending)  \n     - \u201cAt restaurants, diners continued to pull back by skipping alcoholic beverages.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta > Consumer Spending)  \n     - \u201cCustomers showed strong resistance to higher menu prices charged by restaurants,\u201d leading some restaurants to change recipes. (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Prices)  \n   - These behaviors\u2014omitting higher\u2011margin items and resisting price increases\u2014tend to compress revenue and margins at **full\u2011service and casual sit\u2011down restaurants**, while **lower\u2011priced fast food and fast casual outlets, which are precisely where the Chicago Fed reports increased spending, are comparatively better aligned with this more price\u2011sensitive, trade\u2011down pattern**.\n\n4. **Net effect by segment for the Chicago District, based on available evidence**  \n   - **Fast food, fast casual, and family dining**: Directly reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago as experiencing **increased consumer spending**, even as overall consumer spending and retail goods spending decline somewhat.  \n   - **Broader leisure and hospitality, including travel\u2011linked food service**: Described as **mixed**, with \u201csoftness\u201d in airlines and hotels, implying weaker conditions for restaurant activity tied closely to travel. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Consumer Spending)  \n   - **Full\u2011service and casual sit\u2011down restaurants**: The Chicago District reports do not explicitly separate these segments, but consistent reports from other Federal Reserve Districts of **softening activity, strong price resistance, and even closures in full\u2011service formats** suggest that, relative to the growing limited\u2011service and family segments identified in the Chicago District, **these higher\u2011touch segments are more negatively affected by current consumer spending patterns**.\n\nIn summary, within the Chicago District as defined by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (Seventh District), a period of slightly declining overall consumer spending and weaker retail goods spending has coincided with **increased spending directed toward fast food, fast casual, and family dining restaurants**, while broader leisure and hospitality is mixed and cross\u2011District evidence indicates that **full\u2011service and casual sit\u2011down restaurants are more exposed to softening demand, price resistance, and trade\u2011down behavior.**",

In Chicago, financial conditions loosened modestly with business loan volumes increasing. However, the impact was mixed - while some reports noted improved business lending, residential real estate remained weak in Dallas and home sales were flat in Boston. The housing market's response to lower rates was more muted than commercial sectors.",
      "answer": "Across the Federal Reserve Districts covered in the findings, lower interest rates affected interest rate\u2011sensitive sectors in the following, district\u2011specific ways:\n\n**Cleveland District (Fourth District)**  \n- **Sectors affected:** Financial services and commercial construction.  \n- **Effect:** Contacts in both sectors reported **higher demand** that they explicitly **attributed to lower interest rates**.  \n  - Financial services contacts noted an **uptick in demand** and said it was **because of lower interest rates**.  \n  - Commercial construction contacts reported an **uptick in demand** and likewise **cited lower interest rates as the reason**.  \n  - Bankers in the District indicated that **lower interest rates encouraged households and businesses**, coinciding with a **moderate increase in loan demand** and expected a **sharp increase in loan demand** with further anticipated cuts.  \n- **Metrics noted:** Loan demand (household and business), demand for commercial construction projects.\n\n**Chicago District (Seventh District)**  \n- **Sector affected:** Banking and finance (business and consumer lending).  \n- **Effect:**  \n  - **Business loan rates** and **consumer loan rates** moved **down** in late August and September.  \n  - Overall financial conditions **loosened slightly** in this period.  \n  - Bond values **rose a bit**.  \n- **Metrics noted:** Lending rates (business and consumer), bond values; the findings do not specify changes in sector loan volumes for Chicago.\n\n**San Francisco District (Twelfth District)**  \n- **Sector affected:** Financial institutions / loan markets.  \n- **Effect:** Recent **reductions in interest rates** **started to spur additional demand for loans** during the reporting period.  \n- **Other sectors in the District:** Activity in **retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate** was described as **mixed**, with **activity decreasing or remaining stable**; the findings do not explicitly link this mixed performance to interest rate changes.  \n- **Metrics noted:** Loan demand; sectoral activity levels (retail, agriculture, residential real estate) without a direct causal attribution to rates.\n\n**Dallas District (Eleventh District)**  \n- **Sectors affected:**  \n  - **Financial services / commercial real estate lending:**  \n    - **Loan performance for commercial real estate loans sharply improved** in September (no explicit causal link to lower interest rates, but this metric is highlighted for an interest rate\u2011sensitive segment).  \n  - **Residential real estate / housing market:**  \n    - **Mortgage rates dipped** recently, but **housing market activity remained weak** despite the lower mortgage rates.  \n    - Builders used **mortgage rate buydowns** as an incentive to close housing deals.  \n- **Metrics noted:** Commercial real estate loan performance; mortgage rates; housing market activity.\n\n**Philadelphia District (Third District)**  \n- **Sector affected:** Bank lending (including commercial and industrial loans).  \n- **Effect:**  \n  - The **volume of bank lending excluding credit cards declined moderately**, largely driven by a **strong decline in commercial and industrial lending**, despite the broader context in which some regions reported improved lending due to lower rates.  \n  - Within this, **consumer lending excluding auto lending and credit cards rose strongly**.  \n- **Interest rates:** The findings do not directly tie these lending changes in Philadelphia to lower rates, but they contrast with other districts where lower rates coincided with higher business lending.\n\n**New York District (Second District)**  \n- **Sector affected:** Broad finance / loan markets.  \n- **Effect:**  \n  - **Overall loan demand in the District declined** during the reporting period.  \n  - Activity in the broad finance sector **weakened slightly** after a modest improvement in the prior period.  \n- **Interest rates:** The findings do not explicitly link this weakening to interest rate movements, but it contrasts with districts where lower rates were associated with increased loan demand.\n\n**Minneapolis District (Ninth District)**  \n- **Sectors affected:** Construction and real estate.  \n- **Effect:**  \n  - **Recent home sales were lower overall**, although they varied widely among larger markets in the District.  \n  - Commercial real estate in the District was **flat** during the period described.  \n- **Interest rates:** No explicit causal attribution is made to lower interest rates; the findings only note that these are interest\u2011rate\u2011sensitive sectors whose activity was weak or flat.\n\n**Atlanta District (Sixth District)**  \n- **Sectors affected:** Finance and real estate.  \n- **Effect:**  \n  - **Financial conditions loosened** in the Sixth District.  \n  - **Real estate activity increased slightly**, while **home sales declined**.  \n- **Interest rates:** The findings report looser financial conditions but do not explicitly attribute sectoral changes to lower rates.\n\n**Aggregate / cross\u2011district evidence (Overall Economic Activity)**  \n- Some reports **across districts** noted **improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates**.  \n- The **outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector**, indicating that the transmission of lower rates to sector performance was not uniform.\n\n**Summary of sectoral and geographic differences (based strictly on the findings):**\n\n- **Sectors with clearly positive responses to lower rates:**\n  - **Financial services / banking** in the **Cleveland** District: higher loan demand from households and businesses explicitly linked to lower rates.\n  - **Commercial construction** in the **Cleveland** District: higher demand tied directly to lower rates.\n  - **Loan markets** in the **San Francisco** District: recent rate reductions started to spur additional loan demand.\n  - **Business lending in some (unspecified) districts**: overall reports noted improved business lending due to lower rates.\n\n- **Sectors or districts where lower rates coincided with weak or mixed performance:**\n  - **Housing / residential real estate** in the **Dallas** District: activity remained weak despite a dip in mortgage rates.  \n  - **Residential real estate and related housing activity** in several districts (Boston, Minneapolis, Dallas, Atlanta) generally showed **flat or declining home sales or weak housing markets**, even where mortgage rates dipped; however, the findings only explicitly tie Dallas\u2019s weakness to lower mortgage rates not generating a response.\n  - **Retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate** in the **San Francisco** District: activity was mixed (decreasing or stable) without explicit causal linkage to interest rates.\n\n- **Districts where lending or finance weakened despite the broader environment of lower rates:**\n  - **Philadelphia:** Overall bank lending (excluding credit cards) declined moderately, driven by a strong decline in commercial and industrial lending, even as other districts reported rate\u2011driven loan demand increases.  \n  - **New York:** Overall loan demand and broad finance activity weakened slightly.  \n  - In these districts, the findings do not state that lower interest rates failed to stimulate lending, only that loan demand and volumes declined in the period under review.\n\nWithin the scope of the findings, the clearest causal links are:  \n- **Positive, rate\u2011driven demand increases** in **financial services and commercial construction in Cleveland** and **loan demand in San Francisco**, and  \n- **Weak housing responses** to lower mortgage rates in **Dallas**.  \n\nOther district\u2011level sector movements are described but not always explicitly tied to lower interest rates in the evidence provided.",

      "question": "How did federal funding changes affect employment in specific sectors?",
      "expected": "Federal funding changes negatively impacted employment across multiple sectors: In Boston, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in education and health-care sectors. In Cleveland, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to federal grant uncertainty. In New York, nonprofits faced challenges from reduced federal benefit programs, with community health-care centers reporting financial strain. Manufacturing employment in Boston was mixed, with one firm shedding workers to offset tariff-related cost increases.",
      "answer": "Federal funding changes affected employment in a clearly sector-specific way, with the strongest documented causal links in education and health care, and more mixed or indirect effects elsewhere.\n\n1. **Education and Health Care: direct job losses from grant cuts**\n\n   - The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston reports that **cuts to federal grant funding directly contributed to layoffs in both the education and health\u2011care sectors**. (Boston > LaborMarkets)\n   - Across the New York District, **firms in education and healthcare experienced \u201cfairly significant declines in headcounts\u201d** during the reporting period. (New York > Labor Markets)\n   - The Cleveland Fed notes that **nonprofits were not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants**, indicating hiring freezes tied to federal funding risk in grant\u2011reliant organizations, which often include education and health\u2011related nonprofits. (Cleveland > CommunityConditions)\n   - A semiannual survey of nonprofits found **a growing share reporting decreased funding over the past six months**, consistent with funding reductions leading to weaker hiring or staffing cuts. (Cleveland > CommunityConditions)\n\n   Overall, the evidence links **reductions or uncertainty in federal grants to layoffs and hiring freezes in education and health care**, implying a negative employment response in these sectors when federal funding falls.\n\n2. **Nonprofit sector more broadly: hiring restraint due to grant uncertainty**\n\n   - Beyond specific industries, a Cleveland Fed respondent reports that **the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants**. (Cleveland > CommunityConditions)\n\n   This indicates that, among grant\u2011dependent nonprofits (a category overlapping with social services, health, and education), **federal funding uncertainty reduced net hiring**.\n\n3. **Construction and infrastructure\u2011related activity: support from publicly funded projects**\n\n   - In the San Francisco District, **public infrastructure projects such as roads** were cited as examples that **\u201cbuoyed new commercial construction\u201d** and supported new commercial construction activity. (San Francisco > Real Estate and Construction)\n   - In the Minneapolis District, contacts **reported strong infrastructure activity and a positive outlook for infrastructure\u2011related work**. (Minneapolis > ConstructionandRealEstate)\n   - San Francisco also notes that **new commercial construction was supported by construction of health facilities in addition to infrastructure projects**, again tying construction activity to publicly supported projects. (San Francisco > Real Estate and Construction)\n\n   While the findings do not explicitly quantify federal dollars, these descriptions connect **public (infrastructure and health\u2011facility) investment to stronger construction activity**, implying **support for construction employment** where such projects are present.\n\n4. **Sectoral patterns around large funding shifts (stimulus and sequestration)**\n\n   The synthesis of Beige Book\u2013style evidence attributes differentiated employment responses across sectors during periods tied to large federal funding changes (e.g., stimulus and sequestration):\n\n   - During periods associated in the findings with major shifts in federal spending:\n     - The New York Fed reports **\u201cfairly significant declines in headcounts\u201d in education, healthcare, retail, construction, and transportation**. (New York > Labor Markets)\n     - Over similar periods, **wholesale, finance, business services, and personal services saw slight\u2011to\u2011modest upticks in headcounts**. (New York > Labor Markets)\n   - In the Kansas City District, employment levels **fell slightly across a broad range of sectors**, with **slight reductions in headcounts at business and consumer service providers** contributing to the overall decline. (Kansas City > Labor Markets; Kansas City > SummaryofEconomicActivity)\n\n   Taken together, this evidence associates **large, adverse federal funding shifts (e.g., sequestration in the synthesis) with broad but uneven employment declines**, concentrated in:\n   - **Education and health care** (already directly linked to grant cuts),\n   - **Retail, construction, and transportation**,  \n   while **wholesale, finance, business services, and personal services** in some cases maintained or modestly increased employment.\n\n5. **Manufacturing: mixed employment response, not clearly tied to funding shifts**\n\n   - The Boston Fed reports that **manufacturing employment was \u201cunchanged on balance\u201d**, with **some firms adding workers to meet demand and others keeping or reducing headcounts**. (Boston > LaborMarkets)\n   - The Cleveland Fed notes that **manufacturers reported employment levels increased slightly**. (Cleveland > SummaryofEconomicActivity)\n   - The Philadelphia Fed finds **full\u2011time employment rose for manufacturing firms** in survey data. (Philadelphia > Labor Markets)\n\n   These findings show **heterogeneous manufacturing employment changes**, but the research does **not** directly tie these changes to specific federal funding increases or cuts; instead, they are attributed to demand conditions and labor availability.\n\n6. **IT services, finance, and insurance: continued or modest hiring amid funding shifts**\n\n   - The Boston Fed reports that **IT services employment increased modestly**, with hiring in **technical and sales positions**. (Boston > LaborMarkets)\n   - The San Francisco Fed indicates **continued hiring in financial services and insurance**. (San Francisco > Labor Markets)\n   - The New York Fed describes **slight\u2011to\u2011modest headcount upticks in wholesale, finance, business services, and personal services**. (New York > Labor Markets)\n\n   The findings do not directly connect these increases to particular federal funding programs, but they show that **employment in these sectors was generally stable or growing even when grant\u2011funded sectors were cutting jobs**.\n\n7. **Overall causal picture from the findings**\n\n   Based strictly on the cited evidence:\n\n   - **Negative employment effects from federal funding cuts or uncertainty are clearly documented in:**\n     - **Education** (layoffs from grant cuts),\n     - **Health care** (layoffs from grant cuts),\n     - **Grant\u2011dependent nonprofits** more broadly (unfilled positions and hiring freezes),\n     - **A wider set of sectors (education, healthcare, retail, construction, transportation)** during periods associated in the synthesis with sequestration\u2011type funding reductions.\n   - **Positive or supporting employment effects from public/federal investment are suggested (though less explicitly quantified) in:**\n     - **Construction**, where **public infrastructure and health\u2011facility projects (e.g., roads, data centers, health facilities) buoyed construction activity** and infrastructure\u2011related work.\n   - **Other sectors (manufacturing, finance, insurance, IT services, wholesale, business services, personal services)** show mixed or modestly positive employment trends, with no explicit direct causal tie to federal funding changes in the evidence, but with patterns that contrast with the grant\u2011dependent sectors experiencing cuts.\n\nThus, within the scope of these findings, **federal grant cuts and funding uncertainty causally reduced employment in education, health care, and parts of the nonprofit sector, while public infrastructure\u2011related spending supported construction employment; other sectors showed employment changes that were sector\u2011specific but not clearly attributed to federal funding shifts in the available evidence.**",

      "expected": "In the Chicago District, an industry analyst noted that a fire at an aluminum plant in New York and disruptions for semiconductors from China were crimping production at several plants in the District. Heavy truck production fell slightly amid soft freight volumes. Auto production was flat despite fabricated metals orders rising modestly due to automotive sector demand.",
      "answer": "Supply chain disruptions affected manufacturing mainly through tariffs and trade policies, labor shortages, and shipping/logistics issues, with documented impacts on output, costs, and production decisions across several sectors.\n\n1. **Types of supply chain disruptions and how they affected production**\n\n   a. **Tariffs and trade policy (e.g., US\u2011China trade war)**  \n   - Disruption: Tariffs increased the cost of imported inputs, including metals, semiconductor chips, raw materials, electrical/electronic components, and food. (Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Cleveland, Chicago, Dallas)  \n   - Production impacts:  \n     * Manufacturers reported **modest declines in demand for goods**, which they explicitly **attributed to tariffs**, contributing to **modest declines in manufacturing demand and output**. (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)  \n     * Output growth **abated for machinery and transportation\u2011related durable goods**, and for most durable goods generally, in periods when tariffs and related uncertainty were weighing on outlooks. (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)  \n     * Manufacturers faced **elevated nonlabor input costs** (energy, metals such as aluminum, copper, steel, chemicals, imported components) and responded by **raising prices** to cover these costs. (Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Chicago, San Francisco, Richmond, Philadelphia)  \n     * Businesses **sought alternative inputs** or **shipped unfinished goods to the U.S. for final assembly** to manage tariffs and related shipping and labor dynamics, indicating adjustments in production processes and locations. (Federal Reserve Banks of New York, St. Louis)  \n\n   b. **Labor shortages and labor dynamics**  \n   - Disruption: Manufacturing contacts reported **labor shortages**, including workers not reporting due to **fears of deportation** and general difficulties finding enough labor. (Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis, San Francisco)  \n   - Production impacts:  \n     * Labor shortages contributed to **production delays** and **project delays** (explicitly noted in construction; manufacturing contacts also cited labor shortages as a constraint). (Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis, Philadelphia)  \n     * An apparel company **offshored manufacturing to the Caribbean** specifically **due to labor challenges**, indicating a relocation of production capacity. (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)  \n     * Firms\u2019 hiring patterns and reported plans (e.g., continued role\u2011filling into 2026) suggest labor constraints influenced **capacity utilization and expansion decisions**. (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)  \n\n   c. **Shipping, logistics costs, and port\u2011related congestion**  \n   - Disruption: Firms faced **rising shipping and logistics costs**, and freight contacts reported changes in warehouse utilization driven by **pre\u2011tariff import surges** and goods being warehoused. (Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis, Cleveland)  \n   - Production impacts:  \n     * Manufacturers **built multiple facilities across regions** and **looked for cost\u2011effective shipping strategies** to offset elevated logistics costs, implying changes in production location and network design. (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)  \n     * Some firms **shipped unfinished goods for final assembly in the U.S.** to better manage tariffs, shipping, and labor dynamics, which reflects altered production sequencing and possible delays or added complexity in production. (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)  \n\n   d. **Semiconductor and input cost pressures**  \n   - Disruption: **Costs for imported semiconductor chips** and other imported supplies rose, in part due to higher import duties. (Federal Reserve Banks of San Francisco, Cleveland, Chicago)  \n   - Production impacts:  \n     * Higher semiconductor and utility costs increased **overall input cost inflation**, prompting manufacturers to **raise output prices** and potentially constrain margins and production decisions. (Federal Reserve Banks of San Francisco, Cleveland)  \n     * Automated manufacturers reported **increased excess capacity** while demand conditions were weak, indicating that cost and demand pressures limited the effective use of installed production capacity. (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco)  \n\n   e. **Policy and macro\u2011uncertainty shocks (including COVID\u201119)**  \n   - Disruption: **Domestic policy uncertainty** and broader uncertainty (including COVID\u201119 lockdowns) weighed on manufacturing outlooks. (Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas, Philadelphia, Boston)  \n   - Production impacts:  \n     * Manufacturing activity **dipped**, and **output growth abated** for machinery, transportation\u2011related durable goods, and most durable goods in affected periods. (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)  \n     * Firms reported that uncertainty acted as a **moderate or significant constraint on capacity utilization**, limiting how fully they used existing production capacity. (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia)  \n     * Auto production was **down modestly** in specific recent periods (late August and September) alongside broader demand weakness. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)  \n\n2. **Sectors/industries most affected and specific production impacts**\n\n   a. **Automotive manufacturing**  \n   - Disruptions:  \n     * **Supplier weaknesses** and **declining demand** from the auto sector itself. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)  \n     * Tariffs affecting metals and other inputs, with some auto manufacturers feeling the pinch from tariffs on new car sales; some firms **absorbed tariff\u2011related cost increases** to avoid further demand declines. (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)  \n   - Production impacts:  \n     * **Auto production was down modestly** in late August and September. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)  \n     * **Machinery orders decreased moderately**, driven by **lower demand from the automotive industry**, and **fabricated metals** reported **lower sales to automotive**, partially offsetting sales to other sectors. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)  \n     * These conditions contributed to **modest declines in manufacturing demand and output** for transportation\u2011related durable goods. (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)  \n\n   b. **Machinery and broader durable goods**  \n   - Disruptions: Tariff\u2011driven cost increases, policy uncertainty, and weakened downstream sectors (notably automotive). (Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas, Chicago, Cleveland, Boston)  \n   - Production impacts:  \n     * **Output growth abated for machinery** and **for most durable goods**, including transportation\u2011related durables. (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)  \n     * **Machinery orders declined moderately** in late August and September, driven by the automotive sector\u2019s weaker demand. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)  \n\n   c. **Electronics and semiconductor\u2011using manufacturing**  \n   - Disruptions: **Higher costs for imported semiconductor chips** and higher import duties on electrical and electronic components. (Federal Reserve Banks of San Francisco, Dallas, San Francisco \u2013 Prices)  \n   - Production impacts:  \n     * Manufacturers in electronics\u2011related segments experienced **higher input costs**; reports highlight **adequate materials availability** but **elevated costs** and **excess capacity**, suggesting that demand and cost conditions, rather than physical shortages, constrained effective production. (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco)  \n\n   d. **Food and related manufacturing**  \n   - Disruptions: Higher import duties increased the cost of imported **food inputs**; tariffs raised costs on items like chocolate; ingredient and energy costs were elevated for at least one brewing company. (Federal Reserve Banks of San Francisco, Cleveland, New York)  \n   - Production impacts:  \n     * Evidence points primarily to **increased production costs**; the findings do not specify explicit output declines or shutdowns in food manufacturing, only higher costs and some softer demand for packaged snack products. (Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, New York, Cleveland, San Francisco)  \n\n   e. **Textiles/apparel**  \n   - Disruptions: **Labor shortages** and challenges in securing adequate labor. (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)  \n   - Production impacts:  \n     * An apparel company **offshored manufacturing to the Caribbean** due to labor challenges, representing a shift in production location and likely changes in domestic output. (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)  \n\n3. **Nature of the production impacts (across sectors)**\n\n   Across manufacturing, the documented impacts of these disruptions on production include:\n\n   - **Decreased output/volume:**  \n     * **Modest declines in auto production**, and **abated output growth** in machinery and transportation\u2011related durables. (Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Dallas)  \n     * **Manufacturing demand declined modestly**, and manufacturers reported **modest declines in demand for goods** attributed to tariffs, leading to slower output growth. (Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas)  \n\n   - **Production delays/slowdowns and capacity under\u2011utilization:**  \n     * Labor shortages resulted in **project delays** and were reported as a constraint by manufacturers. (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)  \n     * Firms faced **uncertainty** that was a **moderate or significant constraint on capacity utilization**, and automated manufacturers reported **excess capacity**, indicating slowdowns relative to potential output. (Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, San Francisco)  \n\n   - **Increased production costs:**  \n     * **Nonlabor input costs** (metals, chemicals, imported components, semiconductor chips, energy, utilities) rose at a **robust pace**, driven partly by tariffs and higher import duties. (Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Chicago, San Francisco, Richmond, Philadelphia, Dallas)  \n     * Manufacturers generally **raised prices** to cover these elevated input costs, and some **absorbed tariff\u2011related increases** (notably in autos) to avoid further demand declines. (Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Atlanta, Richmond)  \n\n   - **Changes in production configuration and location:**  \n     * Firms **built multiple facilities across regions** to offset shipping and logistics costs. (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)  \n     * Some manufacturers **shipped unfinished goods to the U.S. for final assembly** rather than fully producing abroad, to better manage tariffs and labor/shipping constraints. (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)  \n     * An apparel firm **offshored manufacturing** to the Caribbean due to domestic labor shortages. (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)  \n     * A few contacts reported **reshoring of steel production** in response to changing conditions. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)  \n\n   - **Employment and operating adjustments:**  \n     * Some manufacturers **postponed layoffs** while waiting for industrial production to recover, later stating they could no longer delay workforce cuts, indicating that weakened demand and cost pressures had concrete effects on staffing and implied production levels. (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland)  \n     * Reports indicated **cuts to operating hours** at some businesses, reflecting reduced utilization of production capacity. (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco \u2013 Community Conditions)  \n\nIn sum, the research indicates that since 2015, manufacturing supply chains have been disrupted mainly by tariffs and trade policies, labor shortages, and rising shipping and input costs. These disruptions, particularly evident in automotive and other durable goods, led to modest but clear declines in output and demand, under\u2011utilized capacity, higher production costs, and structural changes in where and how production is carried out.",

These service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.",
      "answer": "Service-related costs that contributed to input cost increases, and their sectoral effects, are as follows (all statements are tied to the cited Federal Reserve sources and survey contexts):\n\n1. **Key service-related cost categories that increased**\n\n   * **Insurance (including health, business, liability, and trucking insurance)**\n     * Professional and business services contacts reported **elevated insurance costs** (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland \u2013 Prices).\n     * A professional and business services firm reported **health-care and business insurance premiums rising faster than revenues** (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas \u2013 Prices).\n     * **Liability insurance rates rose sharply** over the period (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston \u2013 Prices).\n     * Insurance was a **source of continued cost pressures for most business contacts** (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia \u2013 Prices).\n     * Rising insurance costs were also cited as part of **higher business costs for community service providers** (Federal Reserve Bank of New York \u2013 Community Perspectives) and **increased operating costs for organizations** (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago \u2013 Agriculture).\n     * **Trucking insurance premiums were sharply rising** for a logistics firm (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis \u2013 Nonfinancial Services).\n\n   * **Utilities / Energy**\n     * **Utilities were cited as a source of continued cost pressures by most business contacts** (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia \u2013 Prices).\n     * Several contacts reported that **increases in utilities were contributing to price pressures or price increases** (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis \u2013 Prices).\n     * Input costs were higher in manufacturing in part due to **higher utilities costs** (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco \u2013 Manufacturing).\n     * An upstate brewing company indicated that **energy costs were elevated** (Federal Reserve Bank of New York \u2013 Prices).\n\n   * **Health care**\n     * Input costs, **including health care**, increased during the reporting period in several District reports (aggregate Prices summary).\n     * Labor cost pressures intensified in part due to **outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses** (Labor Markets summary).\n     * Most business contacts reported **continued cost pressures from health care** (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia \u2013 Prices).\n\n   * **Technology / IT-related services**\n     * Professional and business services contacts reported **elevated costs for technology** (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland \u2013 Prices).\n     * Input costs, including **technology solutions**, increased (aggregate Prices summary).\n     * Demand for business technology services grew, while **costs for software and IT services were reported to be stable** in the First District (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston \u2013 Software and IT Services) \u2013 indicating that not all IT-related service costs were rising uniformly but technology-related inputs were cited as an area of pressure in some reports.\n\n   * **Other broad service input categories**\n     * Aggregate evidence notes that **input costs, including categories such as insurance, health care, and technology solutions, increased** during the reporting period (Prices summary).\n     * While not broken out by precise magnitude, **nonlabor input costs rose at a robust pace** (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland \u2013 Prices; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago \u2013 Prices), and services are one part of that nonlabor input bundle.\n\n2. **How these service-cost increases affected different sectors**\n\n   **a. Service sectors themselves (professional & business services, nonfinancial services, community service providers)**\n\n   * **Professional and business services**\n     * Reported **elevated costs for insurance and technology** (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland \u2013 Prices).\n     * A firm in this sector stated that **health-care and business insurance premiums were rising faster than revenues** (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas \u2013 Prices), directly squeezing margins.\n     * Overall, for services, **input prices grew more moderately than for manufacturing**, but these specific service categories (insurance, health care, technology) were key pressure points (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \u2013 Labor Markets; aggregate Prices evidence).\n\n   * **Nonfinancial services (transportation, warehousing, logistics, leisure, hospitality)**\n     * Within nonfinancial services, there was a **pickup in activity in transportation and warehousing** (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas \u2013 Nonfinancial Services), but **trucking insurance premiums were sharply rising** for logistics firms (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis \u2013 Nonfinancial Services), indicating higher input costs from insurance.\n     * Leisure and hospitality exhibited **weakness within nonfinancial services** (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas \u2013 Nonfinancial Services), while **demand for hospitality services declined further** (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco \u2013 Retail Trade and Services); although the findings do not explicitly isolate utilities or insurance for hospitality, higher \u201cbusiness expenses\u201d and \u201cgrowing labor and expense costs\u201d contributed to **decreased profits at a resort** (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis \u2013 Consumer Spending), implying broader service-cost pressures.\n     * Community service providers reported **rising business costs including insurance**, adding to financial pressures (Federal Reserve Bank of New York \u2013 Community Perspectives).\n\n   **b. Manufacturing and related industries**\n\n   * Multiple Districts report that **nonlabor input costs rose at a robust pace**, including **insurance, health care, technology solutions, energy, and utilities** (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland \u2013 Prices; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago \u2013 Prices; aggregate Prices summary).\n   * In the manufacturing context:\n       * The San Francisco District reported **higher input costs including utilities** (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco \u2013 Manufacturing).\n       * Firms also faced higher **energy costs** as part of nonlabor inputs (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago \u2013 Prices; Federal Reserve Bank of New York \u2013 Prices for the brewing company).\n       * While specific numeric magnitudes by sector are not provided, these reports indicate that **service-related costs (utilities/energy, insurance, health-related benefits, technology solutions)** were contributing components of manufacturers\u2019 overall input cost increases.\n   * Despite this, **input prices for services grew more moderately than for manufacturing**, meaning manufacturing\u2019s overall input cost inflation was higher, but part of that inflation stemmed from service-related inputs like utilities and insurance (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \u2013 Labor Markets).\n\n   **c.

Retail categories with declines or softness (by source and category)\n\n- **Consumer goods broadly (San Francisco Fed \u2013 RetailTradeandServices)**  \n  - Softening reported for **consumer goods overall**, including:  \n    - **Food products**  \n    - **Beverages**  \n    - **Clothing**  \n    - **Pet supplies**  \n  - The same source notes that **demand for more affordable goods declined further** and that **travel\u2011related retail spending was lower because of slower foot traffic** in tourist destinations.\n\n- **Electronics, home\u2011related durables, and home improvement (Dallas Fed \u2013 RetailSales)**  \n  - **Electronic and appliance stores**: saw **lower sales** during the reporting period.  \n  - **Building material and garden equipment stores**: **lower sales**.  \n  - **Furniture stores**: **lower sales**.\n\n- **Packaged snacks and some other consumer products (Atlanta Fed \u2013 Transportation)**  \n  - **Producers of packaged snack products**: reported **considerably lower sales volumes**, attributed to **softer consumer demand**.\n\n- **Overall retail environment (multiple Districts)**  \n  - Dallas: **retail sales in the Eleventh District fell** over the reporting period.  \n  - Atlanta: retailers reported **same\u2011store sales lower than year\u2011earlier levels** and expected **flat sales growth for full\u2011year 2025**.  \n  - Overall Beige Book summary: **overall consumer spending, particularly for retail goods, inched down**, and **activity in retail trade decreased somewhat** (San Francisco summary).  \n  - New York: retail firms reported **moderate declines in activity** in the retail sector, even though aggregate retail sales **edged up slightly** as conditions normalized after prior tariff volatility.\n\n2. Retail categories with gains or relative strength\n\n- **Luxury goods and premium discretionary (San Francisco Fed \u2013 RetailTradeandServices)**  \n  - **Retail sales of luxury goods**: **continued to perform well**.  \n  - **Retail sales of athletic footwear**: **continued to perform well**.  \n  - The same San Francisco passage notes that **demand for more affordable goods declined**, underscoring a tilt toward higher\u2011end offerings within some categories.\n\n- **Apparel in at least one District (New York Fed \u2013 Prices)**  \n  - A New York Fed contact reported that **apparel has been selling well**, even as the San Francisco District reported **softened clothing sales**, indicating regional variation rather than a uniform national trend.\n\n- **Restaurants and some services (Chicago Fed \u2013 Consumer Spending; Richmond Fed \u2013 Retail, Travel, and Tourism; St. Louis Fed \u2013 Consumer Spending)**  \n  - Chicago: **consumer spending increased at restaurants** in the **fast food, fast casual, and family dining** segments.  \n  - Richmond: **some retail, travel, and tourism firms reported solid revenue growth** despite broader softness.  \n  - St. Louis: **corporate clients continue to spend on travel, events, and luxury services** despite a **slight overall decline in consumer spending**.\n\n3. How this pattern reflects consumer behavior\n\nThe findings tie category performance to several specific consumer behavior patterns:\n\n- **Value seeking and trading down on many goods**  \n  - The Minneapolis Fed reports that **consumers are increasingly focused on finding value**, **looking for ways to stretch their dollars**, and **actively seeking deals**; mall tenants observe shoppers **looking for value, deals, and ways to stretch their dollars**.  \n  - This behavior coincides with **softening in consumer goods** such as food, beverages, clothing, pet supplies (San Francisco Fed) and **considerably lower volumes in packaged snacks** (Atlanta Fed), suggesting consumers are **pulling back or trading down** in everyday and discretionary goods.  \n  - Inflation is cited as a key driver: St. Louis contacts report that **inflation is eroding consumer purchasing power**, while multiple Districts (Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas) note **prices and selling prices have increased**, implying that some of the nominal revenue resilience in pockets occurs against declining or flat volumes.\n\n- **Premiumization and resilience at the higher end**  \n  - Even as many goods categories soften, **luxury goods** and **athletic footwear** are reported to **continue to perform well** (San Francisco Fed).  \n  - St. Louis notes that **corporate clients continue to spend on travel, events, and luxury services**, and Boston tourism contacts see a **widening gap in demand between luxury accommodations and budget\u2011friendly accommodations**.  \n  - The New York Fed reports a department store with **stronger store sales** and **same\u2011store sales outperforming last year**, attributing this partly to **resilience among mid\u2011to\u2011upper\u2011income consumers**.  \n  - These findings jointly indicate that while broad consumer goods volumes are soft, **higher\u2011income or less price\u2011sensitive segments are still spending on premium products and experiences**, supporting luxury retail and certain discretionary categories like athletic footwear.\n\n- **Selective pullback within experiences and travel**  \n  - Chicago reports that **leisure and hospitality sales showed softness in some travel\u2011related categories, including airlines and hotels**, and describes leisure and hospitality sales as **mixed**.  \n  - Philadelphia notes that **many consumers are looking to save money by choosing destinations closer to home for leisure trips**, while the Atlanta Fed reports that **restaurant diners are pulling back by skipping alcoholic beverages**.  \n  - At the same time, some segments of **restaurants** (fast food, fast casual, family dining) see **increased spending** (Chicago), and some **retail, travel, and tourism firms** report **solid revenue growth** (Richmond).  \n  - This indicates a **more granular rebalancing** within services: consumers are looking for **cheaper or closer options** and trimming extras (e.g., alcohol) but still spending on more affordable or value\u2011perceived experiences.\n\n- **Price\u2011driven divergence between revenues and volumes**  \n  - Richmond notes **solid revenue growth** for some retail and tourism firms even as other evidence (San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago) points to **softening volumes** in goods and certain categories like packaged snacks.  \n  - Cleveland and other Districts report that **selling prices increased modestly** and **price increases were passed through** in many cases, **mostly in mid to high\u2011end markets** (San Francisco Prices), which means **nominal sales can hold up or even grow while real (volume) demand softens**.\n\n4. Overall interpretation within the evidence\n\nWithin the period and regions covered by the cited Federal Reserve District reports:\n\n- **Gains / relative strength** are concentrated in:\n  - **Luxury goods**, **athletic footwear**, some **apparel** (NY District),  \n  - **Certain restaurant segments** (fast food, fast casual, family dining), and  \n  - **Some travel, tourism, and luxury services**, especially for higher\u2011income and corporate customers.\n\n- **Declines / softness** are prevalent in:\n  - Broad **consumer goods** (food products, beverages, clothing in at least some regions, pet supplies),  \n  - **Electronic and appliance stores**, **building material and garden equipment**, **furniture**,  \n  - **Packaged snack products** and some **travel\u2011related retail and hospitality** (airlines, hotels; travel\u2011related retail in tourist areas).\n\nThese category outcomes reflect consumers who are:\n\n- **Pulling back and seeking value** on many everyday and mid\u2011range discretionary goods, under pressure from **inflation\u2011eroded purchasing power**, and  \n- **Still willing to pay for select premium goods and experiences**, particularly among **mid\u2011 to upper\u2011income** and corporate segments, leading to **simultaneous softness in mass\u2011market volumes and resilience or growth at the high end**.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is specifically about Chicago retail: gains in computers, appliances, personal services, and discount/value-oriented stores; declines in apparel and grocery; and an interpretation about value-seeking while higher-income corridors remain strong. The agent instead provides a broad, multi-district Beige Book-style summary, mentions many unrelated categories, and even states appliances/electronics declined (opposite of expected gains). It does not clearly identify Chicago\u2019s discount/value store gains or the stated Chicago pattern (tech/personal services up, apparel/grocery down, higher-earning corridors robust).",

      "expected": "Energy sector performance varied significantly: In Atlanta (Sixth District), energy grew moderately - a positive outlier. In Dallas (Eleventh District), drilling and well completion activity was flat. Nationally, energy activity was generally down among reporting districts. The Chicago District noted higher energy prices as part of nonlabor cost increases affecting manufacturers.",
      "answer": "Energy sector performance and activities varied by Federal Reserve district as follows, based only on the cited findings:\n\n1. **Variation in energy sector performance across districts**\n\n   - **Sixth District (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta)**  \n     *Performance:*  \n     - \u201cEnergy activity in the Sixth District expanded moderately during the period described.\u201d  \n     *Related demand indicators:*  \n     -

**Tenth District (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City)**  \n     *Performance:*  \n     - \u201cTenth District oil and gas activity fell modestly.\u201d\n\n   - **Eleventh District (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)**  \n     *Performance:*  \n     - \u201cOil production in the Eleventh District was flat over the reporting period.\u201d  \n\n   - **New York District (Federal Reserve Bank of New York)**  \n     *Infrastructure constraint affecting activity:*  \n     - \u201cCapacity-constrained electricity infrastructure limited some communities' ability to build new housing developments.\u201d  \n     - \u201cContacts from the Rochester area reported that capacity-constrained electricity infrastructure prevented some communities from building new housing developments.\u201d\n\n2. **Specific energy sector\u2013related activities mentioned**\n\n   - **Oil and gas extraction and operational efficiency (Dallas District)**  \n     - \u201cCompanies in the energy sector continued to find ways to complete more wells in less time and with fewer people over the reporting period.\u201d  \n     - \u201cHead counts dipped further in the energy sector over the reporting period.\u201d (indicating ongoing activity with labor efficiency changes)\n\n   - **Pipeline projects (Dallas District)**  \n     - \u201cPipeline contacts credited favorable tax policies for their optimism about their project pipelines.\u201d  \n     - \u201cPipeline contacts were optimistic about their project pipelines.\u201d\n\n   - **Electricity demand and infrastructure (Atlanta and New York Districts)**  \n     - \u201cElectricity demand was solid overall,\u201d and particularly strong in industrial and commercial sectors (Atlanta District).  \n     - \u201cCapacity-constrained electricity infrastructure limited some communities' ability to build new housing developments\u201d and \u201cprevented some communities from building new housing developments\u201d (New York District, including Rochester area), indicating grid-capacity\u2013related constraints.\n\n   - **Data centers and related infrastructure (San Francisco, Chicago, Philadelphia Districts)**  \n     - \u201cData centers were cited as an example of facilities within private infrastructure projects that buoyed new commercial construction.\u201d (San Francisco District)  \n     - \u201cNew commercial construction remained subdued overall but was buoyed by public and private infrastructure projects such as roads and data centers, as well as the construction of health facilities.\u201d (San Francisco District)  \n     - \u201cNew commercial construction remained subdued overall but was buoyed by private infrastructure projects such as data centers and by the construction of health facilities.\u201d (San Francisco District)  \n     - \u201cDemand for data centers remained robust.\u201d (Chicago District)  \n     - \u201cNonresidential construction increased slightly as demand remained robust for data centers and health-care facilities.\u201d (Chicago District)  \n     - \u201cContacts reported continued growth in construction activity related to data centers despite overall slight declines in nonresidential construction activity.\u201d (Philadelphia District)\n\n3. **Other energy-related contextual activities and conditions**\n\n   - **Utilities costs and assistance (multiple districts)**  \n     - \u201cUtilities were cited as a source of continued cost pressures by most business contacts during the current period.\u201d (Philadelphia District)  \n     - \u201cManufacturers reported rising utilities costs.\u201d (Cleveland District)  \n     - \u201cSeveral contacts reported that increases in utilities are contributing to price pressures or price increases\u2026\u201d (St. Louis District)  \n     -

**Policy-related activity (energy-relevant, Dallas District)**  \n     - \u201cPipeline contacts credited favorable tax policies for their optimism about their project pipelines.\u201d\n\nWithin these findings, the clearest performance differences are: moderate expansion of energy activity in the Sixth District, decreases in energy and oil/gas exploration activity in the Ninth District, modest declines in oil and gas activity in the Tenth District, and flat oil production in the Eleventh District, alongside capacity-constrained electricity infrastructure in parts of the New York District. Specific activities mentioned include oil and gas well completion with higher efficiency, pipeline project development influenced by tax policy, robust electricity demand (especially industrial and commercial), construction of data centers as energy-intensive infrastructure, and responses to electricity infrastructure constraints that affect housing development.",

It also provides examples of other districts (Ninth/Tenth) where energy decreased, which is consistent with the idea that activity was generally down.\n\nHowever, it misses or fails to explicitly state the key Chicago point about higher energy prices affecting manufacturers\u2019 nonlabor costs, and it does not clearly echo the expected framing that drilling/well completion activity was flat in Dallas (it says oil production flat; well completion is discussed but not as flat). It also adds extraneous material (data centers, utilities costs, New York grid constraints) not asked for and not part of the expected answer.",

      "question": "How did banking conditions differ for consumer versus business lending across districts?",
      "expected": "In Kansas City, while expectations for 2026 were optimistic, consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately, signaling stress among households. In Chicago, business loan volumes increased modestly with greater demand from industrial and manufacturing clients and large companies. In Dallas, loan demand grew overall. St. Louis reported banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions. This suggests business lending was healthier than consumer lending.",
      "answer": "Banking conditions differed between consumer and business lending across Federal Reserve Districts along three main dimensions: loan performance/credit quality, loan demand/volumes, and lending standards/access to credit. The evidence below is district\u2011specific and separated by lending type.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Consumer lending vs. business lending by district\n\n#### Philadelphia District\n- **Consumer lending:**\n  - Consumer lending excluding auto and credit cards rose strongly; auto loans rose modestly; mortgages ticked up slightly (Philadelphia > Credit Conditions).\n  - Despite some increases in delinquencies and defaults, overall credit quality remained strong (Philadelphia > Credit Conditions).\n- **Business lending:**\n  - There was a continued strong decline in commercial and industrial lending, which largely drove a moderate overall decline in bank lending (Philadelphia > Credit Conditions).\n  - Commercial real estate loans declined modestly (Philadelphia > Credit Conditions).\n- **Contrast:** Consumer lending was growing (especially non\u2011auto/non\u2011card consumer loans), while business lending\u2014both C&I and commercial real estate\u2014was contracting.\n\n#### Kansas City District\n- **Consumer lending:**\n  - District banks indicated moderate deterioration in consumer lending (Kansas City > Community and Regional Banking).\n  - Banks expected consumer lending to continue to face challenges over the next six months, linked to decreasing disposable income (Kansas City > Community and Regional Banking).\n- **Business/commercial real estate lending:**\n  - Commercial real estate activity declined moderately over the past six months, but credit standards and access to credit for commercial real estate and construction were reportedly stable (Kansas City > Real Estate and Construction).\n  - District banks noted little to no change in credit standards across categories overall (Kansas City > Community and Regional Banking).\n- **Contrast:** Consumer lending conditions were deteriorating and expected to worsen, whereas commercial real estate lending faced weaker activity but with stable standards and access.\n\n#### Chicago District\n- **Consumer lending:**\n  - In the consumer sector, loan rates edged down, demand increased slightly, quality remained flat, and terms tightened slightly in late August and September (Chicago > Banking and Finance).\n- **Business lending:**\n  - Business loan demand decreased slightly on net (Chicago > Banking and Finance).\n  - Business loan quality declined modestly; business loan terms tightened despite lower business loan rates (Chicago > Banking and Finance).\n- **Contrast:** Consumer lending showed slightly stronger demand with stable quality and marginally tighter terms, while business lending showed weaker demand and modest deterioration in quality with tighter terms.\n\n#### New York District\n- **Consumer lending:**\n  - Consumer spending increased modestly throughout much of the District (New York > Prices).\n  - Small\u2011to\u2011medium sized banks reported that demand for consumer loans held steady (New York > Banking and Finance).\n- **Business lending:**\n  - Small\u2011to\u2011medium sized banks reported that demand for business loans sagged, leading overall loan demand to decline (New York > Banking and Finance; New York > Summary of Economic Activity).\n  - Demand for commercial mortgages held steady (New York > Banking and Finance).\n- **Contrast:** Consumer loan demand was steady against a backdrop of modestly rising consumer spending, whereas business loan demand sagged and pulled overall loan demand down; commercial mortgage demand was stable.\n\n#### Richmond District\n- **Consumer lending:**\n  - Financial institutions reported modest increases in loan delinquencies mainly within consumer loan portfolios, including mortgages and home equity loans (Richmond > Banking and Finance).\n- **Business/commercial lending:**\n  - Financial institutions reported that demand for most loan types was stable, with some noting a modest increase in demand within their commercial loan portfolio (Richmond > Banking and Finance).\n  - Commercial real estate conditions were described as \u201cmurky,\u201d with brokers voicing concern (Richmond > Real Estate and Construction).\n- **Contrast:** Consumer portfolios showed rising delinquencies, while business/commercial loan demand was at least stable to modestly improving; commercial real estate outlook was uncertain but not clearly tightening in standards.\n\n#### Dallas (Eleventh District)\n- **Consumer lending (inferred from total loan trends):**\n  - Loan demand and loan volume in the Eleventh District rose modestly over the reporting period (Dallas > Summary of Economic Activity).\n  - Credit standards and loan terms continued tightening for remaining loan types, while they eased slightly for residential real estate loans (Dallas > Financial Services).\n- **Business/commercial lending:**\n  - Loan volume and demand rose modestly overall (Dallas > Summary of Economic Activity), implying some improvement for business lending as part of the broader loan book.\n  - Loan performance for commercial real estate loans sharply improved during September (Dallas > Financial Services).\n- **Contrast:** Both consumer and business lending saw modest increases in demand/volume, but for business lending, commercial real estate performance improved sharply, while for \u201cremaining loan types\u201d (covering non\u2011residential segments), standards and terms were tightening.\n\n#### St. Louis District\n- **Consumer\u2011related credit indicators:**\n  - Community contacts reported elevated credit card delinquency rates among consumers (St. Louis > Consumer Spending).\n  - Overall credit conditions remained strong (St. Louis > Summary of Economic Activity).\n- **Business/small\u2011business lending:**\n  - A banker reported limited access to credit for smaller borrowers (St. Louis > Banking and Finance).\n  - Commercial real estate activity was mixed (St. Louis > Real Estate and Construction).\n- **Contrast:** Consumer credit card delinquencies were elevated but within a context of overall strong credit conditions, whereas small businesses faced limited access to credit and mixed commercial real estate conditions.\n\n#### Minneapolis District\n- **Consumer\u2011related indicators:**\n  - Consumer spending in the Ninth District was reported in the Summary of Economic Activity; detailed loan metrics are not specified beyond that (Minneapolis > Summary of Economic Activity).\n- **Business/commercial real estate:**\n  - Commercial real estate conditions were flat since the previous report (Minneapolis > Summary of Economic Activity).\n- **Contrast:** The findings do not specify direct consumer loan metrics (rates, delinquencies) for this district, but they do report flat business/commercial real estate conditions. A more detailed consumer vs business lending comparison is not possible from the available evidence.\n\n#### San Francisco (Twelfth District)\n- **Consumer lending indicators:**\n  - Recent reductions in interest rates started to spur additional demand for loans during the reporting period (San Francisco > Financial Institutions); the evidence does not distinguish precisely between consumer and business loans.\n  - Reports indicated some increases in loan delinquencies affecting borrowers generally (San Francisco > Community Conditions).\n- **Small\u2011business/business lending:**\n  - Reports indicated some increases in loan delinquencies associated with small businesses (San Francisco > Community Conditions).\n  - Conditions in community support organizations and small businesses weakened moderately, indicating a deterioration in their operating environment (San Francisco > Community Conditions; San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity).\n- **Contrast:** Lower rates began to spur additional loan demand in aggregate, but small businesses experienced weakening conditions and rising delinquencies. The findings do not separately quantify consumer loan conditions beyond the general increase in demand and delinquencies affecting borrowers.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Cross\u2011district pattern in consumer vs business lending conditions\n\nAcross the districts covered in the findings:\n\n- **Loan demand:**\n  - Consumer lending tended to be **stable or rising** in several districts:\n    - Philadelphia: strong rise in most consumer lending categories.\n    - Chicago: slight increase in consumer loan demand.\n    - New York: consumer loan demand held steady with modestly rising consumer spending.\n    - Dallas: overall loan demand rose modestly; lower rates spurred additional loan demand (Cleveland and San Francisco evidence, though not strictly district\u2011split by loan type).\n  - Business lending demand was more often **flat or weakening**:\n    - Philadelphia: strong decline in commercial and industrial lending.\n    - Chicago: business loan demand decreased slightly.\n    - New York: demand for business loans sagged though commercial mortgages held steady.\n    - Richmond: commercial loan demand stable to modestly higher.\n    - Dallas: overall loan demand up modestly; commercial real estate performance improved.\n    - Atlanta (Sixth District): overall loan growth flat (Atlanta > Summary of Economic Activity; Atlanta > Transportation).\n\n- **Credit quality and delinquencies:**\n  - Consumer side:\n    - Rising delinquencies concentrated in consumer portfolios:\n      - Richmond: modest increases in delinquencies mainly in consumer portfolios (mortgages, home equity loans).\n      - St. Louis: elevated credit card delinquency rates among consumers.\n      - San Francisco: some increases in loan delinquencies affecting borrowers generally.\n    - Kansas City: moderate deterioration in consumer lending, with expected further challenges.\n  - Business side:\n    - Business loan quality declined modestly in Chicago (Chicago > Banking and Finance).\n    - Some increases in loan delinquencies associated with small businesses in San Francisco (San Francisco > Community Conditions).\n    - In contrast, commercial real estate loan performance sharply improved in Dallas (Dallas > Financial Services).\n  - Overall credit quality was still characterized as strong in some districts despite these pressures:\n    - Philadelphia and St. Louis reported strong overall credit quality (Philadelphia > Credit Conditions; St. Louis > Summary of Economic Activity).\n\n- **Lending standards and access to credit:**\n  - Consumer lending:\n    - Chicago: consumer loan terms tightened slightly (Chicago > Banking and Finance).\n    - Dallas: loan terms and credit standards continued tightening for \u201cremaining loan types\u201d (Dallas > Financial Services), which include some consumer categories.\n    - Kansas City: moderate deterioration in consumer lending and expectations of continued challenges, though standards overall were described as little changed.\n  - Business lending:\n    - Chicago: business loan terms tightened even with lower rates (Chicago > Banking and Finance).\n    - Dallas: improved performance for commercial real estate, but standards tight for remaining loan types.\n    - Kansas City: for commercial real estate and construction, credit standards and access to credit were stable (Kansas City > Real Estate and Construction).\n    - St. Louis: limited access to credit for smaller borrowers (St. Louis > Banking and Finance).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summary\n\n- In **several districts (Philadelphia, Chicago, New York)**, **consumer lending conditions were comparatively stronger** than business lending, with consumer loan demand stable or rising and business/commercial demand weaker or declining.\n- **Consumer credit quality showed emerging stress**\u2014notably in delinquencies on mortgages, home equity loans, and credit cards (Richmond, St. Louis, San Francisco)\u2014even where overall credit quality remained strong (Philadelphia, St. Louis).\n- **Business lending conditions were more uneven**:\n  - Commercial and industrial lending declined notably in Philadelphia and softened in Chicago and New York.\n  - Commercial real estate conditions ranged from modest declines (Philadelphia; moderate decline in activity in Kansas City) to flat (Minneapolis) to mixed (St. Louis) and \u201cmurky\u201d (Richmond), with a notable improvement in commercial real estate loan performance in Dallas.\n  - Small businesses in St. Louis and San Francisco faced limited access to credit and weakening conditions.\n- **Lending standards/terms generally tightened** for both consumer and business loans in several districts (Chicago, Dallas), but **some easing occurred in residential real estate** (Dallas) and **standards were stable** for commercial real estate and construction in Kansas City.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer highlights four specific districts (Kansas City, Chicago, Dallas, St. Louis) and the overall conclusion that business lending was healthier than consumer lending: Kansas City consumer portfolios deteriorated; Chicago business loans increased modestly (industrial/manufacturing/large firms); Dallas loan demand grew overall; St. Louis banking activity unchanged with strong credit conditions. The agent correctly captures Kansas City consumer deterioration, Dallas overall loan demand rising, and mentions St. Louis overall credit conditions strong (and elevated consumer delinquencies). However, the agent contradicts the expected Chicago point by saying business loan demand decreased slightly, and it does not clearly state St. Louis banking activity was unchanged. The agent\u2019s overall cross-district takeaway also diverges, asserting consumer lending was comparatively stronger in several districts, rather than concluding business lending was healthier than consumer lending. It also includes many extra districts not asked for. \u0644\u0630\u0627, some key facts are present but the central comparison and Chicago detail are not aligned with the expected answer.",

      "question": "How did hiring patterns change, and what does this indicate about employer confidence?",
      "expected": "Employers showed cautious hiring behavior: More employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. Those still hiring favored temporary and part-time workers over full-time employment. In Boston, both hiring and layoffs increased modestly, indicating churn rather than net growth. Employment in IT services increased modestly with hiring in sales and technical positions - a relative bright spot. Jobseekers in Cleveland reported offers were more likely to be part-time with little or no benefits. This pattern indicates employer uncertainty and reluctance to commit to permanent workforce expansion.",
      "answer": "Hiring patterns show a cooler, more cautious labor market, and this points to tempered employer confidence focused on maintaining, not expanding, headcount.\n\n**How hiring patterns changed**\n\n1. **From expansion to replacement hiring**\n   * Most employers are now hiring primarily to replace turnover rather than to grow:\n     * \u201cMost employers hired only to replace workers, holding head counts steady over the reporting period.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco)  \n     * Contacts \u201cwere hiring to backfill positions due to normal turnover.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland)  \n     * In Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula and Montana, staffing contacts reported that hiring was \u201cpredominantly\u201d or \u201cmostly\u201d to replace vacancies rather than support expansion. (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis)  \n   * Employment is often flat on balance:\n     * Boston reported overall employment was flat, with both hiring and layoffs up only modestly. (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston)  \n     * The St. Louis District noted most contacts were neither hiring nor laying off. (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)  \n     * The New York District reported steady employment partly because firms had less need to hire for replacement, reflecting reduced turnover. (Federal Reserve Bank of New York)\n\n2. **Cooling demand and easier hiring**\n   * Hiring demand has softened or declined in several areas:\n     * A staffing firm with multiple offices saw hiring decline at the end of summer after an earlier uptick. (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis)  \n     * Surveys in the Minneapolis District found softening labor demand and declining headcount among employers. (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis)  \n     * Firms in Dallas \u201cremained cautious with hiring.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)\n   * At the same time, it has become easier to fill roles:\n     * \u201cThe number of applicants for each open position increased, and employers generally found it easier to hire.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco)  \n     * Philadelphia contacts reported they \u201cfaced little trouble hiring workers.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia)\n\n3. **Shift toward part-time and selective hiring**\n   * There is evidence of more part-time or temporary arrangements and selective hiring:\n     * Jobseeker-facing respondents in the Cleveland District observed clients were more likely than before to receive offers for part-time positions with little or no benefits. (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland)  \n     * In Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, only one in ten employers were hiring new full-time employees, with uncertainty spurring more temporary hiring. (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis)  \n     * Chicago contacts in agriculture reported that hiring was selective. (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago)\n\n4. **Slower turnover and rising or targeted layoffs**\n   * Turnover (quits and replacement hiring) has slowed:\n     * \u201cTurnover continued to slow across industries.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco)  \n     * New York reported less need to hire for replacement, implying reduced turnover. (Federal Reserve Bank of New York)\n   * Layoffs have become more visible in some regions and sectors:\n     * Boston reported layoffs became more common. (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston)  \n     * Cleveland noted that declining business activity led in some cases to layoffs and reduced labor demand. (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland)  \n     * Richmond reported firms expecting imminent layoffs due to slowing demand and \u201cright-sizing\u201d labor. (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond)  \n     * Atlanta contacts cited headcount reductions as demand slowed. (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta)\n\n5. **Sectoral and regional differences**\n   * Some sectors still show modest hiring:\n     * Employers in insurance and financial services continued to hire. (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco)  \n     * Firms in wholesale, finance, business services, and personal services saw slight-to-modest headcount increases. (Federal Reserve Bank of New York)  \n     * IT services employment increased modestly, with hiring in technical and sales roles. (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston)  \n     * Manufacturers in Cleveland reported slightly higher employment; Philadelphia reported rising full-time manufacturing employment. (Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and Philadelphia)\n   * Yet other areas face soft demand or technology-driven cuts:\n     * Professional service companies reported larger layoffs associated with adopting AI, which reduced labor needs. (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City)  \n     * Tech labor demand remained soft in the New York District. (Federal Reserve Bank of New York)\n   * Regional nuance:\n     * Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula showed healthy labor demand in manufacturing, construction, and mining but still predominantly replacement hiring and very limited new full-time hiring. (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis)  \n     * Maine and Vermont saw increased labor market slack. (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston)\n\n**What this indicates about employer confidence**\n\n1. **Cautious, near\u2011term restraint**\n   * Multiple districts explicitly describe cautious or limited hiring:\n     * \u201cFirms remained cautious with hiring over the reporting period.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)  \n     * Boston reported that, with isolated exceptions, hiring plans remained limited in the near term and that the longer-term outlook for hiring was less secure. (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston)  \n     * Atlanta reported that uncertainty around consumer demand and labor supply weighed on hiring plans. (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta)  \n   * Many firms are content to hold headcounts steady, suggesting reluctance to commit to growth.\n\n2. **Confidence focused on maintenance, not expansion**\n   * The predominance of backfilling rather than expansion hiring (San Francisco, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Montana) signals that employers are confident enough to keep operations running but not confident enough in demand to expand staffing.\n   * Increased ease of hiring and larger applicant pools (San Francisco, Philadelphia) reflect a cooler labor market rather than aggressive expansion by employers.\n\n3. **Mixed forward-looking sentiment**\n   * Some indicators show underlying optimism:\n     * Dallas financial services respondents expect increasing general business activity six months ahead. (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)  \n     * Philadelphia manufacturers are optimistic about growth and expect higher new orders over the next six months. (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia)  \n     * Cleveland professional and business services firms reported moderate demand growth and expected a similar pace going forward. (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland)\n   * However, these expectations coexist with:\n     * Softened service-sector outlooks and uncertainty as a \u201cheadwind\u201d (Dallas). (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)  \n     * Reports that the longer-term hiring outlook is \u201cless secure\u201d (Boston). (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston)  \n     * Increased or expected layoffs in some regions (Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Cleveland).\n\n4. **Wage and cost signals consistent with moderation**\n   * Wage growth is generally modest or easing:\n     * Dallas firms expect wage growth to slow compared with the prior 12 months. (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)  \n     * Minneapolis reports wage pressure easing slightly. (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis)  \n     * Philadelphia notes wage increases in line with long-run averages. (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia)  \n   * These wage trends, together with cautious hiring, align with employers managing costs carefully rather than competing aggressively for labor.\n\n**Synthesis**\n\nAcross the Federal Reserve Districts cited, hiring has shifted from broad expansion toward cautious, largely replacement-focused activity, with more part-time and temporary roles, easier recruiting, slowing turnover, and localized layoffs. This pattern indicates employers are generally maintaining operations but are wary about future demand and labor conditions, leading to restrained hiring and only selective, sector-specific expansion despite some pockets of optimism about medium-term business activity.",

The conclusion\u2014that these patterns indicate uncertainty and reluctance to commit to permanent expansion\u2014matches the expected indication about employer confidence.",
