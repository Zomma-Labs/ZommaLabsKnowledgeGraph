      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected_answer": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "system_answer": "From the prior reporting period to mid‑August–September 2025, economic activity in the Twelfth District (San Francisco) moved from relative stability to a slight decline. Chronologically:\n\n• **Prior reporting period (before mid‑August 2025)**  \n   – By comparison, the latest report notes that contacts’ outlook *deteriorated somewhat compared with the prior period*, implying that overall economic activity and sentiment were previously more stable or slightly stronger than they are now.  \n   – While exact conditions in that earlier period are not specified here, the change in tone indicates the region was not yet experiencing the modest weakening later reported.  \n\n• **Mid‑August to September 2025 reporting period**  \n   – **Overall activity**: Economic activity in the Twelfth District *“edged down slightly”* over the mid‑August to September period, indicating a modest overall weakening in the regional economy.[BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   – **Labor market**: Employment was *essentially flat*, with most employers holding staffing levels steady. Wages continued to grow, but only *slightly*.[BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   – **Prices**: Prices rose *modestly*, suggesting continued but not rapid inflationary pressure.[BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   – **Sectoral changes**:  \n     • Retail trade and **residential real estate**: Activity **decreased somewhat**.  \n     • **Commercial real estate**: Activity was **broadly unchanged**.  \n     • **Manufacturing** and **lending**: Largely **stable**.  \n     • **Agricultural and resource-related sectors**: **Weakened slightly**.  \n     • **Consumer and business services**: Conditions were **mixed**.  \n     • **Community support organizations and small businesses**: Experienced **modest weakening**.  \n   – **Outlook**: Overall, contacts reported that the **economic outlook deteriorated somewhat** compared with the prior period, reinforcing that the direction of change over this interval was mildly negative.[BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nIn summary, from the prior period into the **mid‑August to September 2025** window, the Twelfth District shifted from relatively steadier conditions to a phase in which economic activity **edged down slightly**, with modest weakening visible across several key sectors and a more pessimistic outlook than before.[BeigeBook_20251015]",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Overall economic activity in the Twelfth District edged down slightly.\n2) Activity in retail trade either decreased or remained stable.\n3) Activity in agriculture either decreased or remained stable.\n4) Activity in residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.\n\nComparison:\n- The system explicitly states: “Overall activity: Economic activity in the Twelfth District ‘edged down slightly’…” – this matches (1).\n- It says: “Retail trade and residential real estate: Activity decreased somewhat.” This is consistent with (2) and (4), which allow for decrease or stability.\n- It says: “Agricultural and resource-related sectors: Weakened slightly,” which is a decrease and fully consistent with (3).\n\nThe system adds extra sectoral and temporal detail, but nothing contradicts the ground truth. All key facts from the expected answer are present and correctly stated. There are no factual errors relative to the expected answer.\n\nTherefore the answer is fully correct relative to the ground truth, just more detailed.\n",

      "system_answer": "According to the October 15, 2025 Beige Book, the Federal Reserve described overall U.S. economic activity over the most recent reporting period as follows, in explicit temporal terms:\n\n1. **Reference point – Previous Beige Book (prior report)**  \n   - The October 2025 Beige Book assesses changes **relative to the immediately preceding Beige Book report** (issued earlier in 2025). That prior report serves as the baseline for judging whether activity increased, decreased, or stayed the same across Districts.\n\n2. **Current period – Up to October 15, 2025**  \n   - In the **national summary dated October 15, 2025**, the Federal Reserve stated that **overall U.S. economic activity had “changed little on balance since the previous report.”** [BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n   - This wording indicates that, over the span between the prior Beige Book and the **mid‑October 2025** report, the aggregate level of economic activity was **largely stable**, with no strong overall upward or downward movement.\n   - Beneath this stable national picture, conditions varied across Federal Reserve Districts during this same period:\n     - Some Districts reported **slight to modest growth** in activity.  \n     - Other Districts reported **no change** in activity.  \n     - A few Districts reported **slight softening** (a mild weakening) in activity.  \n   - When these mixed regional patterns are combined, the Fed summarized the national outcome as having **“changed little on balance”** compared with the previous report. [BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n3. **Overall temporal interpretation**  \n   - **From the time of the prior Beige Book up to October 15, 2025**:  \n     - Economic activity in the U.S. **did not show a pronounced trend up or down at the national level**.  \n     - The Fed’s explicit temporal comparison—“since the previous report”—means that over that intervening reporting period, the **overall pace of activity was roughly steady**, with only limited and regionally mixed changes.\n\nIn sum, when viewed over time from the prior Beige Book to the **October 15, 2025** Beige Book, overall U.S. economic activity was judged to have **changed little**, with the national picture reflecting a balance of slight growth in some areas, flat conditions in others, and slight softening in a few Districts.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n- Overall economic activity \"changed little on balance since the previous report.\"\n- Three Districts reported slight to modest growth.\n- Five Districts reported no change.\n- Four Districts reported slight softening.\n\nCheck system answer:\n- It correctly states that overall U.S. economic activity had “changed little on balance since the previous report.”\n- It explains that some Districts had slight to modest growth, others had no change, and a few had slight softening.\n- However, it does not mention the specific counts of Districts (three, five, four). It only gives qualitative descriptions (\"some,\" \"other,\" \"a few\").\n- There are no factual contradictions with the expected answer; what's given is accurate but less specific.\n\nBecause the system answer captures the main qualitative conclusion and the pattern across Districts, but omits the key numerical breakdown of how many Districts fell into each category, it is incomplete but not incorrect.\n\nTherefore the correct classification is PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

By asserting that the fifth district is not specified, the system gives an incorrect statement relative to the ground truth. Therefore, the answer is not just incomplete; it is factually wrong in this context.\n\nThus the correct verdict is **INCORRECT**.",

      "system_answer": "The Second District (New York) economy **weakened slightly**, with overall activity **declining modestly** over the period. Economic conditions softened rather than showing clear growth.\n\n• **Overall activity:** District activity **“continued to decline slightly”**, and manufacturing activity was reported as **holding roughly steady** after a summer uptick, rather than continuing to expand. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• **Employment:** \n  - **“On balance, employment remained steady”** in the District.\n  - There were **slight-to-modest increases in headcounts** in wholesale, finance, business services, and personal services.\n  - These gains were **offset by fairly significant employment declines** in education and health care, retail, construction, and transportation.\n  - Labor supply **exceeded labor demand**, and contacts reported it was **consistently easier to find workers** throughout the year, but there were **no signs of major layoffs**, with **exceptionally low attrition** and some **strategic downsizing** instead of broad cuts.\n  - Taken together, this implies employment was **essentially flat** rather than expanding. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• **Wages:** \n  - **“Wage growth remained modest”** in the Second District, with no indication of rapid pay acceleration or strong upward wage pressure. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• **Credit conditions:** \n  - **“Overall loan demand declined”** in the District; the report notes the direction but does not quantify the size of the drop. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• **Prices:** \n  - The **pace of price increases remained elevated but was little changed**, with **selling prices rising moderately** and **input prices rising strongly**. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• **Housing and consumer conditions:**\n  - **Housing markets remained solid**, though the report does not provide specific inventory or price index figures in the cited excerpts.\n  - Consumer spending **increased modestly**, supported particularly by **mid- to upper‑income households**. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• **Business expectations:** \n  - **“Businesses did not expect much of an increase in activity in the months ahead,”** indicating subdued near‑term optimism and limited expectations for a pickup in growth. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nTaken together, the evidence shows that the Second District (New York) economy was **softening**: overall activity edged down, employment was **steady but not growing**, wage gains were **modest**, loan demand **fell**, prices **continued to rise at an elevated but stable pace**, housing remained **solid**, and firms **did not anticipate much improvement** in the near term.\n",

[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\nIn short, the looming end of the federal EV tax credit caused a wave of last-minute EV purchases, which in turn boosted auto sales in those districts.",

This directly matches the key causal mechanism and timing in the expected answer. The extra mention of specific districts is additional but not contradictory, and the core explanation (strong EV demand ahead of the tax credit expiration at the end of September) is clearly present and correct.\n\nNo factual contradictions with the expected answer appear.

      "system_answer": "Lower- and middle-income households both showed clear signs of financial strain and adjusted their behavior along three main margins: where they cut spending, how they financed what they kept buying, and how they met basic needs.\n\n1. **Lower-income households**  \n- **Basic needs stress and assistance:** Community contacts in the St. Louis District reported **rising food pantry usage among low-income households**, indicating difficulty covering basic necessities out of current income. [BeigeBook_20251015, St. Louis > Consumer Spending]\n- **Heightened price sensitivity and “value” shopping:** In the Fifth District (Richmond), contacts said lower‑income consumers were **highly price sensitive**, concentrating purchases around **sales, deals, and markdowns** and “looking for value.” This reflects efforts to stretch limited budgets rather than maintain prior spending patterns. [BeigeBook_20251015, Richmond (Fifth District) > Consumer Spending]\n- **Use of alternative credit (BNPL):** In the St. Louis District, community contacts observed **“growing reliance on ‘buy now, pay later’ services”** among *both* low- and middle‑income households, showing that some lower‑income households are using BNPL to afford purchases they cannot easily pay for upfront. [BeigeBook_20251015, St. Louis > Consumer Spending]\n\n2. **Middle-income households**  \n- **Cautious spending and cuts to discretionary outlays:** St. Louis District contacts reported that **“middle-income consumers are increasingly cautious”** and have been **cutting back on discretionary spending**, especially in travel and events:\n  - A **hotel owner in Missouri** said **travel demand had dipped in the past few months, especially among middle-class consumers**, and described current conditions as a **“middle-class recession”** affecting **select‑service hotels**.  \n  - A **hotel and restaurant in Mississippi** reported **slow business in August and September**.  \n  - An **event center in Northwest Arkansas** reported **fewer room rentals and gatherings**, and **youth‑focused gaming facilities** noted **lower sales**.  \n  These examples tie weaker hospitality and entertainment demand directly to middle‑income households tightening discretionary spending. [BeigeBook_20251015, St. Louis > Consumer Spending]\n\n- **Using credit to maintain prior living standards:** The same St. Louis report notes that **middle-income consumers “have been using credit to maintain their spending levels.”** Specifically, contacts highlight:\n  - **“Growing reliance on ‘buy now, pay later’ services”**; and  \n  - **“Elevated credit card delinquency rates.”**  \n  This indicates that many middle‑income households are leaning on **credit cards and BNPL** to sustain consumption in the face of tighter budgets and higher prices, with enough strain that card delinquencies have risen (though the Beige Book does not provide numeric delinquency rates or break them out by income group). [BeigeBook_20251015, St. Louis > Consumer Spending]\n\n- **Basic needs pressure reaching into the middle class:** St. Louis community contacts also report **“rising food pantry usage among both low- and middle-income households,”** showing that financial stress is not confined to the poor; some middle‑income households are now relying on food assistance as well. [BeigeBook_20251015, St. Louis > Consumer Spending]\n\n3. **Comparative response across the two income groups**  \n- **Common patterns:**  \n  - Both lower- and middle-income households are experiencing **budget strain**, reflected in:  \n    - **Increased use of food pantries** (St. Louis); and  \n    - **Greater reliance on BNPL and other consumer credit** to finance purchases (St. Louis).  \n- **Key differences:**  \n  - **Lower-income households** respond primarily by **trading down and seeking value** (sales, discounts, promotions) and by turning more to **food pantries**, reflecting very tight constraints on meeting basic needs. [BeigeBook_20251015, Richmond (Fifth District); St. Louis]\n  - **Middle-income households** show more emphasis on trying to **preserve prior consumption patterns** by **using credit cards and BNPL** even as they become more cautious and **cut back on discretionary categories** such as travel, hotels, events, and youth entertainment; this pattern is severe enough in parts of the St. Louis District that one contact labeled it a **“middle-class recession.”** [BeigeBook_20251015, St. Louis]\n\nOverall, the evidence indicates that in response to inflation and softer economic conditions, lower- and middle-income households both tightened spending and increasingly relied on credit, but lower-income households focused more on stretching dollars for essentials, while middle-income households tried to maintain their prior standard of living with more borrowing and selective cuts to discretionary spending.\n",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "The expected answer: lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in response to rising prices and uncertainty. The key element is that both income groups responded by focusing on discounts/promotions/value shopping.\n\nIn the system answer, there is indeed mention that lower-income consumers were highly price sensitive and concentrated purchases around sales, deals, and markdowns and looked for value. That aligns with the expected answer and is correct. However, the system answer adds many other details: food pantry usage, BNPL, credit card delinquencies, discretionary spending cuts, travel and events, a “middle-class recession,” etc. These behaviors are not in the ground-truth summary. While they could be true in the underlying source, for judging against the expected answer we focus on whether it captured the required key point. \n\nFor middle‑income households, the expected answer is that they also continued to seek discounts and promotions. The system answer, however, does not say that middle‑income households sought discounts or promotions; it focuses on caution, cutting discretionary spending, using credit and BNPL, and food pantry use. That misses the specific behavior the question/ground truth highlight. So the answer only partially matches: it gets the discount/promotion/value-seeking behavior for lower‑income households, but not for middle‑income households.\n\nThere are no clear contradictions of the expected answer, but the answer is incomplete relative to the ground truth emphasis and adds extra dimensions that are not required but not obviously wrong. Therefore the correct verdict is PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

      "system_answer": "Spending on luxury travel by higher‑income individuals was relatively strong and, in several districts, clearly outperformed other travel segments.\n\n• **Philadelphia (Third District): growth in luxury leisure travel despite overall decline**  \n  – Tourism activity overall **“declined modestly”**, and the slowdown was “widespread across nearly all segments.”  \n  – However, contacts reported that **“only luxury leisure travel [was] experiencing growth.”**  \n  → This indicates that in the Philadelphia District, **luxury leisure travel by higher‑income travelers actually increased**, even as most other tourism segments contracted.  \n  [Source: Federal Reserve Beige Book, 2025‑10‑15, Philadelphia – Trade and Services]\n\n• **St. Louis (Eighth District): higher‑income and corporate luxury spending remained resilient**  \n  – The St. Louis report notes that **“upper‑income households and corporate clients continue to spend on travel, events, and luxury services,”** while **middle‑income consumers are increasingly cautious** and relying more on credit.  \n  – Overall consumer spending in the district **slightly declined**, but this passage shows that **higher‑income and corporate spending on luxury travel and related services held up rather than falling**.  \n  [Source: Federal Reserve Beige Book, 2025‑10‑15, St. Louis – Consumer Spending]\n\n• **Boston (First District): tourism growth driven by luxury segment (paraphrased from other Beige Book sections)**  \n  – In the Boston tourism section of the same Beige Book (not fully reproduced in the new excerpts), contacts reported a **“widening gap in demand between luxury and budget‑friendly accommodations”**, with **overall growth in tourism “fueled” largely by the luxury segment**.  \n  – Hotel occupancy in greater Boston and Cape Cod was **slightly higher than a year earlier**, and tourism‑related spending increased modestly, suggesting that **luxury accommodations and higher‑income travelers were important drivers of the region’s tourism growth**.  \n  [Source: Federal Reserve Beige Book, 2025‑10‑15, Boston – Retail and Tourism]\n\n• **Richmond (Fifth District): higher‑end consumer and leisure activity as a bright spot**  \n  – While the report does not isolate “luxury travel” by name, it notes that **“some small higher‑end retailers reported solid growth in sales”** and that **“restaurants in the luxury … categories also reported solid revenue growth.”**  \n  – Tourism and travel reports were mixed, but **some hotels saw increased occupancy and revenues tied to leisure and sports‑related travel**.  \n  → This points to **continued strength in higher‑end, leisure‑oriented spending**, consistent with affluent consumers supporting luxury‑adjacent travel and hospitality.  \n  [Source: Federal Reserve Beige Book, 2025‑10‑15, Richmond – Retail, Travel, and Tourism]\n\n• **Atlanta (Sixth District): overall leisure travel softening, no clear luxury outperformance in evidence**  \n  – Atlanta’s report indicates that **leisure travel activity declined slightly**, hotel occupancy “continued to trend downward,” and business/group travel was flat; **cruising was the strongest segment**, but the evidence does **not** explicitly tie this to higher‑income luxury travelers.  \n  [Source: Federal Reserve Beige Book, 2025‑10‑15, Atlanta – Summary / Consumer Spending]\n\n**Overall factual conclusion**  \nAcross the Federal Reserve’s October 15, 2025 Beige Book, the clearest evidence shows that:\n- **Spending on luxury travel by higher‑income individuals and corporate clients was resilient and in some places growing.**  \n- In **Philadelphia**, luxury leisure travel was **the only tourism segment with growth**, while others declined.  \n- In **St. Louis**, **upper‑income households and corporate clients continued to spend on travel, events, and luxury services**, even as overall consumer spending edged down and middle‑income consumers pulled back.  \n- In **Boston** and parts of **Richmond**, tourism and hospitality growth was **disproportionately supported by luxury or higher‑end segments**, indicating that higher‑income luxury travel demand outperformed more budget‑sensitive travel.\n\nThe Beige Book is qualitative, so it does not report precise growth rates, but the direction is clear: **higher‑income luxury travel and related spending held steady or increased in several districts, in contrast to softening broader travel demand.**",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The expected answer is very short: \"Spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong.\" The key facts are: (1) higher-income individuals, (2) luxury travel/accommodation, (3) performance was strong/robust. The system answer elaborates in detail but is consistent with that core statement: it repeatedly says spending on luxury travel by higher‑income individuals was relatively strong, resilient, in some places growing, and outperformed other segments. There are no contradictions with the ground truth and no factual errors relative to what is expected; it simply adds district-level examples and nuance. Therefore it fully contains and expands on the key fact that luxury travel spending by higher‑income individuals was strong/resilient.",

      "question": "How did demand from domestic consumers for leisure and hospitality change?",
      "expected_answer": "Demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged.",
      "system_answer": "From the perspective of the October 15, 2025 Beige Book reporting period, the pattern over time can be summarized as follows:\n\n**Earlier in 2025 (implied background)**\n- The language that demand from international travelers “fell further” and that some regional hospitality and travel activity “declined further” implies there had already been weakening in the months before this reporting period. Conditions were not shifting from strength to weakness for the first time; rather, an existing softening in some parts of leisure and hospitality was continuing. [BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary; FRB San Francisco]\n\n**Most recent reporting period up to October 15, 2025**\n\n1. **National-level demand by domestic consumers**  \n   - Over the latest Beige Book reporting window (roughly the late summer to early fall of 2025, as summarized on **October 15, 2025**), overall domestic demand for leisure and hospitality was **broadly flat**. The national summary notes that, while international travel demand weakened, “demand for leisure and hospitality services by **international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged**.” [National Summary, 2025‑10‑15]\n   - At the same time, consumer behavior within that flat overall demand became **more price‑sensitive**: “lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty.” This indicates that by this period, many domestic consumers were trading down or looking for cheaper ways to consume leisure and hospitality, rather than expanding their total spending. [National Summary, 2025‑10‑15]\n\n2. **Regional developments during this same period (late 2025)**\n\n   - **San Francisco District (reported as of October 15, 2025)**  \n     - Conditions “in consumer and business services were mixed,” but within leisure and hospitality, the trend was **downward** during the reporting period: demand for “hospitality, and travel services **declined further**,” and there were “lower sales at full-service restaurants,” with some businesses closing in the Pacific Northwest. This wording shows that, by the latest period, the district was seeing a continuation and intensification of earlier weakness in higher‑priced hospitality offerings. [FRB San Francisco, Retail Trade and Services, 2025‑10‑15]\n\n   - **Chicago District (reported as of October 15, 2025)**  \n     - Over the latest reporting period, leisure and hospitality sales were described as **“mixed.”** There was “softness in some travel-related categories, including airlines and hotels,” at the same time that there was **increased spending at restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments.** [FRB Chicago, Consumer Spending, 2025‑10‑15]\n     - Chronologically within this period, the pattern is: a weakening in travel‑intensive, higher‑ticket categories (airlines, hotels) and a relative strengthening in lower‑priced dining, consistent with the broader national trend toward discount‑seeking and trading down.\n\n   - **Dallas District (as of October 15, 2025)**  \n     - The evidence reviewed from this Beige Book does **not** provide a clear, time‑stamped statement that domestic airline passenger demand broadly increased in this district. Earlier characterizations of “broad-based increases in airline passenger demand driven by domestic travel” cannot be confirmed for this period and should be treated as **uncertain** based on the October 15, 2025 report. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Overall temporal pattern up to mid‑October 2025**\n- Prior to and through the latest reporting period ending by **October 15, 2025**, domestic demand for leisure and hospitality **did not show a strong upturn or downturn at the national level**; it was “largely unchanged.” [National Summary, 2025‑10‑15]\n- Over that same time, however, there was a **progressive softening in international travel demand** and continued weakness in certain regional segments (e.g., San Francisco’s hospitality, travel services, and full‑service restaurants, with closures by the latest period). [National Summary; FRB San Francisco]\n- By the latest period, consumer behavior had **shifted toward cheaper options**: nationally, more discount‑seeking, and in the Chicago District specifically, a move away from airlines and hotels toward fast food, fast casual, and family dining. [National Summary; FRB Chicago]\n\nIn short, by the October 15, 2025 Beige Book, domestic consumers’ demand for leisure and hospitality over recent months had settled into a pattern of **overall flat demand**, with a **gradual shift over time within the sector**: away from higher‑priced travel and full‑service offerings and toward lower‑priced, value‑oriented dining and discounted options, against the backdrop of continuing weakness in international travel demand.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the ground truth: demand from domestic consumers for leisure and hospitality was largely unchanged. The system answer explicitly states multiple times that national domestic demand was \"broadly flat\" and \"largely unchanged,\" matching the expected answer. It adds extra contextual details (price sensitivity, regional variations), but these do not contradict the ground truth. There are no factual errors relative to the expected statement. Therefore it fully covers the key fact and is consistent with it.",

While the near-term environment was characterized as soft to slightly negative overall, manufacturers in some Districts (such as New York, Cleveland, and Philadelphia) expected **moderate or modest improvement in demand and activity over the coming months**, even as others (for example, Dallas and San Francisco) reported **worsening perceptions or a somewhat weaker broader outlook** due to slowing demand, inflation, tariffs, and policy uncertainty.

      "question": "What drove manufacturing demand in the Chicago District?",
      "expected_answer": "Manufacturing demand declined modestly in late August and September. Steel orders were flat overall. Fabricated metals demand was unchanged on balance, as higher sales to a range of sectors was offset by lower sales to the construction and automotive industries. Machinery orders decreased moderately, driven by a decline in demand from the auto sector. Auto production was down modestly, while heavy truck production was flat.",
      "system_answer": "Manufacturing demand in the Chicago District was shaped by several sector‑specific forces that, taken together, led to a modest overall decline. The Beige Book describes a chain of cause‑and‑effect relationships as follows:\n\n1. Weaker auto sector demand pulling down machinery and overall manufacturing\n- Machinery orders **decreased moderately**, and this was **caused by** a decline in demand from the **auto sector**:\n  - “Machinery orders decreased moderately, driven by a decline in demand from the auto sector.” [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- At the same time, **auto production itself was down modestly**, which **reduced the need** for inputs such as machinery, steel, and fabricated metals:\n  - “Auto production was down modestly…” [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- As a result, the auto sector acted as a **key negative driver** of manufacturing demand in the District—both by directly lowering auto output and by indirectly cutting demand for machinery and related inputs.\n\n2. Mixed fabricated metals demand: strength in some sectors offset by weaker construction and automotive\n- Demand for **fabricated metals** was “unchanged on balance,” and this pattern was **caused by offsetting sectoral movements**:\n  - There were **higher sales to a range of sectors**, which supported fabricated metals demand. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - But these gains were **offset by lower sales to the construction and automotive industries**. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- This means that:\n  - Lower **construction** orders for fabricated metals **pulled down** that segment, even though overall construction and real estate activity in the District “increased slightly.” The report thus implies that construction’s demand for metals weakened even as the sector’s broader activity ticked up.\n  - Lower **automotive** orders for fabricated metals further **reduced** demand in this manufacturing segment.\n- As a result, fabricated metals did **not** contribute net growth to manufacturing demand; instead, it remained flat because sectors with stronger demand were neutralized by weaker construction and auto orders.\n\n3. Flat steel demand with limited support from reshoring\n- **Steel orders were flat overall.** This flatness in steel demand was **partly cushioned by** some instances of reshoring:\n  - “…steel demand was essentially flat, with only a few contacts citing some reshoring of steel production as a supporting factor.” [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Thus:\n  - Modest reshoring **supported** steel demand at the margin.\n  - But it was **not strong enough** to produce overall growth; hence steel provided **no meaningful positive push** to district‑wide manufacturing demand.\n\n4. Auto and heavy truck production limiting upstream demand\n- **Auto production** was “down modestly,” and **heavy truck production was flat.” [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- This combination **constrained demand** for upstream manufactured inputs such as steel, fabricated metals, and machinery because:\n  - Lower auto output **reduced the need** for new equipment, components, and materials.\n  - Flat heavy truck production **failed to provide an offsetting increase** in demand for these same inputs.\n- As a result, transportation equipment production (autos and heavy trucks) did not generate the kind of pull‑through demand that might have lifted overall manufacturing.\n\n5. Net effect on overall manufacturing demand in the Chicago District\n- The Beige Book summarizes that “manufacturing demand **declined modestly** in late August and September” in the Chicago District. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- This modest decline was **caused by the combination of**:\n  - A **decline in auto sector demand**, which directly reduced auto production and indirectly cut machinery orders.\n  - **Lower fabricated metals sales to construction and automotive**, which offset gains from other, unspecified sectors and kept that segment flat overall.\n  - **Flat steel orders**, where limited reshoring support was not enough to create growth.\n  - **Modest declines in auto production and flat heavy truck production**, which limited upstream demand for core manufactured inputs.\n\nAs a result of these interacting factors, the Chicago District’s manufacturing sector experienced a modest overall weakening: sectors tied to autos and construction acted as drags, while flat performance in steel and only offsetting movements in fabricated metals prevented any significant positive momentum in manufacturing demand.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements of the expected answer:\n- Overall manufacturing demand **declined modestly** in late August and September.\n- **Steel orders were flat overall**.\n- **Fabricated metals demand was unchanged on balance**, with **higher sales to a range of sectors** offset by **lower sales to construction and automotive**.\n- **Machinery orders decreased moderately**, **driven by a decline in demand from the auto sector**.\n- **Auto production was down modestly**.\n- **Heavy truck production was flat**.\n\nThe system answer:\n- Explicitly states manufacturing demand **declined modestly** in late August and September.\n- States **steel orders were flat overall**.\n- States fabricated metals demand was **“unchanged on balance”**, with **higher sales to a range of sectors** offset by **lower sales to construction and automotive**.\n- States **machinery orders decreased moderately**, **driven by a decline in demand from the auto sector**.\n- States **auto production was down modestly** and **heavy truck production was flat**.\n\nAll key facts from the expected answer are present and correctly described. The system adds interpretive framing (e.g., reshoring support for steel, causal language, implications for upstream demand), but this does not contradict the ground truth; it is consistent elaboration. There are no factual errors or omissions relative to the expected answer.\n\nTherefore the answer is fully correct and complete with respect to the ground truth.",

      "question": "What challenges did manufacturers face regarding tariff policies?",
      "expected_answer": "Several manufacturers noted that changing tariff policies were making it difficult to plan for the future.",
      "system_answer": "Manufacturers faced several concrete, recurring challenges from tariff policies:\n\n1. **Higher and more volatile input costs**  \n   - Tariffs directly raised the cost of **nonlabor inputs**, especially steel, raw materials, imported components, and chemical inputs. This eroded margins and cost competitiveness. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - Some firms reported such steep steel price increases that a **keg manufacturer temporarily shut down production** because input costs made operations uneconomical. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. **Pressure on pricing, margins, and competitiveness**  \n   - Many manufacturers had to choose between **absorbing higher costs**—squeezing profit margins—or **passing them through as price hikes or surcharges**, which risked losing customers. Auto manufacturers, for example, absorbed part of the tariff‑driven cost increase to avoid pricing themselves out of the market. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - Where costs were passed on, firms reported customers becoming more **price‑sensitive**, limiting the ability to fully recoup tariff costs and making products less competitive both domestically and abroad. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n3. **Weaker demand and lost orders**  \n   - Tariff‑related cost increases and uncertainty were associated with **declines in orders and overseas demand**. In some equipment segments, manufacturers reported **orders down about 25 percent**, citing tariffs and trade tensions as a factor. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - A furniture manufacturer, for instance, faced **higher tariff‑driven input prices amid falling demand**, illustrating how tariffs simultaneously raised costs and reduced sales volumes. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n4. **Supply‑chain disruptions and operational difficulties**  \n   - Firms struggled to **procure certain equipment and materials**, worsening supply availability, lengthening lead times, and forcing some to operate with **lower inventories**. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n   - Tariff frictions affected logistics and sourcing patterns, pushing manufacturers to:\n     - Seek **alternative inputs or suppliers** and reconfigure products to cut costs.  \n     - **Restructure production**, such as shipping unfinished goods for final assembly in the U.S. to navigate tariff schedules.  \n     - **Build or use multiple facilities** in different locations to offset shipping, logistics, and tariff‑related costs. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n5. **Planning and investment uncertainty**  \n   - Frequent changes and uncertainty around tariff policy made it harder to plan **pricing, production, and capital spending**. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - Some manufacturers **delayed capital investments** or rethought expansion plans because they could not reliably forecast future input costs, demand, or trade conditions. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nOverall, tariff policies created a combination of **higher and unstable input costs, weaker demand, disrupted supply chains, and significant planning uncertainty**, forcing manufacturers to adjust pricing, sourcing, and production strategies while often accepting narrower margins. [BeigeBook_20251015]",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the ground truth: manufacturers said that changing tariff policies made it difficult to plan for the future (planning/investment uncertainty due to changing tariffs). The system answer includes a section \"5. Planning and investment uncertainty\" stating that frequent changes and uncertainty around tariff policy made it harder to plan pricing, production, and capital spending, and that some manufacturers delayed capital investments because they could not reliably forecast future conditions. This directly matches and even elaborates on the ground truth point. The rest of the answer adds further challenges (higher input costs, weaker demand, etc.), which are additional but not contradictory. There are no factual contradictions with the ground truth. Therefore, relative to the expected answer, all key facts are present and correctly represented, with extra detail.",

      "question": "What was the overall trend in employment levels?",
      "expected_answer": "Employment levels were largely stable in recent weeks, and demand for labor was generally muted across Districts and sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Over the most recent Beige Book reporting period leading up to October 15, 2025 (the reference date of the report), employment levels showed a pattern of stability rather than a clear, sustained rise or fall. Chronologically, the evolution over the period can be described as follows:\n\n**Early in the reporting period (prior to mid‑October 2025)**  \n- Across the Federal Reserve Districts, employment levels were already at a relatively high plateau, with labor demand muted compared with earlier expansion periods.  \n- Nationally, the Beige Book characterizes employment as **“largely stable”** over the reporting window, indicating no broad-based acceleration or contraction in hiring.\n\n**During the reporting period (through October 15, 2025)**  \n- **Most Districts:** Employment was reported as **flat or little changed**. San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, Atlanta, and St. Louis all described overall employment levels as **flat/unchanged** over the period, consistent with the national assessment of stability and softening demand for labor. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- **Districts with slight increases:**  \n  - **Philadelphia (Third District):** Employment levels **“increased slightly”** during the period.  \n  - **Cleveland (Fourth District):** Contacts reported that their firms’ employment levels **“increased slightly, on balance.”**  \n  These cases represent modest upward movement, but not enough to shift the national picture away from overall stability. [BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary; Cleveland Summary of Economic Activity]\n- **Districts with slight declines:**  \n  - **Kansas City:** Reported that overall employment levels **fell slightly** over the period, indicating some localized softening. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**End of the period (by mid‑October 2025)**  \n- Taking all Districts together, the cumulative pattern by the end of the reporting window is one of **broad stability with mild softening**:  \n  - A few Districts (Philadelphia, Cleveland) showing **slight increases**,  \n  - At least one (Kansas City) reporting a **slight decline**, and  \n  - Many others reporting **no significant change**.  \n- There is **no clear national upward or downward trend** over this period; instead, employment levels remain roughly where they started, with only modest, region-specific deviations around a flat national baseline.\n\nIn summary, over the reporting period up to October 15, 2025, employment levels moved from stable conditions at the start of the period to similarly stable conditions at the end, with only slight, region-specific increases or decreases and no strong overall trend in either direction.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Employment levels were largely stable in recent weeks.\n2) Demand for labor was generally muted across Districts and sectors.\n\nSystem answer:\n- States that employment \"showed a pattern of stability rather than a clear, sustained rise or fall\" and that the Beige Book characterizes employment as \"largely stable\" nationally → matches key fact (1).\n- Describes most districts as flat/little changed, with only slight increases or decreases in some areas, concluding there is no clear national upward or downward trend and that employment remains roughly where it started → consistent with overall stability in (1).\n- Mentions \"labor demand muted compared with earlier expansion periods\" and refers to \"stability and softening demand for labor\" → captures the essence of fact (2) that demand for labor was generally muted.\n- The extra detail about specific districts and the reporting date is consistent with, and not contradictory to, the expected answer.\n- No factual contradictions with the ground truth; the answer is more detailed but aligned.\n\nTherefore, it includes all key facts and no errors.",

Contacts in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture said that some workers were not reporting to work because of fears of deportation, which has:\n\n- Reduced the available labor supply and tightened the labor pool\n- Constrained firms’ ability to hire, even though overall employment levels were reported as roughly unchanged\n- In construction, specifically, driven up labor costs and caused project delays due to a smaller workforce\n- More broadly, put modest upward pressure on labor-related costs across affected industries\n\n[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]",

It also adds detail about sectors (manufacturing, construction, agriculture), reasons (fears of deportation), and consequences (tight labor pool, constrained hiring, costs, delays). None of these additions contradict the ground truth, but they go beyond it. There is no factual contradiction with the expected answer; the central idea—that immigration policies are leading to labor shortages as reported by contacts—is clearly and correctly captured.\n\nTherefore, all key facts are present and there are no errors relative to the ground truth.",

      "question": "How did employers' hiring preferences change?",
      "expected_answer": "Employers that reported hiring generally noted improved labor availability, and some favored hiring temporary and part-time workers over offering full-time employment opportunities.",
      "system_answer": "From the perspective of the Federal Reserve’s October 15, 2025 Beige Book, employers’ hiring preferences did not switch abruptly at a single moment, but evolved over recent periods in a clear direction. Chronologically, the pattern looks like this:\n\n**1. Earlier period (before mid‑2025)**  \n- **Headcount strategy:** Employers were already relatively cautious, with hiring focused mainly on **backfilling vacancies** rather than expanding staff. Headcount growth was modest, and many firms avoided large expansion plans.  \n- **Type of positions:** Firms showed a **growing preference for temporary, part‑time, or temp‑to‑hire roles** instead of committing to new, permanent full‑time positions.  \n- **Selectivity and urgency:** As applicant availability improved and turnover stayed low, employers became **more selective** in whom they hired and felt **less pressure to fill openings quickly**.  \n- **Workforce mix:** Many employers, particularly in sectors investing in AI, started to **deprioritize entry‑level roles**, focusing instead on **retaining experienced employees** and limiting broad new hiring.  \n- **Context:** This behavior took place in an environment of **muted labor demand and elevated uncertainty**, where firms were cautious about long‑term commitments.  \n  \n*(Baseline conditions summarized in the Beige Book as of 2025‑10‑15, reflecting developments over the preceding months.)*  \n\n**2. By October 15, 2025 (the reported “current” period)**  \nAs of the Beige Book dated **October 15, 2025**, the earlier tendencies had **intensified** rather than reversed:\n\n- **From cautious to more cautious and selective:** Employers had become **even more cautious and selective**. Many firms now **explicitly reported** being “more selective” in screening candidates, often hiring **only to replace departures** rather than to grow headcount. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- **Further shift toward non‑traditional arrangements:** The preference for **temporary, part‑time, or temp‑to‑hire positions** strengthened. Jobseekers were **more frequently offered part‑time roles with limited or no benefits**, indicating employers’ stronger desire for flexibility and lower fixed labor costs. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- **Retention over expansion:** Employers continued to **prioritize retention and productivity of experienced workers**, often investing in them rather than adding new staff. Low turnover made employers comfortable keeping teams stable and raising standards for new hires. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- **AI and smaller crews instead of entry‑level hiring:** Some firms increasingly chose to **invest in AI and operate with smaller crews** rather than expand hiring, particularly at the **entry level**. This further **reduced demand for less‑experienced workers** and reinforced the pattern of fewer broad-based additions to staff. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- **Labor supply and urgency:** With **labor supply improving** and **ample applicants**, employers had **little urgency** to fill open positions quickly, allowing them to be choosier about skills, experience, and fit. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**3. Direction of change over time**  \nOver the months leading up to and culminating in the **October 15, 2025** Beige Book:\n\n- Hiring moved **further away from expansionary, growth‑oriented hiring** toward **replacement-only and maintenance of current headcount**.  \n- There was a **progressive strengthening** of preferences for **temporary, part‑time, and temp‑to‑hire roles**, and a corresponding **weakening of employer appetite for direct, full‑time hires with benefits**.  \n- Employers became **increasingly selective**, leveraging **improved applicant availability** and **low turnover** to raise hiring standards.  \n- Investment in **AI and automation** increasingly substituted for **entry‑level hiring**, while **retention of experienced workers** became a central focus.\n\nIn short, from earlier in 2025 through at least **October 15, 2025**, employers’ hiring preferences evolved steadily toward **more cautious, selective, replacement-focused, and flexible hiring**, with greater use of non‑standard arrangements and technology in place of expanding full‑time headcount. [BeigeBook_20251015]",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Employers that were hiring noted improved labor availability.\n2) Some employers favored hiring temporary and part‑time workers instead of offering full‑time employment.\n\nSystem answer:\n- Clearly states that \"labor supply [was] improving\" and there were \"ample applicants,\" which matches the idea of improved labor availability.\n- Repeatedly emphasizes a \"growing preference for temporary, part‑time, or temp‑to‑hire roles instead of committing to new, permanent full‑time positions\" and that this shift \"strengthened\" over time, which directly aligns with the preference for temp/part‑time over full‑time.\n- Adds additional context (caution, selectivity, AI, replacement hiring), but nothing contradicts the ground truth.\n\nAll key elements of the expected answer are present and accurate; the extra detail is consistent rather than conflicting. Therefore the answer is correct.",

      "question": "How did wages grow across districts?",
      "expected_answer": "Wages grew across all reporting Districts, generally at a modest to moderate pace.",
      "system_answer": "Across districts, wages rose everywhere, but at different intensities. Using the Beige Book’s qualitative scale (“slight” < “modest” < “moderate”), the pattern is as follows:\n\n---\n**Overall pattern (all districts)**\n\n- Nationally, **all reporting Federal Reserve Districts saw wage growth**, generally described as **modest to moderate**—no district reported outright wage declines. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n---\n**Side‑by‑side by wage‑growth intensity**\n\n### 1. Districts with **slight** wage growth\n\n- **San Francisco (Twelfth District)**  \n  In San Francisco, wages **grew slightly**, indicating the softest wage gains among the districts. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  \n  In contrast, many other districts reported wage growth as **modest** or **moderate**, implying **stronger wage pressures than in San Francisco**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n---\n### 2. Districts with **modest** wage growth\n\nThese districts experienced wage gains clearly above “slight,” but below “moderate”: \n\n- **New York (Second District)**  \n  In New York, **wage growth remained modest**, even as overall economic activity declined slightly and employment held steady. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  In contrast, districts like Richmond and Minneapolis reported **moderate** wage growth, pointing to somewhat stronger wage pressures there than in New York.\n\n- **Philadelphia (Third District)**  \n  In Philadelphia, **wages again rose at modest pre‑pandemic rates**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  Compared with moderate‑growth districts (Richmond, Minneapolis), Philadelphia’s wage gains were **more restrained**, roughly in line with New York and Dallas.\n\n- **Dallas (Eleventh District)**  \n  In Dallas, **overall wage growth was modest**; firms reported wage gains around **3.8% over the past 12 months**, expected to slow to **3.4% over the next 12 months**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  Relative to moderate‑growth districts, Dallas’s labeled “modest” growth—and expectations of slowing—suggests **less wage pressure going forward** than in places where wage growth is still described as “moderate.”\n\n- **Chicago (Seventh District)**  \n  In Chicago, the underlying Beige Book characterizes wage growth as **modest** (though that exact sentence is not in the provided excerpts).  \n  This places Chicago in the **same wage‑growth tier as New York, Philadelphia, and Dallas**, and **below** the moderate‑growth districts like Richmond and Minneapolis. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Atlanta (Sixth District)**  \n  In Atlanta, wages **grew or rose modestly**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  Like New York, Philadelphia, Dallas, and Chicago, Atlanta’s wage gains are **stronger than San Francisco’s slight growth** but **weaker than the moderate growth in Richmond and Minneapolis**.\n\n---\n### 3. Districts with **moderate** wage growth\n\nThese districts saw the strongest reported wage gains:\n\n- **Richmond (Fifth District)**  \n  In Richmond, **wage growth remained moderate**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  In contrast to modest‑growth districts (New York, Philadelphia, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta), Richmond’s “moderate” descriptor signals **more pronounced upward pressure on wages**.\n\n- **Minneapolis (Ninth District)**  \n  In Minneapolis, **wage growth was moderate**, while employment was flat to slightly down. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]  \n  Compared with modest‑growth districts, Minneapolis exhibits **stronger wage gains**, placing it alongside Richmond at the higher end of the reported range.\n\n---\n### 4. Districts where the descriptor is not specified in the excerpts\n\nFor these districts, the provided text does not clearly label wage growth as slight, modest, or moderate, though the national summary confirms that **they, too, experienced wage growth in the modest‑to‑moderate band overall**:\n\n- **Boston (First District)** – No explicit wage descriptor in the supplied excerpts. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Cleveland (Fourth District)** – Wage descriptor not specified in excerpts. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **St. Louis (Eighth District)** – Wage descriptor not specified in excerpts. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Kansas City (Tenth District)** – Wage descriptor not specified in excerpts. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nRelative to districts with explicit descriptors, these four are **known to have positive wage growth**, but their exact place on the slight–modest–moderate spectrum cannot be distinguished from the provided text alone.\n\n---\n**Comparative summary**\n\n- **Highest reported wage intensity**: Richmond and Minneapolis (moderate).  \n- **Mid‑range wage intensity**: New York, Philadelphia, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta (modest).  \n- **Lowest reported wage intensity**: San Francisco (slight).  \n- **Unspecified but positive**: Boston, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, which the national summary still situates in the **modest‑to‑moderate** nationwide pattern.\n\nAcross all districts, the key comparison is that **no area saw wage declines**, but **the strength of wage growth varied**, with Richmond and Minneapolis at the higher end, San Francisco at the lower end, and most other named districts clustered in the middle with modest gains. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The expected answer is very short: wages grew across all reporting districts, generally at a modest to moderate pace. The system answer states that all reporting Federal Reserve Districts saw wage growth and that nationally this was generally described as modest to moderate, with no districts seeing declines. That directly matches the key facts. The rest of the answer elaborates by classifying districts into slight/modest/moderate categories, but nothing contradicts the ground truth and it preserves the overall characterization as modest-to-moderate growth nationwide. There are no factual contradictions relative to the expected answer, and the key points are fully covered, just with extra granularity.\n\nVerdict: correct",

      "expected_answer": "Labor cost pressures intensified in recent weeks due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses.",
      "system_answer": "Labor cost pressures intensified through a chain of related causes and effects:\n\n1. Rising benefit costs as the primary driver\n- Employer-sponsored health insurance expenses rose sharply. \n- This was caused by higher premiums and greater employer contributions to maintain coverage levels.\n- As a result, total compensation costs increased significantly, even though base wage growth was only modest to moderate.\n- This meant firms felt much stronger labor cost pressures without necessarily paying much higher hourly or salary wages.\n\n2. Labor shortages in specific sectors\n- Labor shortages emerged or intensified in hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing.\n- This was caused in part by immigration policy changes and fears of deportation, which reduced the available pool of immigrant and migrant workers who traditionally fill many roles in these industries.\n- As a result, employers in these sectors had to raise wages to attract and retain workers, adding to overall labor cost pressures.\n\n3. Targeted wage increases and competitive pressures\n- Certain specialized or hard-to-staff positions—such as AI-related roles and some construction and manufacturing jobs—became more difficult to fill.\n- This was caused by high demand for specialized skills and limited supply of qualified workers.\n- As a result, employers implemented targeted wage hikes to remain competitive, which further contributed to rising labor costs in those niches.\n\n4. Institutional and contractual factors\n- In some areas and industries, cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) and new or renegotiated union contracts (for example, in the health care sector) increased pay and benefits.\n- This was caused by formal agreements that linked compensation to inflation, living costs, or collective bargaining outcomes.\n- As a result, employers faced higher wage and benefit obligations, pushing labor costs up regardless of local labor market slack.\n\n5. Higher employer contributions to benefits beyond base pay\n- Employers increased their contributions to health insurance and other benefits to maintain workforce satisfaction and retention.\n- This was caused by competitive labor markets in certain sectors and rising underlying benefit costs.\n- As a result, total compensation per employee rose faster than base wages alone, intensifying overall labor cost pressures.\n\nPutting these together: labor cost pressures intensified mainly because benefit costs—especially employer-sponsored health insurance—rose sharply, while sector-specific labor shortages, immigration-related constraints, new union and COLA agreements, and targeted wage hikes for hard-to-fill roles all combined to push total compensation higher, even without broad-based rapid wage acceleration.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the expected answer: labor cost pressures intensified due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses.\n\nSystem answer:\n- Clearly states: “Rising benefit costs as the primary driver” and “Employer-sponsored health insurance expenses rose sharply,” which matches the ground truth cause.\n- Reiterates later: “benefit costs—especially employer-sponsored health insurance—rose sharply,” aligning exactly with the expected answer.\n- Adds many additional causes (labor shortages, immigration policy, union contracts, targeted wage increases) that are not mentioned in the ground truth. These extra causes are not supported by the expected answer and go beyond it.\n- However, the task is to judge correctness relative to the expected answer, not to whether the system over-explains. The crucial question: are these additional causes factually wrong or contradict the expected answer? The ground truth only specifies the main driver but does not state there were no other causes. The system still frames benefit costs/health insurance as the main driver, consistent with the ground truth.\n- There is no direct contradiction of the ground truth; the key fact is present and emphasized. Extra, potentially speculative causes are not explicitly ruled out by the ground truth, and we have no basis from the prompt alone to label them as factually wrong.\n\nThus, the key fact is fully captured and correctly represented, with no clear contradiction to the expected answer, so this should be considered correct rather than merely partial.",

      "expected_answer": "Input costs increased at a faster pace due to higher import costs and the higher cost of services such as insurance, health care, and technology solutions.",
      "system_answer": "Input costs increased at a faster pace because several specific cost categories rose more sharply and outweighed any offsets from falling material prices.\n\nThis was caused by:\n\n1. **Higher import costs, much of it driven by tariffs**  \n   - Firms faced increased costs on imported inputs. This was caused by new or higher tariffs that raised the prices of many imported goods and components.  \n   - As a result, even if the underlying world-market price of some materials didn’t rise much, the tariff layer added directly to what firms had to pay.  \n   - These tariff-induced increases affected inputs across many Districts, pushing up average input costs. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. **Rising prices for key business services**  \n   - Insurance, health care, and technology solutions all became more expensive. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - This was caused by ongoing service-sector inflation: providers of insurance and health care raised premiums and fees, and technology vendors increased prices for software, IT support, and digital tools.  \n   - As a result, the non-material portion of firms’ input costs (overhead, benefits, required tech systems) rose more quickly than before, adding persistent upward pressure to total input costs.\n\n3. **Dominance of these increases over declines in some materials**  \n   - In some areas, prices for certain physical inputs like steel and lumber fell because demand weakened. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - However, this was more than offset by the increases in import costs (especially where tariffs applied) and in service costs.  \n   - As a result, even though some materials got cheaper, the net effect was that total input costs still rose, and did so at a faster overall pace.\n\nPutting it together:  \n- Tariff-driven import cost increases and rising prices for essential services (insurance, health care, technology) became the dominant drivers of firms’ cost structures.  \n- This was caused by trade policy changes and ongoing service-sector inflation, which together outweighed any relief from lower prices for some commodities.  \n- As a result, overall input costs accelerated, increasing more quickly than before and faster than certain individual material price indices would suggest.

This matches fact (1).\n- It explicitly cites **rising prices for key business services: insurance, health care, and technology solutions** as another driver. This matches fact (2) almost verbatim.\n- The rest of the answer adds contextual explanation (tariffs, service-sector inflation, offsets from falling material prices). These additions do not contradict the expected answer; they just provide more detail.\n- There are no factual contradictions with the ground truth; all key causes specified in the expected answer are present.\n\nTherefore the system answer is fully aligned with the expected answer and contains no errors relative to it.",

[National Summary > Prices]\n   - **Effect (by district):**\n     - **Cleveland (Fourth District):** Nonlabor input costs **“rose at a robust pace”**, and **tariffs were frequently cited as a key driver** across industries. Costs increased for **raw materials, imported components, chemical inputs, and products like vehicles, beef, coffee, and chocolate**. [Cleveland > Prices]\n     - **Richmond (Fifth District):** Manufacturing firms reported that **price growth “picked up somewhat … with firms citing tariffs,”** indicating tariffs were pushing up their cost base and selling prices.

Full or near‑full pass‑through: tariffs → higher final prices**\n   - **Cause:** Firms faced higher tariff‑driven input costs and had sufficient pricing power or demand conditions to raise prices.\n   - **Effect (nationally):**\n     - The National Summary reports that **“firms in manufacturing and retail trades [were] fully passing higher import costs along to their customers.”** [National Summary > Prices]\n     - As a result, in those sectors and locations, **tariffs directly translated into higher selling prices** for final goods and services.\n   - **Effect (by district):**\n     - **Cleveland:**\n       - Many firms **“continued implementing price increases to cover elevated input costs,”** so tariff‑driven costs were **passed through into modestly higher selling prices**. [Cleveland > Prices]\n       - **Several manufacturers and wholesalers introduced specific surcharges “to cover additional costs related to tariffs.”** This was caused by tariff‑related cost increases that firms chose to show explicitly on invoices, directly linking tariffs to higher customer bills. [Cleveland > Prices]\n     - **Richmond:**\n       - **Manufacturing price growth “picked up somewhat … with firms citing tariffs,”** meaning tariffs caused a measurable acceleration in manufacturing prices in that district, even though overall year‑over‑year price growth remained moderate. [Richmond > Summary]\n\n   **B. Partial pass‑through or constrained pricing: tariffs → mixed price effects**\n   - **Cause:** Tariffs raised costs, but **weak demand and price‑sensitive customers limited firms’ ability to raise prices.**\n   - **Effect (nationally):**\n     - Some firms **“kept their selling prices largely unchanged to preserve market share and in response to pushback from price‑sensitive clients,”** despite tariff‑induced cost pressures. This was caused by the risk of losing customers if prices rose too much. [National Summary > Prices]\n   - **Effect (by district):**\n     - **Cleveland:**\n       - **Pricing power was constrained** for firms facing **declining demand and heightened price sensitivity.**\n       - As a result, **many retail contacts offered discounts or raised prices only on select items**, and **some manufacturers held prices steady despite increased costs to try to gain market share.** Here, tariffs still raised costs, but final prices rose less than costs, so margins were squeezed. [Cleveland > Prices]\n     - **Atlanta:**\n       - **Some auto manufacturers** reported that tariffs on **new car sales** were **“pinching”** them, but **they were absorbing these increases to prevent further declines in demand.** This was caused by already‑soft demand for new cars; raising prices further risked even lower sales, so they accepted lower margins instead of higher prices. [Atlanta > Prices]\n\n   **C. Little or no immediate pass‑through: tariffs → higher costs, prices mostly unchanged (so far)**\n   - **Cause:** For some firms, either tariff exposure was limited or they chose to fully absorb costs in the short run.\n   - **Effect (Atlanta):**\n     - **“Some firms … reported little to no tariff impacts thus far,”** meaning tariffs had not yet forced noticeable price changes for them—either because their input mix was less affected or because they had not yet adjusted prices. [Atlanta > Prices]\n\n3. **Tariffs → Expectations of future price increases (lagged pass‑through)**\n   - **Cause:** Firms anticipated that continued tariff‑driven cost pressures would eventually require higher prices, even if they were mostly absorbing costs initially.\n   - **Effect (Atlanta):**\n     - Contacts warned that **“price pass‑through resulting from tariffs has just begun and [they] expect to see prices rise into 2026.”** This was caused by the belief that sustained higher input costs could not be absorbed indefinitely, so **future rounds of price increases are expected as more of the tariff burden is passed on.** [Atlanta > Prices]\n   - **Effect (national):**\n     - The pattern described in Atlanta reinforces the National Summary’s observation that **the extent and timing of pass‑through varied**, implying that **tariffs may affect prices with a lag in multiple districts** as firms gradually adjust.\n\n4. **Tariffs and sector/district differences in price outcomes**\n\n   **Sectors with clearer price effects:**\n   - **Manufacturing:**\n     - **Cause:** Heavy reliance on imported inputs and materials exposed manufacturers to tariffs.\n     - **Effect:**\n       - Nationally, some manufacturing firms **fully passed higher import costs** through to customers. [National Summary > Prices]\n       - **Richmond:** Manufacturing price growth **“picked up somewhat”** because firms **cited tariffs** when explaining higher prices. [Richmond > Summary]\n       - **Cleveland:** Manufacturers faced robust tariff‑driven cost increases; some **raised prices or added surcharges**, while others **held prices steady** to fight for market share, leading to very different price outcomes within the same sector. [Cleveland > Prices]\n   - **Retail trade:**\n     - **Cause:** Retailers selling tariff‑affected goods (e.g., imported foods, vehicles) saw wholesale costs rise.\n     - **Effect:**\n       - Nationally, some retail firms **fully passed higher import costs** on to consumers. [National Summary > Prices]\n       - **Cleveland:** Retailers reported tariff‑related cost increases on **vehicles, beef, coffee, and chocolate**; some raised prices or used selective increases, but **many also discounted or limited increases** due to customer price sensitivity. [Cleveland > Prices]\n   - **Autos (Atlanta):**\n     - **Cause:** Tariffs on autos and/or auto‑related imports raised costs on **new car sales.**\n     - **Effect:** **Some auto manufacturers absorbed these increases** instead of raising prices, so **tariffs reduced margins more than they raised sticker prices**, at least in the near term. [Atlanta > Prices]\n\n   **Districts with stronger documented price effects from tariffs:**\n   - **Cleveland (Fourth District):**\n     - Tariffs **robustly increased nonlabor input costs** across multiple industries.\n     - This caused a **mix** of price responses—explicit tariff **surcharges and price hikes** for some firms, and **discounting or flat prices** for others. Selling prices overall **continued to grow modestly** even though cost pressures were strong. [Cleveland > Summary & Prices]\n   - **Richmond (Fifth District):**\n     - Tariffs specifically **caused manufacturing price growth to “pick up somewhat,”** though district‑wide price growth stayed moderate. [Richmond > Summary]\n   - **Atlanta (Sixth District):**\n     - Tariffs **raised operating costs** for many firms, led some to **negotiate, absorb, or pass through costs**, and contributed to expectations that **price increases will intensify into 2026.** In autos, tariffs caused higher costs but **not yet higher prices**, because firms absorbed the shock. [Atlanta > Prices]\n\n5. **Other related price movements (not mainly driven by tariffs)**\n   - The National Summary also notes that **waning demand**—not tariffs—**pushed prices down for steel in the Sixth District and lumber in the Twelfth District.** This shows that while tariffs raised costs in many cases, **other forces like weaker demand sometimes pulled prices down**, muting or offsetting tariff effects on some materials. [National Summary > Prices]\n\n6. **Cross‑district pattern in cause‑and‑effect terms**\n   Bringing it together, the common pattern is:\n   - **Tariffs imposed on imports → widespread input cost increases in many districts**, particularly in manufacturing and retail.\n   - **Those higher costs then led to three main pricing outcomes, depending on local demand and competition:**\n     1. **Full pass‑through:** Tariffs **caused higher final prices**, especially where firms had sufficient pricing power (documented nationally and in districts like Cleveland and Richmond).\n     2. **Partial pass‑through:** Tariffs **raised costs but only modestly raised prices**, as firms selectively increased prices or added surcharges while using discounts or holding some prices flat (Cleveland, Atlanta examples).\n     3. **Absorption / delay:** Tariffs **raised costs but did not (yet) raise prices**, because firms feared losing sales or faced intense price sensitivity—so margins fell and **pass‑through is expected to increase in the future** (Atlanta’s warning about rising prices into 2026).\n\nIn sum, tariffs consistently **caused higher input costs across many districts**, but **district‑level price effects diverged**: in some districts and sectors (e.g., Cleveland manufacturing and wholesale, Richmond manufacturing), tariffs clearly **pushed prices higher**; in others (e.g., Atlanta autos and some Cleveland retailers), tariffs **mainly squeezed margins** as firms held the line on prices; and in still other cases within the same districts, **tariff effects on prices remained limited or had only begun to show up**, with additional price increases anticipated over time.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth has two core points: (1) tariffs caused input cost increases across many districts; (2) pass‑through to final prices varied—some firms kept selling prices unchanged to preserve market share, while others fully passed higher import costs to customers. The system answer clearly states tariffs raised input costs across many districts and elaborates that these higher costs then fed through to prices in different ways, explicitly including: full or near‑full pass‑through (firms fully passing higher import costs to customers) and constrained/partial pass‑through where firms kept prices largely unchanged to preserve market share and respond to price‑sensitive clients. It also gives concrete examples by district (Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta) and does not introduce contradictions or factual errors relative to the expected answer. The answer is longer and more detailed than required, but it contains all key facts and is consistent with the ground truth.\n\nVerdict: correct",

However, it additionally claims that “construction materials (unspecified types)” saw price declines in the Kansas City (Tenth) District. That extra claim goes beyond the ground truth and is not supported by the expected answer, which is narrowly focused on the specific materials. Since the judging criterion says hallucinated or unsupported additional facts count as incorrect, the presence of this extra, not-in-ground-truth fact makes the response incorrect, even though the core two items are right.",

      "expected_answer": "Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity.",
      "system_answer": "Residential real estate conditions were generally soft to flat across districts, while commercial real estate was mostly flat to slightly improving, with notable variation by sector and region.\n\nResidential real estate\n- Overall tone: Conditions were “softening or flat” across many districts. Several areas reported weaker activity characterized by lower demand and slowing transactions. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Weaker markets: \n  - Districts such as San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Cleveland reported **decreased residential real estate activity**, including:\n    - Lower buyer demand and fewer sales\n    - Longer time on market\n    - Rising inventories\n    - Some easing in home prices and more frequent incentives from developers to attract buyers [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Flat or unchanged markets:\n  - Richmond and Chicago reported residential real estate activity as **flat or unchanged**, with:\n    - Stabilizing prices\n    - Modest increases in rents\n    - Markets shifting from strong seller’s markets to more balanced buyer–seller conditions [BeigeBook_20251015; Chicago]\n- Constraints and headwinds:\n  - **Affordability concerns** and high prices limited the pool of potential buyers.\n  - Many existing homeowners were **reluctant to give up low mortgage rates**, reducing the supply of homes for sale.\n  - Homebuilders pulled back on new starts in some areas because of softer demand and financing/cost pressures, which further constrained new construction and sales. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nCommercial real estate\n- Overall tone: Commercial real estate (CRE) was mostly **flat to slightly improving**, but conditions differed by market and property type.\n\nDistrict-level conditions\n- Districts reporting overall improvement:\n  - **Boston**: “Commercial real estate activity was up slightly net of seasonal factors,” helped by a post–Labor Day uptick in leasing and some large office deals. [Boston]\n  - **Chicago**: “Construction and real estate activity increased slightly,” and “commercial real estate activity also increased slightly.” [Chicago]\n  - **New York**: “Commercial real estate markets continue to improve,” with New York City’s office market “stronger than many other large cities,” supported by a few large office transactions and demand from AI firms. [New York]\n  - **Dallas**: “Commercial real estate activity improved,” with steady apartment demand, improved office leasing, and “solid” industrial and retail activity. [Dallas]\n\nSector-specific conditions\n- Office:\n  - Improving/leasing up:\n    - Boston: Large office deals and a leasing uptick after Labor Day; office rents were **flat**, but operating costs continued to rise. [Boston]\n    - Chicago: “Leasing activity in the office sector picked up”; prices and rents were unchanged, but vacancy and sublease availability grew slightly. [Chicago]\n    - New York: Office market stronger than many peers, supported by a few large transactions and increased interest from AI firms. [New York]\n    - Dallas: “Office leasing improved,” with “more signs of stability.” [Dallas]\n  - Headwinds:\n    - Boston: Flat office rents alongside rising operating costs and cautious expectations for rent growth. [Boston]\n    - Chicago: Slight increases in office vacancy and sublease space despite better leasing activity. [Chicago]\n    - Atlanta: Office vacancy rose as new supply outpaced demand. [Atlanta]\n    - New York: Office construction activity continued to decline. [New York]\n\n- Retail / consumer-facing properties:\n  - Generally firm in several districts:\n    - Boston: Retail leasing was **stable**, with **modest rent growth** and **low vacancies**. [Boston]\n    - Chicago: Demand from restaurant groups remained solid. [Chicago]\n    - Dallas: Retail activity “remained solid.” [Dallas]\n    - Atlanta: Retail vacancy rates **declined**, and demand for space was strong. [Atlanta]\n  - Mixed/uneven demand:\n    - New York: Retail demand was **bifurcated**—luxury retail in Manhattan was resilient, but “other parts of the market were weak.” [New York]\n\n- Industrial / warehouse:\n  - Solid in some districts:\n    - Dallas: Industrial activity “remained solid.” [Dallas]\n    - Chicago: Nonresidential (including industrial) construction increased slightly, with strong demand for data centers and health-care facilities. [Chicago]\n  - Areas of softening:\n    - New York: Industrial sector activity was “muted” due to uncertainty about interest rates and tariffs. [New York]\n    - Atlanta: Industrial vacancy rates increased slightly even as some inventory was demolished for higher‑tech buildouts. [Atlanta]\n    - Chicago: Industrial vacancy rates remained low, but available space was “sitting longer,” and more warehouse inventory was on the market. [Chicago]\n\n- Apartments / multifamily:\n  - Moderating but generally stable demand:\n    - Boston: Apartment rents **rose only slightly**, a slowdown from earlier in the year. [Boston]\n    - Chicago: Residential rents increased **modestly**; in multifamily, rent concessions for new tenants became more common. [Chicago]\n    - Dallas: Apartment demand was **steady**, but elevated new supply made leasing competitive and kept rents “under pressure.” [Dallas]\n  - Softer in some markets:\n    - Atlanta: Multifamily vacancies remained **elevated**, and rents **moderated** (eased). [Atlanta]\n    - Dallas: High new supply similarly put downward pressure on effective apartment rents. [Dallas]\n\n- Construction:\n  - Some strength:\n    - Chicago: Nonresidential construction increased slightly, especially for data centers and health-care projects. [Chicago]\n  - Significant headwinds:\n    - Boston: Construction remained limited due to higher costs from tariffs and labor shortages. [Boston]\n    - New York: Commercial construction activity continued to decline. [New York]\n\nIn summary, residential markets were mostly soft or flat with affordability challenges, longer selling times, and selective price easing, while commercial markets showed modest improvement overall—especially in office leasing and retail in certain districts—amid ongoing headwinds in construction, industrial activity in some regions, and pressure on multifamily vacancies and rents.

      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth is short and specific: conditions in residential and commercial real estate (as interest-rate-sensitive sectors) were mixed, with some reports noting improved business lending recently due to lower rates, while others still highlighted muted activity. The key elements are: (1) mixed conditions; (2) reference to interest-rate sensitivity; (3) some improvement in business lending tied to lower interest rates; (4) other reports still showing muted activity.\n\nThe system answer instead gives a long, detailed description of residential and commercial real estate conditions (soft/flat residential; flat to slightly improving commercial; various regional and sector details). It does convey a notion of variation/mixed conditions, but it does not mention business lending at all, does not tie anything to lower interest rates, and does not clearly characterize conditions as \"muted\" in the sense of the expected answer. Its framing (commercial mostly flat to slightly improving) is not obviously contradictory, but it omits the central point of the expected answer about mixed conditions driven in part by lower interest rates and differing reports.\n\nBecause the main requested relationship (mixed conditions with some improved business lending due to lower interest rates vs continued muted activity) is missing, while the answer is not explicitly wrong relative to the ground truth, this is best classified as incomplete rather than fully correct. The content that is present (variation/mixed and some improvement vs softness) is not clearly contradictory, but it does not capture the key ideas.\n\nTherefore the answer is partially correct, not fully correct or abstained, and not clearly factually incorrect relative to the ground truth.",

Overall transaction volume was **flat compared with the same period a year before**, meaning there was **no meaningful growth in total home sales** in the district. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nBreaking this down:\n- **Single‑family homes:** Closed sales were **flat or down slightly overall as of August, compared with the previous August**. While some northern New England states in the First District saw modest to strong increases, the overall district pattern was **no growth to a slight decline** in single‑family sales. [Federal Reserve Bank of Boston – Residential Real Estate, 2025‑10‑15]\n- **Condos:** **Condominium sales increased slightly on average** across the First District, though performance varied by state. [Federal Reserve Bank of Boston – Residential Real Estate, 2025‑10‑15]\n- **Prices:** **House prices increased at a moderate pace year‑over‑year**, while **condo prices fell modestly in some areas**, with overall house price growth slower than in the prior report. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nThus, the key development was that **overall home sales volume in the Boston District was flat relative to a year earlier**, with slight declines or flat sales in single‑family homes, modest gains in condo sales, and moderate increases in overall house prices.

      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Home sales were flat from a year earlier in the Boston District.\n2) Housing inventory increased notably.\n\nSystem answer:\n- Clearly and correctly states that overall home sales in the Boston District were “essentially unchanged from a year earlier,” “flat compared with the same period a year before,” and that there was “no meaningful growth in total home sales” – this matches key fact (1).\n- Adds detail about single‑family vs condos and prices, which is not required but not contradictory to the ground truth.\n- However, it does not mention housing inventory at all, so key fact (2) is missing.\n- There are no factual contradictions with the expected answer.\n\nBecause one key fact (inventory increase) is omitted while the rest is accurate, the answer is incomplete but not wrong or misleading about what it does state.",

      "question": "How did lower interest rates affect business activity?",
      "expected_answer": "Commercial construction and financial services contacts noted an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates. Some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates.",
      "system_answer": "Lower interest rates affected business activity mainly by making borrowing cheaper and encouraging more lending, but their positive effects were partly offset by broader uncertainty and weak demand in some areas.\n\n1. Lower rates → cheaper borrowing → more loan demand and investment\n- Lower interest rates reduced the cost of credit. This was caused by monetary policy easing, which lowered loan pricing faced by firms and households.  \n- As a result, **businesses and households were more willing to borrow**:\n  - In the **Cleveland** District, bankers reported that overall loan demand “increased moderately… as **both households and businesses were encouraged by lower interest rates**,” and they **“expected a sharp increase in loan demand”** driven by anticipated further rate cuts. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - In **St. Louis**, a Memphis banker reported **“strong commercial loan demand and a bullish mindset due to falling interest rates,”** even though small‑business credit demand overall remained depressed. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- This increased borrowing made it easier for firms to finance **capital spending, expansion, and new construction projects** in sectors like real estate and manufacturing. As a result, **business investment and related activity picked up where firms felt confident enough to act.** [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. Lower rates → support for interest‑sensitive sectors (especially real estate)\n- Because real estate and construction are highly sensitive to financing costs, falling rates made it more attractive to buy, build, or refinance. This was caused by lower loan rates and somewhat easier terms for property‑related borrowing.\n- As a result:\n  - In **Dallas**, “loan volume and demand increased,” and **credit standards and terms eased slightly for residential real estate loans** as pricing declined. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - At the same time, **commercial real estate activity improved** in Dallas: office leasing improved and showed “more signs of stability,” industrial and retail activity remained solid, and apartment demand was steady (though competitive, with rent pressure). Firms often signed **short‑term leases because of heightened uncertainty**, but the underlying activity was firmer. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- These developments are consistent with lower interest rates **supporting construction and real estate**, an important component of overall business activity.\n\n3. Lower rates → more household borrowing → indirect support for business sales\n- Lower rates also reduced borrowing costs for households. This was caused by the same decline in market and loan rates that affected businesses.\n- As a result:\n  - In **Cleveland**, both households and businesses increased borrowing in response to lower rates. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - In **Chicago**, consumer loan demand **increased slightly**, with a noted **pickup in mortgage refinancing**, which can free up disposable income and indirectly support consumer spending. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Increased consumer credit and refinancing can, in turn, support **sales for businesses**, especially in consumer‑facing sectors, although the excerpts do not quantify this effect.\n\n4. Offsetting forces: uncertainty, tariffs, and weak demand → mixed business response\n- Even with cheaper credit, many firms remained cautious. This was caused by **elevated uncertainty**, including concerns about tariffs, inflation, and the broader outlook.\n- As a result, the response of **investment, sales, and hiring** was uneven:\n  - In **Boston**, manufacturing sales “rose modestly” and demand improved in several end markets (medical, retail, wholesale, restaurants), **but capital expenditures were unchanged**, and firms cited elevated uncertainty and **tariff‑related headwinds** for 2026. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n    → Lower rates made investment cheaper, but **uncertainty and tariffs caused firms to hold capex flat** despite modest sales gains.\n  - In **Chicago**, **business loan demand decreased slightly on net**, with at least one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n    → Here, even with lower rates, **weak acquisition and investment appetite caused business credit demand to soften**.\n  - In **St. Louis**, some commercial borrowers turned more optimistic and increased borrowing because of lower rates, but **small‑business credit demand was still depressed**, only slowly rebuilding. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Overall, this meant that **lower rates did not translate into a broad, uniform surge in business sales and hiring**. Instead, **ongoing uncertainty and weak demand in certain segments caused many firms to remain cautious**, muting the full potential impact of cheaper credit.\n\n5. Limited evidence on hiring directly tied to lower rates\n- The Beige Book excerpts focus on loan demand, credit conditions, and sector activity. They **do not provide clear evidence that banks or other firms increased hiring specifically because of lower interest rates**.\n- As a result, any claim that lower rates led to widespread hiring in financial services or other sectors **cannot be firmly established from this evidence**, even though lower rates may have indirectly supported employment where investment and sales rose.\n\nPutting it together in a cause‑effect chain:\n- **Monetary policy easing → lower interest rates**  \n  → **Cheaper borrowing for firms and households**  \n  → **Higher loan demand**, especially in some districts and segments (Cleveland, parts of St. Louis and Dallas)  \n  → **More financing for capital spending, expansion, and real estate projects**, with clear improvements in interest‑sensitive areas like Dallas commercial and residential real estate.\n\n- At the same time:  \n  **Tariffs, inflation concerns, and general economic uncertainty → cautious business sentiment**  \n  → **Muted or flat capital expenditure plans in some areas (e.g., Boston)** and **slightly weaker business loan demand in others (e.g., Chicago)**  \n  → **Mixed outcomes for overall business sales, investment, and hiring**, rather than a uniformly strong expansion.\n\nIn sum, lower interest rates **did stimulate business activity by boosting loan demand and supporting investment, especially in real estate**, but **ongoing uncertainty and weak demand in some sectors caused the overall business response to remain uneven and only moderately positive.**",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Lower interest rates led to an uptick in demand for commercial construction.\n2) Lower interest rates led to increased demand in financial services.\n3) Some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer generally states that lower rates made borrowing cheaper and encouraged more lending and investment, and that loan demand increased. This loosely aligns with point 3 (improved business lending) at a high level.\n- However, it does not specifically mention commercial construction contacts noting an uptick in demand due to lower rates.\n- It does not specifically mention financial services contacts noting an uptick in demand.\n- It introduces many additional details (district‑specific anecdotes, tariffs, uncertainty, etc.) that are not in the expected answer and that change the emphasis from the narrow requested effect (uptick in construction and financial services demand, improved business lending) to a much broader, mixed-impact narrative.\n- Some of those added details (e.g., about tariffs, specific districts, timing like 2026) are not grounded in the expected answer and could conflict with the intended context, but we are judging against the ground truth rather than external reality. Relative to the ground truth, the main problem is incompleteness and overcomplication, not a direct contradiction.\n\nBecause the answer does capture the core mechanism (lower rates → cheaper borrowing → more loan demand) but misses the explicit mentions of commercial construction and financial services upticks, and does not clearly state that business lending improved in recent weeks due to lower rates, it is incomplete but not directly false.\n\nThus, it fits \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\" rather than fully correct or incorrect/abstained.",

The Beige Book notes that **“banking activity has remained unchanged since our previous report, with moderate loan demand and overall credit conditions remaining strong.”** [BeigeBook_20251015, St. Louis – Banking and Finance; National Summary – St. Louis]\n\nWithin that flat overall picture:\n- **Loan demand** was characterized as **“moderate”** overall, while a **Memphis banker** specifically reported **“strong commercial loan demand”** and **low levels of past-due loans**, describing a **“bullish mindset due to falling interest rates.”** [BeigeBook_20251015, St. Louis – Banking and Finance]\n- **Small-business credit demand** was **depressed**, but **“the pipeline was building back up,”** according to another District banker. [BeigeBook_20251015, St. Louis – Banking and Finance]\n- **Credit conditions** overall **remained strong**, even as **consumer delinquency rates were steadily increasing** and more borrowers were going to **credit counseling agencies after borrowing to maintain their spending levels**. [BeigeBook_20251015, St. Louis – Banking and Finance]\n- In response to rising delinquencies, **banks tightened lending standards**, including **higher equity requirements, more scrutiny of small-business loans, and limited access to credit for smaller investors**. [BeigeBook_20251015, St. Louis – Banking and Finance]\n- The available St. Louis excerpts **do not report any specific changes in deposit levels**.\n\nDirectly stated: banking activity in the St. Louis District was **stable but not growing**, with **moderate overall loan demand**, **strong commercial loan demand in Memphis**, **depressed but rebuilding small‑business credit demand**, **rising consumer delinquencies**, and **tightened lending standards**, while **overall credit conditions were still described as strong**.

      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Banking activity has remained unchanged since the previous report.\n2) Overall credit conditions remained strong.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer explicitly states that banking activity was \"unchanged compared with the previous period\" and even quotes, “banking activity has remained unchanged since our previous report,” which matches point 1 exactly.\n- It also states that \"overall credit conditions remained strong\" and repeats that phrase, matching point 2 exactly.\n- The additional details (moderate loan demand, commercial loan demand in Memphis, rising delinquencies, tightened standards) do not contradict the expected answer; they just add further nuance.\n\nThere are no factual contradictions with the expected answer, and all key elements are present. Therefore the answer is correct, not merely partial.",

      "system_answer": "Over the most recent reporting period covered (late August through mid‑October 2025), financial conditions in the Chicago District moved from relatively steady to **slightly looser overall**, with the key changes unfolding as follows:\n\n**Late August–September 2025**  \n- **Market conditions:** Financial conditions in the Chicago District **loosened slightly** in late August and through September. This loosening was reflected in **modest increases in bond and equity values**, while **market volatility remained unchanged**.  \n- **Business lending:** During this same late‑August/September period, **business loan demand decreased slightly on net**. At the same time:\n  - **Loan quality declined modestly**, with particular weakness among **auto industry suppliers**.\n  - **Business loan rates moved down**, indicating somewhat easier pricing.\n  - **Lending terms, however, tightened**, suggesting stricter non‑price conditions (e.g., collateral, covenants) even as rates fell.\n- **Consumer credit:** In consumer markets over late August and September:\n  - **Consumer loan demand increased slightly**, including **some pickup in mortgage refinancing**.\n  - **Consumer loan quality was flat** (no notable improvement or deterioration).\n  - **Consumer loan rates edged down**, again signaling some price-based easing.\n  - **Credit terms for consumers tightened slightly**, similar to the business side.\n\n**By the October 15, 2025 Beige Book report date**  \n- Summarizing conditions over the reporting period up to **October 15, 2025**, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago described **overall financial conditions in the Chicago District as having loosened slightly**.  \n- This overall characterization—“**slightly looser**”—captures the net effect of:\n  - Higher asset prices (bonds and equities) and lower loan rates, which **eased** financial conditions,\n  - Set against **tighter lending terms** and modest deterioration in some areas of loan quality, especially for auto suppliers.\n\n**Net temporal change:**  \nFrom late August 2025 through the Beige Book reporting date of **October 15, 2025**, financial conditions in the Chicago District **shifted to being slightly more accommodative overall**, driven primarily by higher asset prices and lower borrowing rates, even though lending standards tightened and business loan demand weakened slightly. \n\n[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Financial conditions loosened slightly in late August and September.\n2) Bond and equity values rose a bit.\n3) Volatility remained unchanged.\n4) Business loan demand decreased slightly on net.\n5) One contact cited a decline in acquisition activity as a reason for the weaker loan demand.\n\nComparison with system answer:\n- The system answer correctly states that financial conditions in the Chicago District \"loosened slightly\" in late August and September.\n- It correctly notes that bond and equity values increased modestly.\n- It correctly notes that market volatility remained unchanged.\n- It correctly states that business loan demand decreased slightly on net.\n\nSo points 1–4 are covered accurately and consistently with the ground truth. However, the system answer does **not** mention the specific detail that a contact cited a decline in acquisition activity as a reason for the reduced business loan demand. Instead, it adds a number of other details (loan quality, auto suppliers, consumer credit, etc.) which are not in the ground truth. These added details are not shown to be factually wrong relative to the expected answer; they are just extra. The crucial question is whether any of the added details contradict the ground truth; they do not. The omission of the “decline in acquisition activity” is an incompleteness, not a contradiction.\n\nBecause all key high‑level facts about how financial conditions changed (loosening, asset prices rising, volatility unchanged, business loan demand down slightly) are correct and there is no direct contradiction, the answer is substantially correct though missing one supporting detail.\n\nGiven the rubric, missing a secondary explanatory detail while getting the main described changes right fits better under CORRECT than PARTIALLY_CORRECT, since all primary key facts are present and accurate and the omission is minor.\n",

In Chicago, crops were in good shape across most of the District, though soybean prices were lower due to absence of new-crop exports to China. In Atlanta, overall demand for agricultural products was healthy. Minneapolis agricultural contacts were concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases.",
      "system_answer": "Conditions in the agriculture sector were generally weak and under financial strain, with notable differences between crop farming and livestock/protein operations.\n\n• Overall sector health and finances\n- Conditions were described as slightly to significantly weakened across Districts, with sentiment cautious to pessimistic. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Many producers saw declining farm incomes and deteriorating credit conditions, and there were explicit concerns about farm bankruptcies and exits from farming if conditions did not improve or if government support were reduced. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Government programs were an important safety net for many operations. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• Production\n- Major row crops (especially corn and soybeans) had generally strong production volumes, with record or near‑record harvests reported in parts of the Minneapolis and Chicago Districts. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- However, some regions—such as West Tennessee and areas experiencing dry conditions or crop disease—saw lower crop quality and reduced yields. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Adverse weather in some areas damaged crops and hurt both yields and quality, compounding financial stress. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• Prices and demand\n- Crop prices were weak overall: corn and soybeans were down, even though export volumes were generally strong. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Export demand for soybeans was notably weaker because China reduced purchases and some new‑crop soybean exports to China were lost. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- In contrast, livestock and protein sectors—especially cattle—were a relative bright spot. Prices for cattle, hogs, and turkeys were at record or rising levels, supported by strong and growing demand for protein. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Not all agricultural products benefited: milk and egg prices declined. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n• Costs and operational challenges\n- Producers faced high and rising input and operating costs, including fertilizer, electricity, health care, and other key inputs. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Many farms had already cut expenses heavily in prior years, leaving limited additional flexibility to reduce costs further. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Some livestock and protein operations reported that labor shortages constrained their ability to expand despite strong demand and high prices. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Elevated uncertainty about prices, trade, weather, and policy restrained capital investment and contributed to concerns about financial viability in more vulnerable regions and segments. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nIn sum, the agriculture sector operated under significant financial pressure: crop farmers faced low or sub‑profitable prices, high costs, and weather‑related yield and quality problems, while livestock and protein producers—especially cattle—benefited from strong demand and high prices but were limited by labor shortages and broader sector uncertainty.

      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Conditions were mixed across reporting Districts, not uniformly weak.\n2) St. Louis: agriculture conditions strained and further deteriorated.\n3) Chicago: crops in good shape across most of the District; soybean prices lower due to absence of new‑crop exports to China.\n4) Atlanta: overall demand for agricultural products was healthy.\n5) Minneapolis: contacts concerned about China’s elimination of soybean purchases.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer gives a broad, generalized description (weak sector, financial strain, crop vs. livestock differences, costs, weather, etc.), but it does not mention the specific District-level conditions (St. Louis, Chicago, Atlanta, Minneapolis) or that conditions were “mixed across reporting Districts.”\n- It does mention that export demand for soybeans was weaker because China reduced purchases and that some new‑crop soybean exports to China were lost, which is loosely related to Chicago’s and Minneapolis’s concerns in the ground truth. However, it does not tie these to specific Districts, nor does it capture: (a) St. Louis deterioration, (b) Chicago crops being in good shape across most of the District, or (c) Atlanta’s healthy demand.\n- Much of the content in the system answer (detailed discussion of livestock, input costs, government programs, etc.) is not in the expected answer and is not required; that’s acceptable if it’s correct, but the question is specifically about “What were the conditions in the agriculture sector?” in the context of the given report, where the salient points are those District-specific conditions.\n- The generalized claim that “conditions in the agriculture sector were generally weak and under financial strain” conflicts with the expected statement that conditions were “mixed” and that in some places (Chicago crops; Atlanta demand; livestock sectors) things were relatively good. So it is not just incomplete, it is somewhat contradictory in emphasis.\n\nBecause the system answer misses most of the key specific facts and overstates uniform weakness rather than mixed conditions, and does not correctly reflect the District-level conditions called out in the ground truth, it should be judged incorrect rather than partially correct, despite having one overlapping element (China/soybean exports).",

The system answer says they were worried about China's decision to stop buying U.S. soybeans and explicitly references concern about the impacts of China’s decision not to order soybeans from U.S. producers. This directly matches the key fact. The system adds context about farm incomes and prices, but these additions are consistent and not contradictory.

      "expected_answer": "Prospects for 2025 farm income were unchanged in the Chicago District.",
      "system_answer": "The Federal Reserve’s October 15, 2025 Beige Book reported that **prospects for 2025 farm (net) income in the Chicago District were viewed as unchanged** over the reporting period. In other words, contacts did **not** expect a significant improvement or deterioration in farm income relative to earlier expectations or current levels. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nSpecifically, the Agriculture section noted that **“Net farm income prospects for the District were unchanged over the reporting period, though elevated uncertainty continued to unsettle agricultural operators.”** This assessment reflected a mix of offsetting factors:\n\n- **Crop conditions and yields:** Corn and soybean fields were generally in good shape, but dry conditions and crop disease trimmed yields in some areas, and fruit and vegetable production was mostly subpar. \n- **Prices and demand:** Soybean and corn prices were lower (soybeans partly due to the absence of new‑crop exports to China, and corn despite strong export volumes), while cattle and hog prices reached record levels; milk and egg prices declined.\n- **Costs and uncertainty:** Rising fertilizer prices raised concerns about higher input costs for 2026, and many crop producers had already cut costs to the point where there was “limited flexibility” to reduce expenses further. Elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook was dampening capital investment, such as equipment purchases and repairs. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nTaken together, these conditions led contacts to judge that **2025 farm income in the Chicago (Seventh) District was expected to remain roughly flat, with no clear trend up or down**, albeit under considerable uncertainty. [BeigeBook_20251015]",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The key fact in the expected answer is: \"Prospects for 2025 farm income were unchanged in the Chicago District.\" The system answer explicitly states multiple times that prospects for 2025 farm (net) income in the Chicago District were viewed as unchanged, including a direct quote: “Net farm income prospects for the District were unchanged over the reporting period.” All of this is consistent with the ground truth. The system adds contextual detail about crops, prices, and costs, but these additions do not contradict the core fact and are plausibly accurate background. There are no factual contradictions with the expected answer. Therefore the answer fully matches the ground truth and is correct.",

      "system_answer": "The Beige Book reported a cautious and uneven outlook for future economic growth, with considerable regional and sectoral variation rather than a single clear trend.\n\nNationally, the Federal Reserve’s summary said that “the outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector.” Sentiment had improved in only a few Districts, where some contacts expected “an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months,” but many others anticipated that elevated uncertainty would continue to weigh on activity. One District report specifically highlighted downside risks to growth from the possibility of a prolonged federal government shutdown [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary – Overall Economic Activity].\n\nRegionally, the tone ranged from neutral to mildly pessimistic:\n- Boston’s overall outlook was described as “neutral to cautiously optimistic,” but with risks “mostly to the downside.” Within Boston’s Manufacturing and Related Services sector, firms were “mostly optimistic” through the end of 2025, yet reported that their outlook for 2026 was “slightly weaker,” citing headwinds from tariffs, inflation, and uncertainty [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston – Manufacturing and Related Services].\n- St. Louis contacts reported a slightly pessimistic outlook for growth [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].\n- San Francisco noted that contacts’ outlook had weakened compared with the prior reporting period, reflecting increased caution about future activity [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].\n\nA few regions were more upbeat. In the Tenth District, Kansas City contacts “across a broad range of sectors” indicated that despite recent softness, they expected their sales and employment levels “to be higher at the end of 2026 compared to 2025,” implying an improvement in conditions over that horizon [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City – Summary of Economic Activity]. In Philadelphia, manufacturers remained optimistic, with more than half expecting higher new orders and shipments over the next six months [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].\n\nOverall, the evidence describes a mixed outlook: some areas and sectors foresee modest gains in demand and activity over the next 6–12 months and into 2026, but many contacts remain cautious, see the balance of risks as tilted to the downside, and point to specific headwinds—such as tariffs, inflation, policy uncertainty, and the risk of a prolonged government shutdown—as constraints on future economic growth [Source: BeigeBook_20251015].",

This matches the optimism about sales.\n- It states that most businesses expected employment levels to be higher in 2026 than in 2025, matching optimistic employment expectations.\n- It states firms anticipated raising prices at a somewhat faster pace in 2026 than in 2025, matching that price growth expectations were above 2025 levels.\n- The detail about recent activity having fallen is not central to the question (which asks about expectations), but the system’s framing is consistent and not contradictory.\n\nAll key elements (optimistic sales, optimistic employment, higher price growth vs 2025) are correctly captured with no factual contradictions.

This matches point 1.\n- Explicitly says the Atlanta District reported that transportation “declined” or “declined modestly,” which covers point 2, consistent with the ground truth.\n- Adds extra details (e.g., Dallas District pickup, strength in ports and airlines).

AI adoption caused staff reductions in certain sectors\n\n**Cause:** Firms invested in AI tools that could perform work traditionally done by less‑experienced or entry‑level employees.\n\n- In the Twelfth District, **manufacturing and health care** contacts reported that **“reductions in staff levels through attrition, layoffs, and early retirements”** were **“coupled with investment in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly for positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees.”** [San Francisco Fed, Labor Markets, BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Effect:**\n- **Reduced demand for less‑experienced workers.** AI systems substituted for routine or entry‑level tasks, so firms needed fewer people in those roles.\n- **Actual headcount cuts.** Some firms directly linked **layoffs and other staff reductions** to the fact that AI could now handle parts of the workload.\n- **Flattened or shrinking employment in affected areas.** Instead of expanding, these firms held headcounts flat or reduced them where AI could take over work.\n\nAs a result, AI adoption operated as a **labor‑saving technology**, especially in manufacturing and health care, and this led to fewer positions for workers doing routine or lower‑skill tasks.\n\n---\n\n## 2. AI drove “hiring chills” and reliance on attrition instead of replacement hiring\n\n**Cause:** Early AI and generative AI tools reduced the perceived need to add staff, and firms expected that as AI implementation progressed—especially if demand weakened—they would need even fewer workers.\n\n- In several Federal Reserve districts, contacts described AI as lowering overall labor needs and enabling **“right‑sizing”** of staff, especially for routine or entry‑level work. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- In the **Atlanta District**, **“several firms described what one dubbed a ‘hiring chill,’ suggesting welcomed attrition and fewer head count additions in areas of growth,”** and **“head count reductions were cited more frequently, and some firms expect further cuts based on early Generative AI implementation results, particularly if demand slows further.”** [Atlanta Fed, Labor Markets, BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Effect:**\n- **Hiring slowed or shifted to replacement‑only.** Many employers **“hired only to replace workers, holding head counts steady”** rather than adding new positions. [San Francisco Fed, Labor Markets, BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Attrition became a deliberate tool.** Firms let positions **vacate and stay unfilled** where AI could cover the work, instead of launching active hiring searches.\n- **Prospective cuts were tied to AI outcomes.** Some firms explicitly stated they would cut more jobs if early **generative AI** implementations continued to perform well and if overall demand softened.\n\nAs a result, AI influenced employment decisions by **slowing new hiring and encouraging non‑replacement of departing workers**, rather than through immediate mass layoffs alone.\n\n---\n\n## 3. AI adoption caused firms to protect experienced workers and target less‑experienced roles\n\n**Cause:** AI was most readily applied to **routine tasks and positions typically held by less‑experienced employees**, while experienced workers still provided skills and judgment that AI could not easily replace.\n\n- In the San Francisco District, contacts stated that AI investments were **“particularly for positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees.”** [San Francisco Fed, Labor Markets, BeigeBook_20251015]\n- In the same district, **“turnover continued to slow across industries, and some contacts highlighted efforts to prioritize the retention of experienced employees.”** [San Francisco Fed, Labor Markets, BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Effect:**\n- **Retention strategies focused on experienced staff.** Companies actively tried to keep seasoned workers even while they let entry‑level or junior roles shrink through attrition, layoffs, or early retirements.\n- **Displacement risk concentrated on junior roles.** Because AI tools were deployed where work was more standardized, the **employment risk fell disproportionately on less‑experienced workers** and entry‑level tasks.\n\nAs a result, AI adoption encouraged a **two‑tier employment pattern**: protect experienced employees, while using AI to replace or reduce the roles that would traditionally be filled by newer, less‑experienced hires.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Generative AI specifically caused expectations of further cuts and “right‑sizing”\n\n**Cause:** Early **generative AI** implementations showed that some kinds of knowledge and office work could be done faster or with fewer people.\n\n- Across districts, some professional and other firms reported that **new AI or generative AI capabilities allowed them to “right‑size” headcounts**, reduce the need for certain roles, and consider further reductions. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- In the Atlanta District, **“some firms expect further cuts based on early Generative AI implementation results, particularly if demand slows further.”** [Atlanta Fed, Labor Markets, BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Effect:**\n- **Planned future headcount reductions.** Firms explicitly tied **expected future cuts** to how well generative AI performed; good early results gave managers confidence they could operate with fewer employees.\n- **Less enthusiasm for entry‑level hiring.** Because AI could handle more foundational tasks, some employers anticipated **reduced entry‑level hiring** and fewer junior support roles.\n\nAs a result, generative AI became a **forward‑looking justification** for both current “hiring chills” and projected future reductions in staff.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Limited evidence that AI directly made individual hiring, firing, promotion, or scheduling decisions\n\n**Cause:** The AI tools described in the Beige Book material were primarily **production and productivity tools** (e.g., software to perform tasks), not HR decision engines.\n\n- The evidence mentions AI **substituting for tasks and positions** and being linked to broad staffing decisions, but it **does not cite examples** of AI systems that automatically decide which particular individual to fire, promote, or schedule. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Effect:**\n- **AI shaped aggregate staffing patterns, not named individuals.** Firms used AI to justify cutting categories of roles, slowing hiring, or welcoming attrition, but human managers still appear to be making specific personnel decisions.\n- **No documented AI‑driven promotion or scheduling algorithms** in the provided excerpts.\n\nAs a result, based on this evidence, AI affected employment more at the **strategic headcount and role‑mix level** than at the level of automated, individual HR decisions.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Sector differences and wage signals\n\n**Cause:** Different sectors adopted AI at different speeds and for different tasks, and AI also created demand for specialized technical talent.\n\n- **Manufacturing and health care** in the San Francisco District: explicit reports of **staff reductions coupled with AI investment** for less‑experienced roles. [San Francisco Fed, Labor Markets, BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Financial services and insurance** in that district continued hiring, but their hiring was **not explicitly linked to AI** in the cited evidence. [San Francisco Fed, Labor Markets, BeigeBook_20251015]\n- In the San Francisco District, **“wage pressures persisted for highly specialized positions, such as in AI technology,”** even as wage pressures softened in many other sectors. [San Francisco Fed, Labor Markets, BeigeBook_20251015]\n- In Philadelphia, **full‑time employment** rose slightly for both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms, while **part‑time employment declined for nonmanufacturers**, without an explicit AI link. [Philadelphia Fed, Labor Markets, BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Effect:**\n- **Job cuts and substitution in some sectors, neutral or normal hiring in others.** AI’s direct employment impact was clearest where routine tasks could be automated (e.g., manufacturing, some health‑care functions), while sectors like financial services and insurance continued hiring for other reasons.\n- **Increased demand and pay for AI specialists.** Even as AI allowed reductions in some roles, it **raised demand and wages for highly specialized AI technology positions**, indicating a reallocation of labor toward higher‑skill technical roles.\n\nAs a result, AI’s effect on employment decisions was **uneven across sectors**: it enabled cuts and hiring slowdowns in some areas while simultaneously **boosting demand for specialized AI talent**.\n\n---\n\n## 7. What the evidence does *not* show\n\nThe provided Beige Book excerpts make some things clear by their absence:\n\n- **No detailed evidence** that AI directly changed **formal hiring criteria or HR processes** (e.g., no explicit mention of AI‑based resume screening or automated scoring changing who gets interviewed).\n- **No documented increase in temp or temp‑to‑hire arrangements tied to AI** in these excerpts.\n- **No concrete examples** in this material of AI systems making **individual firing, promotion, or scheduling** decisions.\n\nWhere earlier summaries may have suggested these dynamics, the specific text here either does not confirm them or only supports them at a very high level.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**\n- AI and generative AI **caused firms to reduce or slow growth in headcount**, especially in roles and tasks held by less‑experienced workers, by making those tasks automatable.\n- This led to **layoffs, early retirements, and, more commonly, “hiring chills” and unfilled vacancies**, as managers used attrition to shrink or reshape their workforces.\n- Firms simultaneously **prioritized retaining experienced employees** and increased demand for **highly specialized AI talent**, shifting the composition of employment rather than eliminating work across the board.\n- The current evidence shows AI affecting **aggregate employment decisions (how many and what types of workers)** much more clearly than it shows AI directly making **individual HR decisions** about specific people.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth is short and specific: AI affected employment decisions in that some employers cited increased investment in AI technologies as a reason for lowering head counts via layoffs and attrition.\n\nKey facts:\n1) Employers increased investment in AI technologies.\n2) This was explicitly cited as a reason for lowering head counts.\n3) The mechanisms were layoffs and attrition.\n\nThe system answer contains all of these points, though in a much more elaborate form:\n- It repeatedly mentions firms investing in AI tools/AI adoption/gen AI.\n- It explicitly states that some firms directly linked layoffs and staff reductions to AI, and that headcount reductions, hiring chills, and unfilled vacancies were tied to AI adoption and implementations.\n- It references reductions in staff levels through attrition, layoffs, and early retirements coupled with investment in AI, which is fully consistent with the expected answer.\n\nThe added details about sectoral differences, hiring chills, prioritizing experienced workers, and uneven effects are all extensions but not contradictory. There are no factual contradictions with the ground truth and the core causal relationship (AI investment → lowered headcounts via layoffs/attrition) is clearly present and repeatedly emphasized.\n\nThus the answer is correct and more detailed than required, not wrong or incomplete relative to the expected answer.",

FRB Philadelphia, District Highlights (BeigeBook_20251015)\n\n5. **Overall causal summary**\n- **Higher tariffs and waning demand** created a challenging environment for manufacturing nationally.  \n- **In districts where economic activity declined or softened**, these pressures translated into:\n  - Manufacturing that was **“little changed”** or **“largely stable”** (New York, San Francisco), and\n  - **Slight to modest declines** in manufacturing in some other districts (Chicago, Richmond), even when the full district-wide downturn is not always explicitly documented in the excerpts.  \n- **As a result**, the typical pattern in declining districts was **no manufacturing expansion**—instead, manufacturers either **stagnated** or **pulled back slightly**, while districts with growing overall activity (Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta) saw **modest to moderate manufacturing growth**.\n\nThus, when overall economic activity declined, manufacturing generally **did not grow**; it was held down by weaker demand and tariff-related pressures, leading to **flat or slightly negative manufacturing outcomes** in those districts.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the expected answer:\n- Focus is specifically on the four districts where overall economic activity declined: New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco.\n- New York: manufacturing held steady after a summer uptick (flat).\n- Minneapolis: manufacturing was flat.\n- Kansas City: manufacturing output growth moderated (slowed, but not necessarily negative).\n- San Francisco: manufacturing activity remained stable (flat).\n- Overall characterization: in declining districts, manufacturing was flat to slightly moderating, not clearly declining.\n\nSystem answer assessment:\n- It correctly describes New York manufacturing as “little changed” after a prior uptick (matches flat/steady characterization).\n- It correctly describes San Francisco manufacturing as “largely stable” (matches stable/flat).\n- It explicitly says the Kansas City excerpts do not state the manufacturing response, so it does not supply the correct information that growth moderated.\n- It does not mention Minneapolis at all, so it omits the fact that Minneapolis manufacturing was flat.\n- At the aggregate level it generalizes that in districts where activity declined, manufacturing “either held flat or declined modestly” and “flat or slightly negative manufacturing outcomes,” which overshoots the ground truth: the expected answer does not say there were modest declines in manufacturing in those four declining-activity districts; instead, it says flat to slightly moderating, which is not the same as outright decline.\n- The system also brings in Chicago, Richmond, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta and national tariff explanations, which are outside the scope of the question (and not in the ground truth) and uses them to assert “slight to modest declines in manufacturing in some other districts.” This extends beyond the asked set of districts and partially contradicts the ground-truth overall summary by emphasizing decline rather than moderation/flatness for the relevant group.\n\nBecause:\n- It omits Minneapolis entirely and omits the specific \"growth moderated\" point for Kansas City.\n- It adds a general claim of modest declines and flat-or-negative outcomes that is not supported by the expected answer for the four declining districts.\n- It introduces extra districts and causality that are not asked for and shifts the overall characterization away from “flat to slightly moderating” toward “flat or declining,”\n\nthe answer is incomplete and somewhat misleading relative to the expected answer. The included district-specific facts for New York and San Francisco are accurate, and the high-level idea that manufacturing did not grow much is directionally similar, but important required details are missing and the generalized “declined modestly” framing is not supported by the ground truth for the specific set of districts.\n\nThis fits best as PARTIALLY_CORRECT: some correct elements, but incomplete and with overgeneralization that mischaracterizes the overall pattern, though not a clear, direct factual contradiction of a stated figure.\n",

      "expected_answer": "Six districts mentioned both tariff impacts on manufacturing AND labor shortages from immigration policies: (1) New York - tariff uncertainty weighed on manufacturers with one temporarily ceasing production due to high steel prices, while businesses in construction and hospitality reported difficulty finding workers due to immigration policy shifts. (2) Philadelphia - manufacturers reported increased cost pressures from tariffs and some tariff-related onshoring, while contacts noted disruptions from immigration policies including vacated positions due to visa status changes and decline in foreign-born workers in construction. (3) Atlanta - concerns over tariffs remained prevalent among manufacturers, while immigration policy impacts were more material than previously reported in agriculture and hospitality sectors. (4) Chicago - manufacturing contacts attributed metals price increases to tariffs, while contacts noted fear of immigration enforcement was reducing labor availability and revoked visas created rehiring needs. (5) St. Louis - contacts reported managing tariffs as a cost factor, while immigration policies resulted in labor shortages with workers in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture not reporting to work due to fears of deportation. (6) San Francisco - higher import duties led to cost increases for raw materials and electronic components used in manufacturing, while contacts in construction and manufacturing noted difficulty finding entry-level workers attributed to reduced immigration.",
      "system_answer": "Districts that mentioned both tariff impacts on manufacturing and labor shortages from immigration policies:\n\n- **Boston District (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston)**  \n  - **Tariff impacts on manufacturing:** The Boston District reported manufacturing job cuts tied to tariff-related cost increases.  \n  - **Labor shortages from immigration policies:** The same report highlighted concerns about future labor supply due to expected reductions in seasonal visas, indicating immigration-policy-related labor shortages. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\nBased on the provided evidence, the Boston District is the only district that satisfies both conditions.\n",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth states clearly that there are six districts that mentioned both tariff impacts on manufacturing and labor shortages from immigration policies: New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco. The system answer instead identifies only the Boston District as meeting both conditions and explicitly claims it is “the only district that satisfies both conditions.” This directly contradicts the expected answer both in (1) omitting all six correct districts and (2) asserting a single, different district (Boston) as the only one. Therefore, the system answer is not just incomplete; it is factually wrong relative to the ground truth.",

      "expected_answer": "Steel prices decreased in the Atlanta (Sixth) District and lumber prices decreased in the San Francisco (Twelfth) District. In both cases, waning demand in those markets pushed prices down. This occurred even as overall prices rose during the reporting period.",
      "system_answer": "Across districts, the materials that saw price decreases and their causes can be summarized as follows, organized by district and framed explicitly in cause‑and‑effect terms.\n\n---\n### Sixth District (Atlanta) – Steel\n\n**What fell:**\n- Steel prices\n\n**Cause → Effect:**\n- **Waning demand for steel in some markets** reduced buyers’ willingness to pay and increased competition among suppliers.\n- This was caused by softer activity in end‑use sectors that consume steel (e.g., certain manufacturing and construction uses), which lowered order volumes.\n- As a result, **steel prices declined** in the Sixth District as suppliers cut prices to clear inventories and retain business.  \n[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025‑10‑15]\n\n---\n### Tenth District (Kansas City) – Construction Materials\n\n**What fell:**\n- Prices for construction materials (along with sales of construction materials and volume of construction underway)\n\n**Cause → Effect:**\n- **Commercial real estate (CRE) activity moderated and residential development slowed.**\n- This was caused by weaker demand for new property development, which led developers to scale back projects.\n- As a result, **sales of construction materials fell** and **the volume of construction underway declined**.\n- With lower demand and excess supply of materials, suppliers faced pressure to cut prices to stimulate sales.\n- As a result, **prices for construction materials decreased** in the Kansas City District.  \n[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City > Real Estate and Construction]\n\n---\n### Twelfth District (San Francisco) – Lumber\n\n**What fell:**\n- Lumber prices\n\n**Cause → Effect:**\n- **Softer demand conditions for lumber**—likely tied to cooling in construction and related sectors—reduced order volumes from builders and other users.\n- This was caused by a slowdown in activity in sectors that consume lumber (noted broadly as weaker demand, rather than any specific shock).\n- As a result, **lumber prices declined** in the Twelfth District as suppliers lowered prices in response to reduced demand.  \n[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025‑10‑15]\n\n---\n### Other Price Decreases Mentioned in the Broader Beige Book\n\nWhile your question focuses on **materials**, the Beige Book also notes a few other notable price declines. These help complete the causal picture but are less tied to industrial “materials” and more to commodities and energy:\n\n#### Chicago District (Seventh) – Soybeans and Corn (Agricultural Commodities)\n\n**What fell:**\n- Soybean and corn prices received by farmers\n\n**Cause → Effect (from the original Beige Book, not reinforced by new chunks):**\n- **Weak export demand**, including an absence of new‑crop soybean exports to China, reduced foreign buying.\n- This was caused by trade patterns and demand conditions in key export markets.\n- As a result, **prices for soybeans (and to a lesser extent corn) declined**, as farmers faced a softer global market.\n\n*(Note: This causal link to exports and China comes from the original Beige Book text; the new evidence set you provided does not repeat or expand this.)*\n\n#### Ninth District (Minneapolis) – Multiple Farm Products\n\n**What fell:**\n- Prices received by farmers for: soybeans, wheat, pulse crops, hay, chickens, eggs, and milk\n\n**Cause → Effect:**\n- **General agricultural market conditions**—including ample supply and relatively weak demand—put downward pressure on farm‑gate prices.\n- This was caused by broader supply‑demand imbalances in agricultural markets rather than a specific local shock documented in the new excerpts.\n- As a result, **prices for these crops and livestock products were lower than a year earlier**.\n\n*(No additional, more specific causes appear in the new evidence for Minneapolis.)*\n\n#### Second (New York) and Ninth (Minneapolis) Districts – Milk and Eggs\n\n**What fell:**\n- Milk and egg prices (reported in the full Beige Book)\n\n**Cause → Effect:**\n- **Market‑wide softness in dairy and egg prices** led to lower prices received by producers.\n- This was caused by broader commodity pricing trends and demand conditions in these markets.\n- As a result, **milk and egg prices declined** in these districts.\n\n*(The new New York evidence primarily discusses rising costs—tariffs, packaging, congestion pricing—and does not provide explicit causal language for these particular price decreases.)*\n\n#### National – Retail Fuel\n\n**What fell:**\n- Retail fuel prices (slightly, on balance across districts)\n\n**Cause → Effect:**\n- **Broader movements in wholesale and crude oil prices**, along with normal seasonal patterns, reduced input costs for retailers.\n- This was caused by national and global energy‑market dynamics rather than district‑specific events.\n- As a result, **retail fuel prices edged down slightly overall** across the Federal Reserve districts.  \n[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n\n---\n### Consolidated Cause‑Effect View for “Materials” by District\n\n- **Sixth District (Atlanta): Steel**  \n  Weaker end‑use demand → waning steel demand → suppliers lower prices → **steel prices decline**.\n\n- **Tenth District (Kansas City): Construction materials**  \n  Slower CRE and residential development → fewer projects and lower materials sales → excess supply and competition → **construction material prices decline**.\n\n- **Twelfth District (San Francisco): Lumber**  \n  Softer demand in construction and related sectors → reduced orders for lumber → downward pressure on prices → **lumber prices decline**.\n\nBeyond these, additional price declines were noted for agricultural commodities and retail fuel, but the clearest, district‑specific **material** price declines with explicit causes are steel (Atlanta), construction materials (Kansas City), and lumber (San Francisco), all driven fundamentally by **weaker demand** in their respective end‑use sectors.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Materials with price decreases: steel in the Atlanta (Sixth) District and lumber in the San Francisco (Twelfth) District.\n2) Cause: waning/weaker demand in those markets pushed prices down.\n3) Context: This occurred even as overall prices rose during the reporting period (background, not essential to list but must not be contradicted).\n\nCompare to the system answer:\n- It correctly identifies that in the Sixth District (Atlanta), steel prices fell, and attributes this to waning/softer demand for steel tied to weaker end‑use sectors. This matches both the material and the cause.\n- It correctly identifies that in the Twelfth District (San Francisco), lumber prices fell, and attributes this to softer demand conditions/weaker demand in construction and related sectors. This also matches both the material and the cause.\n- It adds another district (Tenth/Kansas City) and additional materials (construction materials) with price decreases and corresponding demand‑based explanations. These additions are not in the expected answer but are not stated to be instead of Atlanta or San Francisco; they are presented as additional examples. There is no contradiction with the ground truth.\n- It further lists other price declines (agricultural commodities, fuel, milk and eggs) and again frames them as demand‑driven. These are extra details, not required, but they do not conflict with the expected answer.\n- It does not contradict the idea that overall prices were rising; it simply doesn’t mention that macro context, which is acceptable because that is background rather than a key requirement of the question.\n\nAll key facts from the expected answer are present and accurate, and there are no factual contradictions relative to the expected answer. The inclusion of additional districts and materials is compatible and not misleading in context, since the question asks what materials saw price decreases and their causes, and the system is summarizing a broader set while still correctly covering the two required cases.\n\nTherefore, the answer satisfies the ground truth fully and adds consistent detail.",

      "question": "How did consumer spending patterns differ between income groups, and what drove those differences?",
      "expected_answer": "Higher-income individuals maintained strong spending on luxury travel and accommodation. Lower- and middle-income households sought discounts and promotions due to rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. This bifurcation was driven by rising prices eroding purchasing power for lower/middle-income groups while higher-income groups remained insulated.",
      "system_answer": "Consumer spending patterns differed sharply by income group, and those differences were driven by how much financial slack each group had, how sensitive they were to prices, and how they were affected by sector‑specific shocks. The relationships below are structured explicitly as cause → effect.\n\n---\n\n1. Income and budget constraints → Different overall spending paths\n\n- Cause: Lower and middle incomes faced tighter budget constraints and, in some cases, falling disposable income, making it harder to meet basic obligations.\n  - Evidence: The Beige Book notes that lower‑income households were more vulnerable to income declines and expected to face greater difficulty meeting obligations, with St. Louis contacts describing a “middle‑class recession,” where middle‑income consumers increasingly relied on credit and even food pantries. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- Effect on lower- and middle-income spending:\n  - This was caused by tighter budgets and limited savings buffers, which forced these households to:\n    - Cut back on discretionary spending (e.g., travel, youth entertainment). [St. Louis]\n    - Focus spending on essentials and look for the lowest possible prices.\n    - Reduce or delay big‑ticket or upgrade purchases (autos, furniture, equipment‑type goods inferred from manufacturer reports). [Richmond]\n\n- Effect on higher-income spending:\n  - Because higher‑income households had more disposable income and financial buffers, they were able to:\n    - Sustain or modestly increase spending, especially on services and discretionary items like travel, events, and luxury experiences. [Kansas City, St. Louis, New York]\n    - Continue spending on higher‑end retail categories such as apparel, cosmetics, and fragrances.\n  - As a result, overall consumer spending growth in some areas (e.g., New York District) was “buoyed by” mid‑ to upper‑income households, rather than by broad‑based strength across all income groups. [New York]\n\n---\n\n2. Price sensitivity and cost pass-through → Different purchasing behaviors\n\n- Cause: Lower incomes implied stronger price sensitivity; higher incomes allowed more tolerance for price increases.\n\n  a) Lower- and middle-income households\n  - This was caused by limited disposable income and a higher share of their budgets going to necessities, which meant any price increase hit them harder.\n  - As a result, they:\n    - Concentrated purchases around sales, deals, and markdowns, becoming more selective and deal‑driven shoppers. [Kansas City]\n    - Traded down to cheaper or used goods, or deferred replacement (e.g., customers in Richmond stretching equipment life or shifting to cheaper components). [Richmond]\n    - Forced retailers and some manufacturers serving price‑sensitive segments to hold prices steady or use discounts even when their own costs rose, in order to avoid losing these customers. [Cleveland, Richmond, National Summary]\n    - Increased comparative shopping across outlets and products, as implied by firms’ need to offer selective discounts and their reports of “increased customer price sensitivity.” [Cleveland, Richmond]\n\n  b) Higher-income households\n  - This was caused by greater ability to absorb price increases and their heavier presence in mid‑ to high‑end markets.\n  - As a result:\n    - Retailers in the San Francisco District “passed a sizable portion” of tariff‑driven cost increases on to consumers “mostly in the mid‑ to high‑end markets,” meaning higher‑income consumers disproportionately bore these price hikes. [San Francisco]\n    - Restaurants serving these segments, facing high ingredient costs, raised menu prices or, when meeting resistance, shrank portions or altered recipes rather than cutting prices—indicating that mid‑ and higher‑priced establishments directly transmitted cost pressures to better‑off diners. [San Francisco]\n    - Nationally, some manufacturing and retail firms fully passed higher import costs along to customers in less price‑sensitive segments, while firms serving more price‑sensitive (often lower‑income) clients held prices flat, again showing that higher‑income groups absorbed more of the cost pass‑through. [National Summary]\n\n---\n\n3. Access to and use of credit → Different ways of sustaining or cutting spending\n\n- Cause: Lower- and middle-income households had less cash buffer but still needed or wanted to maintain some level of consumption.\n\n- Effect on lower-/middle-income groups:\n  - This was caused by income shortfalls relative to expenses, pushing households to:\n    - Rely more on credit cards, “buy now, pay later” products, and other borrowing to cover everyday purchases and small discretionary items. [St. Louis]\n    - Turn to food pantries, signaling that a growing share of their budgets had to be devoted to basic necessities and that cash resources were strained. [St. Louis]\n  - As a result, financial institutions reported rising stress in consumer loan portfolios and expected increases in delinquencies among these segments. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- Effect on higher-income groups:\n  - Because higher‑income households did not need to stretch credit as aggressively for essentials, they:\n    - Continued to finance discretionary items (e.g., travel, events, luxury services) without the same degree of credit stress.\n    - Helped sustain demand in higher‑end service and retail sectors, even while lower‑income spending softened.\n\n---\n\n4. Sectoral exposure and job/income risk → Uneven spending cutbacks\n\n- Cause: Different industries and goods categories were affected unevenly by tariffs, input costs, housing‑related slowdowns, and shifts from goods to services.\n\n- How this hit lower- and middle-income households:\n  - This was caused by both their employment concentration in more cyclical or discretionary sectors and their reliance on those same sectors for consumption.\n  - As a result:\n    - Households connected to or dependent on discretionary sectors (e.g., restaurant work, construction-linked manufacturing, furniture) were more exposed to income risk when demand slowed. [Richmond, San Francisco]\n    - Slower demand for furniture and construction‑related goods, and weaker orders for office equipment or engine parts, signaled that businesses and consumers were cutting back on upgrades and non-essential purchases—behaviors consistent with middle‑ and lower‑income customers postponing or trading down on larger goods. [Richmond]\n    - Restaurants experiencing high ingredient costs and customer pushback on prices saw traffic decline, which is consistent with more budget‑constrained diners cutting back on eating out. [San Francisco]\n\n- How this affected higher-income oriented sectors:\n  - This was caused by higher-income consumers’ continued willingness to spend on experiences and premium goods.\n  - As a result:\n    - Travel, luxury services, and higher‑end retail saw relatively stronger or stable demand, supported mainly by mid‑ to upper‑income and upper‑income households. [St. Louis, New York]\n    - These sectors thus remained pockets of strength that “buoyed” aggregate consumer spending figures despite softness elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n5. Composition of spending and volatility → Different patterns in what gets cut first\n\n- Cause: Income level determines which categories are essential vs. discretionary, and how quickly spending responds to price or income shocks.\n\n- For lower- and middle-income households:\n  - This was caused by the need to prioritize essentials such as rent, utilities, food, and transportation.\n  - As a result:\n    - Discretionary categories (travel, youth entertainment, furniture upgrades, restaurant meals) were cut back early and sharply when prices rose or incomes fell. [St. Louis, Richmond, San Francisco]\n    - Firms serving these segments observed more abrupt changes in orders and sales when they attempted to raise prices, indicating that consumption for these groups became more volatile and sensitive to small shocks. [Cleveland, Richmond, National Summary]\n\n- For higher-income households:\n  - Because a smaller share of their budget is devoted to essentials, price and income shocks had a more muted impact on total spending.\n  - As a result:\n    - Their spending on discretionary services (e.g., travel, events, luxury experiences) was more stable or even growing, providing a buffer for service industries.\n    - They absorbed more of the tariff‑ and cost‑related price increases in mid‑ to high‑end markets without cutting back as severely.\n\n---\n\nIn sum, the key causal chain is:\n\n- Lower and middle incomes → tighter budgets and greater vulnerability to income/price shocks → higher price sensitivity and reliance on discounts/credit → cutbacks in discretionary and big‑ticket goods, greater volatility in spending.\n\n- Higher incomes → more financial slack and resilience to shocks → ability to absorb price increases and maintain or increase spending on travel, luxury services, and high‑end goods → these groups disproportionately “buoy” overall consumer spending even as lower‑income households pull back.\n",

      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Higher‑income individuals maintained strong spending on luxury travel and accommodation.\n2) Lower‑ and middle‑income households focused on discounts, promotions, and lower prices because of rising prices and economic uncertainty.\n3) The driver of this bifurcation was that rising prices eroded purchasing power for lower/middle‑income groups, while higher‑income groups remained comparatively insulated.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer clearly states that higher‑income households were able to sustain or modestly increase spending on discretionary services such as travel, events, luxury experiences, and higher‑end retail. This matches point (1), even if it doesn’t explicitly say “accommodation,” travel and luxury experiences cover the same idea.\n- It also explicitly notes that lower‑ and middle‑income households focused on essentials, cut discretionary spending, became more deal‑driven, concentrated purchases around sales, and sought discounts and markdowns, which aligns with point (2).\n- On the cause, the system answer repeatedly attributes these differences to tighter budgets, limited savings buffers, higher price sensitivity, rising costs, and greater vulnerability to income/price shocks for lower/middle‑income groups, contrasted with higher‑income households’ “more disposable income and financial buffers” and ability to absorb price increases. This matches point (3) about erosion of purchasing power vs insulation from shocks.\n- There are no contradictions with the expected answer; the system answer is much more detailed, but the added details are consistent and not incorrect relative to the ground truth.\n\nAll key elements in the expected answer are present and correctly described; the answer is more elaborate but not wrong.\n",

      "question": "What is the relationship between AI investment and employment trends reported in the Beige Book?",
      "expected_answer": "Some employers cited increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies as one of the reasons for lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. This occurred alongside other factors like weaker demand and elevated economic uncertainty. Overall employment levels were largely stable, but demand for labor was generally muted, with more employers reporting layoffs and attrition.",
      "system_answer": "Across the October 15, 2025 Beige Book, AI investment is portrayed as a contributing cause of softer labor demand and selective job reductions, rather than as a neutral background trend.\n\n1. How AI investment is causing employment changes nationally\n- Firms increased investment in AI tools and capabilities.\n- This was caused by a mix of cost-control pressures, weaker or uncertain demand, and the availability of new AI technologies.\n- As a result, **some employers explicitly cited this increased AI investment as a reason for lowering headcounts** through layoffs and attrition, alongside slower business activity and uncertainty. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- This contributed to **muted labor demand and generally stable-to-slightly softer employment**, rather than broad-based job growth. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. District-level cause–effect links\n\nSan Francisco District\n- Firms in manufacturing and health care invested in AI tools for tasks and roles “usually reserved for less experienced employees.” [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- This was caused by firms seeing AI as a way to automate routine or junior-level work.\n- As a result, staff reductions (via attrition, layoffs, early retirements) were **“coupled with investment in AI”**, especially in entry-level or less-experienced positions. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Consequently, AI investment **contributed to fewer entry-level opportunities**, while overall employment in the district remained roughly unchanged and hiring was mostly replacement hiring.\n\nKansas City District\n- Professional services firms adopted and implemented new AI capabilities.\n- This adoption was driven by efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs.\n- As a result, some firms reported **“larger layoffs…associated with the adoption and implementation of AI capabilities that reduced overall labor needs.”** [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- These AI-related layoffs **caused a small net decline in employment** in the district and contributed to **subdued wage growth**, because labor demand weakened. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nMinneapolis District\n- Firms began integrating AI tools into their workflows, especially for routine, lower-skill tasks.\n- This was caused by AI’s ability to complete basic or repetitive tasks faster.\n- As a result, contacts expected AI to have **“a slight dampening effect on future labor demand.”** [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- One advertising firm said there would be **“a smaller need for entry-level folks” because AI tools complete that work faster**, meaning AI adoption is **expected to cause reduced hiring at the entry level** going forward. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- This contributed to **slightly lower employment and softening labor demand** in the district. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nAtlanta District\n- Firms began experimenting with and implementing generative AI.\n- This was caused by early evidence that generative AI can substitute for some human tasks and by firms’ desire to control labor costs amid uncertain demand.\n- As a result, several firms reported a **“hiring chill”** and more frequent headcount reductions, and some said they **expect further cuts “based on early Generative AI implementation results,”** especially if overall demand slows. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Thus, AI implementation is **contributing to more cautious hiring plans and potential future job cuts**, even though current overall employment in the district was described as flat. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n3. Overall causal story from the Beige Book\n- **Cause:** Increased investment in AI and generative AI technologies, motivated by cost-saving, efficiency gains, and weaker demand in some sectors.\n- **Immediate Effects:**\n  - Employers use AI to automate tasks traditionally performed by less-experienced or entry-level workers.\n  - This has caused **targeted layoffs, attrition-based reductions, and fewer entry-level openings** in multiple districts. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Some firms report **larger layoffs than they otherwise would have**, directly “associated with” AI adoption that reduces labor needs. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Downstream Effects on Employment Trends:**\n  - Labor demand is **cooling at the margin**, particularly for entry-level or routine roles.\n  - Wage pressures ease in some areas because reduced labor needs weaken workers’ bargaining power. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Overall employment in most districts is **flat to slightly down**, rather than sharply contracting, since AI-related cuts are still described as modest or anticipated rather than massive.\n\nIn summary, the Beige Book describes a causal relationship in which **firms’ rising AI investment and implementation are beginning to reduce demand for certain types of labor—especially entry-level and routine jobs—causing targeted layoffs, smaller hiring plans, and a mild softening of labor demand**, while leaving overall employment only slightly weaker so far. [BeigeBook_20251015]",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth says: (1) some employers cited increased AI investment as a reason for lowering headcounts via layoffs and attrition; (2) this occurred alongside weaker demand and uncertainty; (3) overall employment was largely stable; (4) labor demand was muted, with more employers reporting layoffs and attrition. \n\nThe system answer: \n- Explicitly states that some employers cited increased AI investment as a reason for lowering headcounts through layoffs and attrition, alongside slower activity and uncertainty. This matches the core causal relationship. \n- States that this contributed to muted labor demand and stable-to-slightly softer employment, matching \"overall employment levels were largely stable\" and \"demand for labor was generally muted.\" \n- It provides detailed district-level examples supporting those same themes (AI tied to staff reductions, muted labor demand, flat or slightly down employment), which is consistent with the expected answer and not contradictory. \n- It does not introduce any factual claims that contradict the ground truth summary; it just adds more granularity (entry-level focus, wage effects, district specifics), which is compatible with the high-level description. \n\nAll key points from the expected answer are present and correctly characterized, and there are no errors or contradictions. Therefore the answer is correct rather than merely partial.",

      "question": "Compare the economic outlook between districts that saw growth versus those that saw decline.",
      "expected_answer": "Districts with growth (Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond) had mixed-to-cautiously-optimistic outlooks: Boston was neutral to cautiously optimistic with mostly downside risks; Philadelphia expected modest growth but noted heightened uncertainty. Districts with decline (New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco) had varied outlooks: New York businesses did not expect activity to increase much; Kansas City was broadly optimistic for 2026 despite recent declines; Minneapolis saw contraction across most sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Below is a side‑by‑side comparison of the economic outlook in districts that saw growth versus those that saw decline, using the specific district evidence available and the national summary context.\n\n---\n### 1. Overall current conditions\n\n**Growth districts**  \n- Nationally, **three districts reported slight to modest growth in overall activity**. [National Summary – Overall Economic Activity]\n- **Philadelphia (Third District)**: “Business activity increased slightly” in the latest period; both nonmanufacturing and manufacturing activity rose (slightly and moderately, respectively). [Highlights – Philadelphia]\n- **Boston (First District, manufacturing)**: “Manufacturing sales rose modestly since the last report, on average.” [Boston – Manufacturing and Related Services]\n- A **third growing district** is implied by the national count but is **not named** in the provided excerpts. [National Summary – Overall Economic Activity]\n\n**Declining districts**  \n- **New York (Second District)**: Economic activity “**continued to decline slightly**,” indicating that weakness was not just a one‑off but a continuation. [BeigeBook_20251015, New York]\n- **San Francisco (Twelfth District)**: Economic activity “**edged down slightly**,” signaling a mild contraction. [BeigeBook_20251015, San Francisco]\n\n**Comparison**  \n- In growth districts such as **Philadelphia** and **Boston**, activity is described as **rising slightly or modestly**, often led by manufacturing. [Highlights – Philadelphia; Boston – Manufacturing]  \n- In contrast, in **New York** and **San Francisco**, activity is described as **declining slightly or edging down**, indicating mild contraction instead of expansion. [BeigeBook_20251015 – New York; San Francisco]\n\n---\n### 2. Near‑term outlook (next ~6–12 months)\n\n**Growth districts**  \n- **Philadelphia**: “Generally, firms **expect modest growth over the next six months**, but heightened economic uncertainty remains.” [Highlights – Philadelphia]\n- **Boston**: Manufacturing contacts were “**mostly optimistic about their prospects through the end of the year**,” i.e., the near term, though with caveats about later periods. [Boston – Manufacturing]\n- Nationally, sentiment “**improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months**,” which plausibly includes some of the slight‑growth districts. [National Summary – Overall Economic Activity]\n\n**Declining districts**  \n- **New York**: Businesses reported that they **did not expect much of an increase in activity in the months ahead**, pointing to a flat or only marginal improvement outlook after recent decline. [BeigeBook_20251015, New York]\n- **San Francisco**: Contacts’ **economic outlook “weakened somewhat”** relative to the prior period, implying **more caution** going forward rather than a rebound. [BeigeBook_20251015, San Francisco]\n\n**Comparison**  \n- In **growth districts**, firms generally anticipate **continued modest expansion** in the near term (6–12 months), even if not robust. [Highlights – Philadelphia; Boston – Manufacturing; National Summary]  \n- In **decline districts**, firms either **see little prospect for improvement** (New York) or report that their **outlook has weakened** further (San Francisco), suggesting **flat to slightly negative** expectations rather than growth. [BeigeBook_20251015 – New York; San Francisco]\n\n---\n### 3. Medium‑term outlook and trajectory\n\n**Growth districts**  \n- **Boston**: While near‑term prospects are mostly optimistic, “the **outlook for 2026 was slightly weaker on balance**, with headwinds related to tariffs, inflation, and uncertainty.” This implies a trajectory of **present modest growth that may slow or face more challenges over the medium term**. [Boston – Manufacturing]\n- **Philadelphia**: The text explicitly covers only the next six months, but the emphasis on **modest** (not strong) growth and “heightened economic uncertainty” suggests a **cautious medium‑term path** as well. [Highlights – Philadelphia]\n\n**Declining districts**  \n- **New York**: The statement that activity has “continued to decline slightly” coupled with expectations of **little increase ahead** suggests a medium‑term trajectory of **ongoing weakness or stagnation**, rather than a clear turning point toward recovery. [BeigeBook_20251015, New York]\n- **San Francisco**: With activity edging down and the outlook having “weakened somewhat,” the medium‑term trajectory is one of **increasing concern**, with risks tilted toward further softness rather than a quick rebound. [BeigeBook_20251015, San Francisco]\n\n**Comparison**  \n- Growth districts are on a path of **modest current expansion that may become more fragile over time**, especially beyond the next year (as in Boston’s weaker 2026 outlook). [Boston – Manufacturing]  \n- Declining districts face **continued or deepening softness**, with limited improvement expected; their medium‑term narrative is one of **lingering or worsening weakness**, not just a temporary dip. [BeigeBook_20251015 – New York; San Francisco]\n\n---\n### 4. Business sentiment and uncertainty\n\n**Growth districts**  \n- **Philadelphia**: Firms “expect modest growth over the next six months, but **heightened economic uncertainty remains**.” [Highlights – Philadelphia]\n- **Boston**: “**Uncertainty remained elevated**, presenting challenges,” and the weaker 2026 outlook is explicitly linked to “tariffs, inflation, and uncertainty.” [Boston – Manufacturing]\n- Nationally: While sentiment improved “in a few Districts,” “**many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity**.” [National Summary – Overall Economic Activity]\n\n**Declining districts**  \n- **New York**: The lack of expected improvement and continued slight decline implicitly reflects **cautious or subdued sentiment**, though the excerpt does not use the word “uncertainty” explicitly. [BeigeBook_20251015, New York]\n- **San Francisco**: The statement that the **economic outlook ‘weakened somewhat’** indicates that sentiment has turned more negative compared with the prior report. [BeigeBook_20251015, San Francisco]\n\n**Comparison**  \n- Both sets of districts operate under **elevated uncertainty**, but the tone differs:  \n  - In **growth districts**, uncertainty **tempers** otherwise modestly positive expectations. [Highlights – Philadelphia; Boston – Manufacturing; National Summary]  \n  - In **decline districts**, weak or weakening outlooks suggest that uncertainty is **amplifying downside concerns**, contributing to a more pessimistic stance. [BeigeBook_20251015 – New York; San Francisco]\n\n---\n### 5. Sectoral context and structural pressures\n\n**Growth districts**  \n- **Boston (Manufacturing)**: Gains are explicitly **sectoral**—“manufacturing sales rose modestly”—and the risks cited (tariffs, inflation) are directly relevant to trade‑exposed and cost‑sensitive industries, indicating that growth is present but vulnerable to external shocks. [Boston – Manufacturing]\n- **Philadelphia**: Both nonmanufacturing and manufacturing reported increases (“activity increased slightly for nonmanufacturers and moderately for manufacturers”), pointing to a **broad‑based but still modest** expansion. [Highlights – Philadelphia]\n\n**Declining districts**  \n- Nationally, “activity in the **agriculture, energy, and transportation** was generally down among reporting Districts,” which likely weighs more heavily on regions where these sectors are important. [National Summary – Overall Economic Activity]\n- While the provided excerpts for **New York** and **San Francisco** do not spell out specific sectors, the overall slight declines suggest **broad or multi‑sector softness**, and their weakened outlooks are consistent with the broader theme of softness in trade‑sensitive or interest‑sensitive areas. [BeigeBook_20251015 – New York; San Francisco]\n\n**Comparison**  \n- Growth districts’ modest gains often come from **manufacturing and services**, but are **exposed to headwinds** such as tariffs and inflation, which are already affecting medium‑term expectations. [Boston – Manufacturing; Highlights – Philadelphia]\n- Declining districts show **overall slight contractions**, consistent with national reports of **sectoral weakness** (agriculture, energy, transportation), implying that structural or sectoral pressures are more acute there and are dragging down the overall outlook. [National Summary; BeigeBook_20251015 – New York; San Francisco]\n\n---\n### 6. Aggregate position in the national distribution\n\n**Growth districts**  \n- Fall into the group of **three** that recorded “slight to modest growth in activity.” [National Summary – Overall Economic Activity]\n- Their collective outlook can be summarized as **modest growth expected, but with elevated uncertainty and identifiable policy and cost headwinds (tariffs, inflation, potential government shutdown as a national downside risk).** [National Summary; Boston – Manufacturing; Highlights – Philadelphia]\n\n**Declining districts**  \n- Are part of the broader group of districts that experienced **no change or softening**, with **New York and San Francisco explicitly in slight decline**. [National Summary; BeigeBook_20251015 – New York; San Francisco]\n- Their outlooks skew **subdued or worsening**, with fewer signs of the “uptick in demand” that some other districts anticipate, and more emphasis on **weakened outlooks and limited expected improvement.** [BeigeBook_20251015 – New York; San Francisco]\n\n**Comparison**  \n- On the national spectrum—from modest growth, to flat, to softening/decline—**Boston and Philadelphia** sit toward the **modest‑growth end**, while **New York and San Francisco** sit at the **softening/decline end**.  \n- The **gap in outlook** is therefore one of **direction and confidence**: growth districts expect **continued but modest expansion**, whereas decline districts expect **continued weakness or only marginal gains at best**, with sentiment that has recently **deteriorated rather than improved**.\n\n---\n### Key limitations\n- The national summary specifies **three growth districts and four with slight softening**, but only **Philadelphia and Boston (manufacturing)** are clearly identified among the growers, and only **New York and San Francisco** are clearly named among the decliners in the provided excerpts. [National Summary; Boston – Manufacturing; Highlights – Philadelphia; BeigeBook_20251015 – New York; San Francisco]\n- We cannot, from the given text, definitively name the **third growth district** or all **four softening districts**, nor can we fully detail the outlooks for other districts (e.g., Kansas City, Richmond, Chicago) that may fall into “softening” or “no change” based on other parts of the Beige Book not included here.\n\nWithin those limits, the comparative picture is clear: **growth districts are experiencing modest expansion with cautious optimism, while decline districts face slight but persistent contraction and more pessimistic or weakened outlooks.**",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "The expected answer highlights specific districts and characterizations:\n- Growth: Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond → neutral to cautiously optimistic; Boston neutral/cautiously optimistic with downside risks; Philadelphia modest growth but heightened uncertainty.\n- Decline: New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco → New York doesn’t expect much increase; Kansas City broadly optimistic for 2026 despite recent declines; Minneapolis contraction across most sectors.\n\nThe system answer:\n- Correctly characterizes Boston and Philadelphia as modest/growth with cautious/uncertain outlooks; discusses near‑term and 2026 outlook for Boston and modest 6‑month growth with uncertainty for Philadelphia. This aligns with part of the ground truth for growth districts.\n- However, it entirely omits Richmond, which is explicitly listed as a growth district in the expected answer.\n- On the decline side, it talks about New York and San Francisco and characterizes them as slightly declining with weak/flat outlooks, which is consistent with the expected answer’s description of New York and San Francisco.\n- It does not mention Minneapolis or Kansas City at all, thus missing key expected elements: Minneapolis’s broad contraction and Kansas City’s broadly optimistic 2026 outlook despite recent declines.\n- It introduces various national‑summary details and sectoral context not in the expected answer, but these aren’t directly contradictory; they are extra context.\n- There is no clear factual contradiction with the expected answer; the main issue is incompleteness and different district set (doesn’t identify all the ones named in the ground truth, and instead claims only New York and San Francisco among decliners, while hedging that others aren’t named in provided excerpts).\n\nBecause the system answer captures some but not all key facts and omits Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City perspectives, yet does not introduce clear falsehoods relative to the expected answer, it is best classified as incomplete but not misleading.\n\nVerdict: PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

      "question": "How did trade-related concerns affect the agriculture sector across different districts?",
      "expected_answer": "In the Minneapolis District, agricultural contacts were specifically concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases, representing a direct trade policy impact. In the St. Louis District, agriculture conditions were strained and further deteriorated, with the overall pessimistic outlook. Across reporting districts, activity in agriculture was generally down, with trade uncertainty adding to sector challenges.",
      "system_answer": "Trade-related concerns affected the agriculture sector mainly by disrupting export markets (especially with China), which then drove down prices for key crops, squeezed farm finances, and curtailed investment. These chains of cause and effect played out differently across districts.\n\n1. How trade concerns reduced demand and exports\n\n- China’s changing buying patterns\n  - In the **Atlanta District**, “trade policy volatility” weighed on exports. This was caused by foreign buyers, including China, shifting to **lower‑priced suppliers abroad**. As a result:\n    - Overseas **rice** sales fell as buyers turned to other countries offering lower prices.\n    - For **soybeans, wheat, and corn**, Chinese markets turned to **Brazil**, reducing demand for these U.S. crops and keeping their prices depressed in the district. [Atlanta – Agriculture]\n  - In the **Chicago District**, soybean exports to China for the new crop were essentially absent. This was caused by trade tensions with China, which led Chinese buyers to stop taking new‑crop soybeans from the U.S. As a result, **soybean prices were lower** in the district. [Chicago – Agriculture]\n  - In the **Minneapolis District** (national highlight), agricultural contacts were concerned about **China’s elimination of soybean purchases**. This was caused by China stepping away from U.S. soybeans altogether, which contacts feared would hurt demand and prices for soybean producers in that region. [National Summary – Minneapolis]\n\n- Broader export weakness and uncertainty\n  - In **San Francisco**, contacts noted that **demand from abroad, particularly from China, continued to fall** because of “trade policy adjustments and negotiations.” This fall in foreign demand was caused by ongoing trade negotiations and policy shifts, which made buyers hesitant and pushed them to alternative sources. As a result, overall conditions in agriculture in this largely crop‑producing district **weakened slightly**, with lower sales expectations for exporters. [San Francisco – Agriculture]\n  - More generally, in several districts’ manufacturing sectors, **tariff and trade-policy uncertainty** was reported as weighing on overseas demand for U.S. goods and complicating planning. This environment was caused by tariffs and shifting trade rules; as a result, it reinforced caution among agricultural exporters facing the same global conditions. [Boston – Manufacturing; New York – Manufacturing]\n\n2. How weaker trade translated into lower farm prices\n\n- Crop price declines\n  - **Chicago District**:\n    - **Soybean prices fell**, caused in part by the **absence of new‑crop exports to China**. With a major buyer gone, excess supply put downward pressure on prices.\n    - **Corn prices were down** even though export volumes were still strong, suggesting that global price competition (amid trade uncertainty) kept corn prices low despite solid shipments. [Chicago – Agriculture]\n  - **Atlanta District**:\n    - **Soybean, wheat, and corn prices “remained depressed.”** This was caused by Chinese buyers shifting to **Brazil** and other cheaper suppliers for these commodities, reducing demand for U.S. output and keeping prices under pressure. [Atlanta – Agriculture]\n  - **San Francisco District**:\n    - Contacts reported **low prices for agricultural commodities in general**, caused partly by falling foreign demand (especially from China) linked to trade policy changes. As a result, producers of various Western crops faced weaker revenue per unit sold. [San Francisco – Agriculture]\n\n- Livestock relative resilience\n  - In contrast, some **livestock-related sectors** were helped by stronger domestic (non‑trade) demand:\n    - In the **Atlanta District**, **domestic demand for beef and poultry** was strong. This strength was caused by robust U.S. consumer and food‑service demand rather than exports. As a result, beef and poultry producers in the district fared better than grain growers exposed to export markets. [Atlanta – Agriculture]\n    - In the **Chicago District**, **cattle and hog prices rose to record territory**. This was caused by solid demand and limited supply in meat markets, which offset the negative trade shock hitting row crops. As a result, livestock producers were comparatively better off than grain and some dairy producers (milk and egg prices declined). [Chicago – Agriculture]\n\n3. How trade-related pressures strained farm finances and investment\n\n- Financial strain from low prices and higher costs\n  - **San Francisco District**:\n    - Producers faced **higher packaging costs** and **high financing costs**, at the same time as commodity prices stayed low. These cost pressures were caused by broader input inflation and, in some cases, tariffs on materials.\n    - As a result, low selling prices plus higher input and financing costs “continued to put **financial strain on producers**,” and **anticipated declines in sales volume** (linked to weaker foreign demand) led contacts to say they would **limit investment for the following season**. [San Francisco – Agriculture]\n  - **Chicago District**:\n    - Crop producers had already **cut costs** and had “limited flexibility left to further reduce expenses.” This was caused by sustained low prices for major crops like soybeans and corn, partly driven by trade disruptions with China.\n    - The resulting tight margins, combined with a **lack of clarity on the economic outlook** (including trade), were **putting a damper on capital investment**, such as **equipment purchases and repairs**. As a result, farm machinery purchases were being deferred, which both signaled and reinforced financial stress in Midwestern crop areas. [Chicago – Agriculture]\n\n- Spillovers to agricultural equipment producers\n  - In the **Cleveland District**, the impact appeared indirectly in manufacturing tied to agriculture:\n    - Several manufacturers reported **flat or weaker orders**, which they **attributed to import tariffs and persistent uncertainty about trade policy**. This uncertainty was caused by ongoing trade disputes and changing tariff schedules. [Cleveland – Manufacturing]\n    - Specifically, **firms selling into industrial and agricultural equipment production** reported **particularly weak demand**, with one noting that orders from these equipment producers were about **25% below expectations**. This shortfall was caused by customers (including farm‑equipment makers) pulling back due to weaker farm income and trade uncertainty. As a result, the agricultural equipment supply chain in the Cleveland District slowed, reinforcing the pullback in farm capital spending observed in places like Chicago. [Cleveland – Manufacturing]\n\n4. District-by-district patterns\n\n- **Atlanta District**\n  - Cause: Trade policy volatility and China’s shift to lower‑priced suppliers (Brazil and others) for rice, soybeans, wheat, and corn.\n  - Effect: Depressed export sales and prices for these crops; relatively stronger conditions for domestically oriented **beef and poultry** producers. [Atlanta – Agriculture]\n\n- **Chicago District**\n  - Cause: The **absence of new‑crop soybean exports to China** and broader trade‑induced price pressure.\n  - Effect: Lower soybean and corn prices, squeezed crop margins, prior cost‑cutting with little room for more, and **reduced capital investment** in equipment and repairs, even as **cattle and hog** prices reached record highs. [Chicago – Agriculture]\n\n- **Minneapolis District**\n  - Cause: **China’s elimination of soybean purchases**, as cited by agricultural contacts.\n  - Effect: Heightened concern about demand and income prospects for soybean producers in the Upper Midwest/Northern Plains, though the provided text does not spell out specific price or production outcomes. [National Summary – Minneapolis]\n\n- **San Francisco District**\n  - Cause: Falling foreign demand “particularly from China” due to “trade policy adjustments and negotiations,” plus higher input and financing costs.\n  - Effect: Slightly weaker agricultural conditions, low commodity prices, financial strain on producers, and **planned reductions in future investment** because contacts anticipated lower sales volumes. [San Francisco – Agriculture]\n\n- **Cleveland District (via equipment)**\n  - Cause: **Import tariffs and persistent trade-policy uncertainty** hitting manufacturers.\n  - Effect: **Particularly weak demand** for firms selling into **industrial and agricultural equipment production**, with orders roughly **25% below expectations**, signaling a slowdown in the farm‑equipment supply chain. [Cleveland – Manufacturing]\n\n5. Overall cause–effect chain across districts\n\n- Trade policy adjustments, tariffs, and negotiations—especially with **China**—created **uncertainty and reduced foreign demand** for U.S. agricultural commodities (notably **soybeans, corn, wheat, and rice**).\n- This reduced demand **caused**:\n  - **Lower export volumes or lost markets** (e.g., no new‑crop soybean exports to China; China turning to Brazil; weaker overseas rice sales).\n  - **Depressed farm‑gate prices** for major crops in districts like Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco.\n- Lower prices and weaker sales **caused**:\n  - **Strained farm finances**, as revenues fell while some input, packaging, and financing costs rose.\n  - **Cutbacks in capital spending**, with producers deferring equipment purchases and repairs (Chicago, San Francisco) and equipment‑related manufacturers reporting large order shortfalls (Cleveland).\n- Meanwhile, sectors less dependent on exports—such as **beef, poultry, and some hog operations**—often fared better because **strong domestic demand** partially insulated them from trade fallout (Atlanta, Chicago).\n\nIn sum, trade-related concerns impacted agriculture unevenly across districts but followed a common pattern: trade policy uncertainty and market shifts away from U.S. products—especially by China—reduced export demand, which in turn depressed crop prices, weakened farm finances, and curtailed investment, while domestically driven livestock segments were comparatively more resilient.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key points in the expected answer:\n- In the Minneapolis District, agricultural contacts were specifically concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases.\n- In the St. Louis District, agriculture conditions were strained and deteriorating, with a pessimistic outlook.\n- Across reporting districts, agricultural activity was generally down, with trade uncertainty adding to challenges.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer correctly mentions Minneapolis and states that agricultural contacts were concerned about China’s elimination of soybean purchases, matching the ground truth.\n- It does not mention the St. Louis District at all, so the key fact about strained and deteriorating agricultural conditions there, with pessimistic outlook, is missing.\n- It does convey, in detail, that across several districts trade uncertainty and trade policy shifts (especially with China) reduced export demand, depressed prices, strained finances, and curtailed investment, which aligns with the idea that activity was generally down and trade uncertainty added to sector challenges.\n- There is no factual contradiction with the expected answer; the system answer is simply much more expansive and adds extra, plausible details from other districts, but omission of St. Louis makes it incomplete relative to the expected answer.\n\nGiven that some key facts (Minneapolis concern and general trade‑related weakness) are present and accurate, but the important St. Louis detail is missing, the answer is incomplete but not incorrect or misleading relative to the expected answer.\n\nVerdict: PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

In the Cleveland District, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to uncertainty around federal grants. In the Boston District, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health-care sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Federal policy changes affected nonprofits mainly by tightening public benefits and grant funding while community needs rose, and these dynamics played out in distinct but related ways across multiple Federal Reserve districts.\n\nBelow, each cause is paired with its effects, organized by policy channel and then by district.\n\n---\n## 1. Reductions or planned cuts in federal benefit programs (e.g., SNAP, Medicaid)\n\n### Cause\n- In several districts, contacts reported **reductions or planned cuts in federal benefit programs**—notably **SNAP and Medicaid**—and broader “reductions in federal benefit programs.” [New York, Boston]\n\n### Effects on nonprofits and communities\n\n**New York District (Second District)**\n- Cause: “A reduction in federal benefit programs” and **unpredictable funding** for nonprofits. [New York, Community Perspectives]\n- Effect on clients: This was caused by cuts/reductions in benefits, which **increased financial distress among Medicaid patients**.\n  - As a result, a **community health‑care center** reported that rising financial distress **limited patients’ access to care**.\n- Effect on the nonprofit: Because patients could not pay or lost benefits, this **strained the organization’s finances**, tightening revenue just as need increased.\n- Compounding factor: Rising business costs, “including insurance,” added further financial pressure on community service providers. As a result, even without explicit grant cuts, operating margins shrank. [New York, Community Perspectives]\n\n**Boston District (First District)**\n- Cause: Contacts cited **planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid** and price increases linked to tariffs. [Boston, Community Perspectives]\n- Effect on households: These planned federal cuts and policy‑linked price increases “posed additional risks to low‑ and moderate‑income households,” and were associated with **greater economic precarity**.\n  - As a result, communities saw **greater food pantry use** and **increased difficulty paying rent, utilities, and other bills**.\n- Effect on nonprofits: This rising precarity was caused in part by anticipated federal benefit cuts, so nonprofits (especially food pantries and other community providers) faced **higher demand for assistance** without a matching increase in resources.\n\n**Cross‑district pattern**\n- Across New York and Boston, the **same causal chain appears**:\n  - Federal benefit reductions or planned cuts → increased financial distress among low‑income and Medicaid‑covered households → higher demand for nonprofit‑provided food, health care, and basic‑needs support → **financial and operational strain on nonprofits** (e.g., community health centers, food pantries).\n\n---\n## 2. Federal funding and grant program timing/availability\n\n### Cause\n- Federal grants and program funds either **did not increase with need**, were **cut**, or were **at risk of delay**.\n\n### Effects on nonprofits and quasi‑nonprofits\n\n**St. Louis District (Eighth District)**\n- Cause: A hospital in Mississippi was participating in a **federal program designed to evaluate and plan for financial viability**, but its continued operation depended on new **federal grant funding**. [St. Louis, Nonfinancial Services]\n- Effect on the institution:\n  - This distress was caused by the fact that, despite being in the federal program, the hospital was still in **financial distress**.\n  - As a result, the CEO was **concerned that new grant funding may not arrive in time to stabilize operations**.\n- Broader nonprofit environment: In the same district, “nonprofit organizations reported a **growing demand for their services**.” [St. Louis, Nonfinancial Services]\n  - This was caused by worsening economic conditions and community need, while the timing and adequacy of federal funding remained uncertain.\n  - As a result, nonprofits were under pressure to serve more people without clear assurance that federal support would arrive when needed.\n\n**San Francisco District (Twelfth District)**\n- Cause: “Funding and grant cuts” affecting **community support organizations**. [San Francisco, Community Conditions]\n- Effect on nonprofits:\n  - These constraints were caused by reductions in public and grant support just as conditions worsened.\n  - As a result, **conditions in community support organizations weakened moderately**.\n  - At the same time, **demand for assistance rose**, particularly for “food, other basic household necessities, and health care.”\n  - Because funding and grant cuts limited their capacity, these organizations **could not fully meet the rising demand**.\n\n**New York District**\n- Cause: “Unpredictable funding” for nonprofits, alongside reductions in federal benefit programs. [New York, Community Perspectives]\n- Effect: This unpredictability was caused by unstable public and possibly grant‑related revenue streams.\n  - As a result, “many nonprofits” faced **challenges in planning and sustaining operations**, especially as patient/household distress grew.\n\n**Evidence limitations**\n- Earlier references to nonprofits tapping reserves, freezing hiring, or pivoting to fee‑based models were not documented in the provided excerpts. In this evidence set, the clearest funding‑mechanism effects are:\n  - Grant **cuts** (San Francisco),\n  - Grant **timing risk** (St. Louis hospital), and\n  - **Unpredictable funding** (New York).\n\n---\n## 3. Immigration‑policy changes and labor markets\n\n### Cause\n- The Beige Book documents **“recent changes to immigration policies”** and changes in workers’ **visa status**, which reduced the availability of foreign‑born labor in several sectors (hospitality, agriculture, construction, manufacturing) across multiple districts. [National Summary; Philadelphia, St. Louis, San Francisco]\n\n### Direct effects (documented) – mostly on labor markets\n\n- Nationally, labor supply in hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing was “strained” due to these immigration‑policy changes.\n- Philadelphia reported high employer demand to fill jobs vacated when employees’ **visa status changed**, and construction contacts cited delays and potential labor shortages due to fewer foreign‑born workers.\n- St. Louis contacts reported that immigration policies were “resulting in labor shortages.”\n- San Francisco agricultural contacts reported that immigration‑policy‑related labor shortfalls **reduced harvests**.\n\n### Indirect implications for nonprofits\n- The excerpts do not directly say “these immigration changes increased nonprofit caseloads,” but the **likely causal chain** is:\n  - Immigration‑policy changes → labor shortages and reduced output (e.g., smaller harvests, delayed construction) → economic stress for affected workers and communities → **higher demand for nonprofit and community support**.\n- Because that last link is not explicitly stated in the text, any claim that immigration policy **directly** increased nonprofit demand remains an informed interpretation rather than a documented quote for this Beige Book issue.\n\n---\n## 4. Rising operating costs and broader policy environment\n\n### Cause\n- Alongside federal benefit and grant changes, **rising operating costs** (including insurance) and policy‑driven price increases (e.g., from tariffs) affected both households and service providers.\n\n### Effects on nonprofits\n\n**New York District**\n- Cause: “Rising business costs, including insurance” for community service providers. [New York, Community Perspectives]\n- Effect: This was caused by broader economic and policy conditions, and it **added to financial pressures** on nonprofits already coping with reduced benefits and client distress.\n  - As a result, organizations had less budget flexibility to absorb funding gaps or surging demand.\n\n**Boston District**\n- Cause: “Further increases in consumer prices linked to tariffs” were expected. [Boston, Community Perspectives]\n- Effect on households: Higher prices were caused by tariff policies, which eroded real incomes for low‑ and moderate‑income households.\n  - As a result, households had **more difficulty paying for food, rent, utilities, and other bills**, increasing reliance on nonprofits, even though these organizations’ own resources were constrained by benefit and funding uncertainty.\n\n---\n## 5. Cross‑district comparison: how similar causes produced related, but locally distinct, outcomes\n\nBringing the districts together shows a common pattern with local variations:\n\n- **New York (Second District)**\n  - Cause: Reductions in federal benefit programs + unpredictable nonprofit funding + rising insurance costs.\n  - Effect: More financial distress among **Medicaid patients**, reduced access to care, and **financial strain** at a community health‑care center and other community service providers.\n\n- **Boston (First District)**\n  - Cause: Planned cuts to **SNAP and Medicaid** plus tariff‑linked price increases.\n  - Effect: Increased household precarity, evidenced by higher **food pantry use** and difficulty paying rent and utilities, which in turn raised pressure on nonprofits addressing food and housing‑related needs.\n\n- **San Francisco (Twelfth District)**\n  - Cause: **Funding and grant cuts** to community support organizations, amid rising need.\n  - Effect: Conditions in community support organizations **weakened**; they faced **higher demand for food, basic necessities, and health‑care assistance** but could not expand services fully because of reduced funding.\n\n- **St. Louis (Eighth District)**\n  - Cause: Dependence on **federal grant funding** for a financially distressed hospital; broader community need.\n  - Effect: Concern that federal grants might **not arrive in time to stabilize** the hospital, and simultaneous reports that nonprofits in the district saw **growing demand for their services**.\n\nAcross these districts, the **shared causal structure** is:\n- Federal policy changes (benefit reductions or planned cuts, grant cuts, and grant‑timing risks) and policy‑related cost pressures →\n- Greater financial and economic stress for low‑ and moderate‑income households (and Medicaid patients) →\n- Increased demand for nonprofit services (health care, food assistance, basic‑needs support) →\n- Heightened financial and operational strain on nonprofits, especially where **funding and grants were flat, cut, or delayed**.\n\n---\n## 6. What is *not* evidenced in the provided excerpts\n\nThe sub‑answers also highlight some points that **cannot** be firmly tied to this specific Beige Book release:\n- The excerpts do not directly document nonprofits:\n  - Drawing down reserves,\n  - Freezing or delaying hiring due to grant uncertainty,\n  - Facing new documentation or eligibility requirements, or\n  - Pivoting to fee‑based/commercial revenue models.\n\nThese may be plausible behaviors in response to the documented pressures, but they are not explicitly described in the cited text from the October 15, 2025 Beige Book and should be treated as outside what this evidence set can confirm.\n\n---\n**Bottom line:**\nFederal policy changes—especially reductions and planned cuts in federal benefit programs, grant funding cuts, and uncertainty about federal grant timing—caused increased financial distress among vulnerable households and institutions. As a result, nonprofits and community service organizations across multiple districts (notably New York, Boston, San Francisco, and St. Louis) experienced **rising demand for services at the same time that their own funding became less reliable or was cut**, leading to significant financial and operational strain. Immigration‑policy changes clearly tightened labor markets in several districts; these likely compounded community hardships, though the direct link to nonprofit caseloads is inferred rather than explicitly documented in the provided excerpts.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements of the expected answer:\n- New York: nonprofits faced challenges due to unpredictable funding and reduction in federal benefit programs; a community health-care center reported financial distress among Medicaid patients.\n- Cleveland: nonprofits were not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants.\n- Boston: cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in education and health-care sectors.\n\nComparison:\n- New York: The system answer correctly describes reductions in federal benefit programs, unpredictable funding, and a community health-care center seeing increased financial distress among Medicaid patients. This matches and even elaborates the New York portion.\n- Boston: The system answer discusses planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid, increased household precarity, higher food pantry use, and more difficulty paying bills. It does mention Boston but frames impacts mainly as higher demand on nonprofits; it does NOT mention that cuts to federal grant funding led to layoffs in education and health-care sectors, which is a specific key fact in the ground truth. So the Boston piece is only partially captured and misses the layoffs/grant-cut detail.\n- Cleveland: The system answer does not mention Cleveland at all, nor the fact that nonprofits were not filling open positions due to uncertainty around federal grants. This entire key fact is missing.\n- The system also introduces additional districts (St. Louis, San Francisco) and extensive detail, which is not required but not inherently wrong. However, it fails to address the Cleveland point and misses the specific Boston layoffs/grant cuts point that the question asks about.\n\nThere are no clear factual contradictions with the expected answer, but the answer is incomplete regarding two of the three district-specific points. Therefore it is partially correct, not fully correct.",

      "system_answer": "- **Hospitality sector**  \n  - Reported as experiencing labor supply strains due to recent changes in immigration policies in the **national summary** (covering “several Districts,” not individually named).  \n  - **Most prominently and explicitly mentioned in a specific District:** the **Atlanta District**, where immigration‑policy impacts on labor were described as “more material than previously reported” and **concentrated in hospitality in south Georgia**.  \n  - [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary; Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Labor Markets]\n\n- **Agriculture sector**  \n  - Identified in the **national summary** as one of the sectors where labor supply was strained in “several Districts” due to immigration policy changes.  \n  - **Most prominently and explicitly mentioned in a specific District:** the **Atlanta District**, where immigration‑policy‑related labor impacts were **concentrated in agriculture in south Georgia**, with those effects characterized as “more material than previously reported.”  \n  - [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary; Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Labor Markets]\n\n- **Construction sector**  \n  - Listed in the **national summary** as a sector where labor supply was strained in “several Districts” due to recent immigration policy changes.  \n  - A **Philadelphia District construction contact** (in the underlying report) specifically noted that reduced availability of foreign-born workers, linked to immigration policies, was causing project delays and could create a significant labor shortage if demand rises.  \n  - However, the new comparative evidence emphasizes that this Philadelphia detail is **not re‑documented** in the later excerpts and therefore should be treated cautiously as less firmly supported in the current record.  \n  - [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary; prior Philadelphia District excerpt]\n\n- **Manufacturing sector**  \n  - Cited in the **national summary** as one of the sectors where labor supply was strained in “several Districts” due to immigration policies.  \n  - The evidence provided does **not** clearly tie this sector to named Districts in the detailed excerpts, so no specific District can be definitively highlighted beyond the national‑level reference.  \n  - [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n\n- **Districts where immigration‑policy‑related labor shortages are most prominently mentioned**  \n  - **Atlanta District (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta)**  \n    - Stands out as the **only District** in the provided evidence where the sectors and geography are clearly and explicitly linked to immigration‑policy‑driven labor impacts.  \n    - Sectors: **agriculture and hospitality**.  \n    - Geography: **south Georgia**, with impacts described as “more material than previously reported” and geographically concentrated.  \n    - [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Labor Markets]\n\n  - **National context (several Districts, not individually named)**  \n    - The **national summary** reports that labor supply in **hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing** was strained in **“several Districts”** because of recent immigration policy changes, but it does **not** map each sector to specific Districts (other than Atlanta’s explicit agriculture and hospitality link).  \n    - [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary, Labor Markets]\n\n- **Previously suggested but not supported in the current evidence set**  \n  - **St. Louis District**: earlier notes suggested immigration‑related labor shortages, but the provided excerpts do not specify affected sectors; no sector–District linkage can be firmly documented here.  \n  - **San Francisco District (Twelfth)**: no evidence in the provided text of immigration‑policy‑driven agriculture or harvest labor shortages.  \n  - **New York and Philadelphia Districts**: beyond the earlier Philadelphia construction anecdote (not repeated in the new chunks), the supplied evidence does not freshly document immigration‑linked sectoral shortages.  \n  - **Energy sector**: not mentioned in the provided excerpts in connection with immigration policy.\n\nIn sum, the sectors explicitly reported as experiencing labor shortages or labor‑supply strains due to immigration policies are **hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing**, with the **Atlanta District’s agriculture and hospitality sectors in south Georgia** standing out as the most clearly and prominently documented District‑sector cases in the available evidence.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Four sectors with labor shortages due to immigration policy: hospitality, agriculture, construction, manufacturing.\n2) St. Louis District explicitly stated that contacts continue to report immigration policies resulting in labor shortages.\n3) Boston District: retail and tourism contacts worried about next summer’s labor supply given expected reductions in seasonal visas, with Maine and Vermont seeing increased labor market slack.\n\nComparison:\n- The system correctly identifies the four sectors: hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing.\n- However, it does not state that St. Louis is the District that explicitly reported immigration policies resulting in labor shortages. Instead, it says Atlanta is the only District where sectors and geography are clearly linked to immigration‑policy‑driven labor impacts and even notes that earlier suggestions about St. Louis are not supported in the current evidence. This contradicts the ground truth, which explicitly names St. Louis.\n- The system answer omits the Boston District’s role (retail and tourism worries about seasonal visas, Maine and Vermont slack) entirely.\n- It repeatedly emphasizes Atlanta as the most prominent District for immigration‑policy‑related labor effects, which conflicts with the expected answer that highlights St. Louis (explicit statement) and Boston (noted concerns) as the key Districts.\n\nSo while one element (the list of sectors) matches, the central part of the question—“in which districts was this most prominently mentioned?”—is answered incorrectly and even contradicts the ground truth by sidelining St. Louis and Boston and instead elevating Atlanta. This constitutes factual error relative to the expected answer, not just incompleteness.\n\nTherefore the answer is not just partially correct; it is incorrect in its core district attribution.",

      "question": "How did firms in different sectors respond to tariff-induced cost increases in terms of their pricing strategies?",
      "expected_answer": "Responses to tariff-induced costs varied by sector: In manufacturing and retail trades, some firms fully passed higher import costs along to customers. Other firms facing tariff-induced cost pressures kept selling prices largely unchanged to preserve market share and due to pushback from price-sensitive clients. In Chicago, a retail industry analyst expected peak tariff impact in the first half of 2026.",
      "system_answer": "Below is a side‑by‑side comparison by major sector, focusing on how firms adjusted prices in response to tariff‑induced cost increases and how those strategies differed.\n\n---\n### 1. Manufacturing vs. Services\n\n**Manufacturing: Generally higher and more explicit pass-through**  \n- **Minneapolis manufacturers:** Several manufacturers explicitly **raised prices or planned price hikes in direct response to tariffs**; about one‑fifth of firms raised prices in September while more than half reported higher input costs, indicating **partial but active pass‑through** rather than full absorption. [Source: Minneapolis > Prices]\n- **Dallas manufacturers:** District‑wide, **selling prices rose more sharply in manufacturing than overall because of tariffs**, with a computer manufacturer specifically noting tariff application on products (via steel and aluminum tariffs) that did not even contain these metals—evidence of **tariff‑driven price increases in manufacturing**. [Source: Dallas > Prices]\n- **New York manufacturers:** A **specialty appliance manufacturer in upstate New York** raised prices twice in the year to offset tariff‑related input costs, and an **upstate brewing company** reported passing elevated ingredient and packaging costs to consumers—both **clear examples of substantial pass‑through**. [Source: New York > Prices]\n- **Smaller manufacturers (Boston):** Smaller manufacturers in the Boston District reportedly **passed through a larger share of tariff costs** than others, implying **less ability to absorb shocks and more reliance on raising prices**. [Source: Boston > Prices]\n\nIn contrast, **services generally showed more cost absorption and price restraint**:  \n- **Boston restaurants and hotels:** Despite rising costs (including food and other operating expenses), **restaurants kept menu prices mostly unchanged and hotel room prices actually declined modestly year‑over‑year**, leading to margin compression. This indicates **limited pass‑through in services** even under cost pressure. [Source: Boston > Prices]\n- **National services pattern:** The national summary notes that some firms facing tariff‑induced cost pressures—often in services and other customer‑facing sectors—**kept selling prices largely unchanged to preserve market share and in response to pushback from price‑sensitive clients**, again showing a tendency to **absorb costs rather than fully pass them on**. [Source: National Summary > Prices]\n- **Professional/business services (Dallas, Philadelphia):** Firms reported **insurance and health‑care costs rising faster than revenues**, suggesting that many **absorbed these input increases** rather than quickly raising client prices. [Sources: Dallas > Prices; Philadelphia > Prices]\n\n**Comparison:** Manufacturing sectors (Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, Boston) more often **raised prices directly and explicitly because of tariffs**, while service sectors (Boston restaurants/hotels, professional services nationally) more often **held prices steady and accepted margin compression**, especially where customers were very price‑sensitive.\n\n---\n### 2. Retail & Distribution vs. Manufacturing\n\n**Retail & distribution: Mixed, category‑specific pass-through and strategic restraint**  \n- **New York major retailer:** A large retailer in the New York District **adjusted price increases item‑by‑item based on demand elasticity**, passing through more on items with inelastic demand and less where customers were price‑sensitive. This is **explicit elasticity‑based pricing**, contrasted with the more uniform pass‑through typical in manufacturing. [Source: New York > Prices]\n- **Cleveland retail:** Retail contacts reported **tariff‑driven cost increases in specific categories** such as vehicles, beef, coffee, and chocolate. This points to **product‑category‑specific pricing responses**, with some costs likely passed through in these items, though not uniformly across all goods. [Source: Cleveland > Prices]\n- **Importers/wholesalers (New York):** \n  - A **Long Island auto‑parts importer/wholesaler** and a **coffee roaster and supplier** both reported that tariffs on imports (from India and Brazil, respectively) **posed steep challenges to profitability**, forcing them to choose between raising prices and absorbing costs. The reports highlight **strong cost pressure but do not clearly document systematic surcharges**, implying **partial and uncertain pass‑through**. [Source: New York > Prices]\n\nBy comparison, **manufacturing responses were more uniformly in the direction of raising prices**:  \n- Minneapolis, Dallas, and upstate New York manufacturers **explicitly increased prices or planned increases because of tariffs**, suggesting a **more direct link from cost shocks to final prices** than the often nuanced, item‑by‑item strategies in retail. [Sources: Minneapolis > Prices; Dallas > Prices; New York > Prices]\n\n**Comparison:**  \n- **Manufacturing**: Tends toward **broad, sector‑wide or firm‑wide price increases** in response to tariffs, with explicit references to tariff‑driven hikes.  \n- **Retail/distribution**: Exhibits **heterogeneous and more finely targeted pricing**—some categories (vehicles, beef, coffee, chocolate) see higher prices, while others are shielded, guided by **elasticity and competitive pressures**.\n\n---\n### 3. Domestic Producers vs. Foreign Suppliers\n\n**Domestic downstream firms facing tariffs:**  \n- Across multiple districts, domestic manufacturers and retailers report **higher input costs from tariffs** and respond with a mix of **raising prices** (manufacturing, some retail items) and **absorbing costs** (services, price‑sensitive retail segments). [Sources: National Summary > Prices; Minneapolis > Prices; Dallas > Prices; New York > Prices]\n\n**Foreign suppliers: Tariff absorption to protect market share**  \n- **New York pharmaceuticals:** A pharmaceutical company reported that **foreign manufacturers were absorbing tariff costs to maintain market share and production levels**, effectively **limiting the price impact passed on to U.S. buyers** in that supply chain. [Source: New York > Prices]\n- **Cleveland contacts:** Two contacts noted that **foreign producers were “factoring in tariffs and cutting prices accordingly” to retain market share**, again meaning that some of the tariff burden was absorbed abroad rather than fully transmitted into U.S. prices. [Source: Cleveland > Prices]\n\n**Comparison:**  \n- **Domestic firms** more often **raised prices or faced profit squeezes** when tariffs increased input costs.  \n- **Foreign suppliers in some markets** strategically **cut their own prices or absorbed tariffs** to keep U.S. customers, thereby **reducing effective pass‑through** to domestic downstream firms in those specific sectors.\n\n---\n### 4. Within Services: Restaurants/Hotels vs. Other Services\n\n**Restaurants and hotels (Boston, New York): Strong price rigidity**  \n- **Boston:** Restaurants experienced **declining profitability while keeping menu prices mostly unchanged**, and **average hotel prices fell modestly despite higher operating costs**, indicating **very limited pass‑through** and a focus on volume/occupancy rather than margins. [Source: Boston > Prices]\n- **New York restaurants:** Some restaurants reported **rising food costs—particularly beef—and imported wine costs—hurting business**. While explicit statements about holding menu prices flat are not given, the emphasis is on **margin pressures** rather than successful price hikes, suggesting **constrained pass‑through**. [Source: New York > Prices]\n\n**Other services (professional, business, non‑restaurant services): Gradual or limited pass-through**  \n- Nationally, many service firms with tariff‑related input cost increases (including higher insurance and technology costs) **chose not to fully pass these costs through**, keeping prices “largely unchanged” to avoid losing price‑sensitive customers. [Source: National Summary > Prices]\n- In Dallas and Philadelphia, professional and business services noted **input costs (health care, insurance) rising faster than revenues**, indicating that **cost absorption and squeezed margins** were common. [Sources: Dallas > Prices; Philadelphia > Prices]\n\n**Comparison:**  \n- **Restaurants/hotels** in Boston and parts of New York appear **especially constrained**, often **not raising prices even as input costs rise**, leading to clear margin compression.  \n- **Other services** also show **partial pass‑through at most**, but with more scope for gradual price adjustments over time.\n\n---\n### 5. Cross-District, Cross-Sector Variation in Pass-Through\n\n**High/explicit pass-through clusters (mainly goods-producing):**  \n- **Manufacturing in Minneapolis and Dallas:** Multiple manufacturers have **explicitly raised prices in response to tariffs**, with manufacturing prices rising faster than overall prices. [Sources: Minneapolis > Prices; Dallas > Prices]\n- **Selected New York manufacturers:** The upstate specialty appliance maker and brewing company both **hiked prices to reflect higher tariff‑affected input costs**. [Source: New York > Prices]\n- **Smaller manufacturers (Boston):** Reportedly **passed on a larger fraction of tariff‑induced costs** than other manufacturers. [Source: Boston > Prices]\n\n**Mixed or selective pass-through (especially retail and some services):**  \n- **Retailers (Cleveland, New York):** Experienced **category‑specific cost increases** and used **selective pass‑through**, sometimes relying on elasticity‑based, item‑by‑item pricing (major New York retailer) or facing difficult trade‑offs (auto‑parts importer, coffee roaster). [Sources: Cleveland > Prices; New York > Prices]\n- **Nationally:** Some manufacturing and retail firms **fully passed higher import costs along to customers**, but many firms—especially those with price‑sensitive clients—**limited price increases** and absorbed part of the tariff burden. [Source: National Summary > Prices]\n\n**Low or constrained pass-through (services and hospitality):**  \n- **Restaurants and hotels (Boston) and some New York restaurants** show **very limited ability to raise prices**, with higher costs largely absorbed. [Sources: Boston > Prices; New York > Prices]\n- **Professional services** and other service‑sector firms often face **rising insurance and health‑care costs** but **cannot fully offset them through higher fees**, again indicating **restricted pass‑through**. [Sources: Dallas > Prices; Philadelphia > Prices; National Summary > Prices]\n\n---\n### 6. Overall Sectoral Comparison\n\n- **Manufacturing:** Most likely to **raise prices explicitly in response to tariffs**, with multiple districts reporting deliberate, tariff‑linked price hikes. Pass‑through is often substantial, though not always complete.\n- **Retail & distribution:** Responses are **highly heterogeneous**—some items and categories see significant pass‑through, while others are protected, with **elasticity‑based, product‑level pricing strategies** prominent in at least one major retailer.\n- **Services (especially restaurants/hospitality):** Tend to show **strong price rigidity**, often **absorbing tariff‑linked and other cost increases** to maintain demand, leading to margin squeezes.\n- **Foreign producers vs. domestic firms:** In some cases, **foreign producers absorb part of the tariff costs** through price cuts, contrasting with domestic manufacturers and retailers, who more often face a direct choice between **raising prices and accepting lower margins**.\n\nTaken together, the Beige Book evidence points to a clear sectoral pattern: **goods‑producing sectors (manufacturing) exhibit more direct and frequent tariff pass‑through, retail uses more selective and strategic pricing, and many service industries—especially restaurants and hotels—show the greatest reluctance or inability to raise prices despite tariff‑related cost shocks.**",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements of the expected answer:\n1) Sectoral heterogeneity: in manufacturing and retail some firms fully passed higher import costs on to customers.\n2) Other firms, especially with price‑sensitive clients, kept selling prices largely unchanged, absorbing costs to preserve market share.\n3) Explicit mention that in Chicago a retail industry analyst expected peak tariff impact in the first half of 2026.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer clearly captures (1) and (2): it repeatedly describes that some manufacturing and retail firms raised prices in response to tariffs (including cases of substantial or explicit pass‑through) while many others, particularly in services and price‑sensitive retail segments, held prices largely unchanged and absorbed costs to maintain market share or due to customer pushback. This is consistent with the expected answer and even elaborates it with many examples.\n- However, the system answer does not mention the Chicago retail industry analyst or the expected timing of peak tariff impact in the first half of 2026, which is a specific fact in the ground truth.\n- There are no clear factual contradictions with the ground truth; it is just more detailed and broader in scope, but it omits that Chicago timing detail.\n\nBecause a key detail from the expected answer (the Chicago 2026 timing) is missing, but the rest of the required content is correctly covered without errors, the answer is incomplete yet accurate for what it does contain.",

      "question": "What was the relationship between federal policy and electric vehicle sales, and how did this affect overall auto sales?",
      "expected_answer": "Auto sales were boosted in some districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September. However, in the Chicago District, light vehicle sales declined overall, especially for EVs following the end of federal tax credits. This shows the federal tax credit created a pre-expiration demand surge followed by a post-expiration decline.",
      "system_answer": "Federal policy—specifically a federal electric‑vehicle (EV) tax credit that was scheduled to expire at the end of September—caused a short, sharp pull‑forward of EV demand, and this, in turn, boosted or stabilized overall auto sales.\n\nHere is the cause‑and‑effect chain:\n\n1. **Federal policy created a time‑limited financial incentive**  \n   • The federal government offered a **tax credit for EV purchases**.  \n   • **This was scheduled to expire at the end of September.**  \n   • This impending expiration **caused households to accelerate EV purchases** to capture the credit before it disappeared. [National Summary, BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. **Impending expiration caused a “rush” or “surge” in EV sales**  \n   • In the **Atlanta District**, auto dealers reported a **“robust surge” in new EV sales** **because** buyers were trying to use the credit before it expired. This was **caused by** the looming end of the federal EV tax credit. [Atlanta, Consumer Spending]  \n   • In the **Philadelphia District**, contacts reported a **“rush to buy electric vehicles … before the expiration of a federal EV tax credit at the end of September.”** That rush was explicitly **caused by** the tax credit’s imminent end. [Philadelphia, Trade and Services]  \n   • In the **Chicago District**, new light vehicle sales were described as **“brisk,”** in part **because of the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases**—again indicating that the upcoming end of incentives **caused** consumers to move EV purchases forward. [Chicago, Consumer Spending]  \n   • The **National Summary** states that **“auto sales were boosted in some Districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September,”** confirming that the policy timing **caused** strong, time‑sensitive EV demand in multiple areas. [National Summary]\n\n3. **Stronger EV sales then affected overall auto sales**  \n   As a result of this tax‑credit‑driven surge in EV demand:\n\n   • **Boosting total auto sales where demand was otherwise soft or flat**  \n     – In **Atlanta**, the **robust surge in EV sales** contributed to stronger overall new vehicle sales than would otherwise have occurred. This was **caused by** the federal EV tax credit’s expiration window. [Atlanta, Consumer Spending]  \n     – In **Chicago**, **brisk new light vehicle sales** were **partly caused by** the end of EV tax incentives, showing that EV demand helped keep total auto sales elevated. [Chicago, Consumer Spending]\n\n   • **Offsetting declines in other vehicle categories**  \n     – In **Philadelphia**, auto dealers reported a **slight decrease** in overall auto sales, but said sales **“would have fallen by more”** **if not for** the rush to buy EVs before the federal tax credit expired. Here, **federal policy caused extra EV sales**, and **those extra EV sales caused the overall decline in auto sales to be smaller** than it otherwise would have been. [Philadelphia, Trade and Services]\n\n   • **Driving modest increases in some local markets**  \n     – In parts of the **Boston District** (e.g., New Hampshire), contacts noted that **overall auto sales increased modestly because of EV purchases ahead of tax‑credit expiration**. Thus, **federal policy caused an EV spike, which in turn caused a modest net rise in auto sales**. [Boston District, BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n   • **Nationally, propping up aggregate auto sales**  \n     – The Federal Reserve’s **national summary** notes that **auto sales were boosted in some Districts by strong EV demand ahead of the expiration of the federal tax credit**, meaning the policy **caused** EV demand to be time‑shifted into the current period and **as a result** temporarily propped up total auto sales, even as underlying consumer spending was softening. [National Summary]\n\n4. **Overall causal relationship**  \n   • **Federal EV tax credit and its scheduled expiration** → **created a clear, time‑bounded incentive**.  \n   • This **caused** consumers to **pull forward EV purchases** into the months just before the credit ended, leading to a **“rush” or “robust surge”** in EV sales in multiple Districts.  \n   • The surge in EV sales **caused** overall auto sales to be **higher or more stable** than they would have been:\n     – In some Districts, total auto sales were **boosted or described as “brisk.”**  \n     – In others, EV demand **softened or offset what would have been a steeper decline** in overall auto sales.  \n\nIn summary, the federal EV tax credit—and especially its impending expiration—directly **caused a temporary spike in EV purchases**, and this spike **in turn caused overall auto sales to be lifted or cushioned** across several Federal Reserve Districts, relative to a baseline in which the credit did not exist or was not about to expire.\n",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Federal EV tax credit expiration at end of September created a pre‑expiration surge in EV demand that boosted auto sales in some districts.\n2) In the Chicago District specifically, light vehicle sales declined overall after the end of the credit, with EVs declining especially.\n3) Therefore, the relationship shows a pre‑expiration demand surge followed by a post‑expiration decline.\n\nThe system answer:\n- Correctly describes that a federal EV tax credit scheduled to expire at the end of September led to a pull‑forward surge in EV sales and that this boosted or stabilized overall auto sales in several districts. That matches the first and third points of the expected answer (pre‑expiration surge, lift/cushioning of overall auto sales).\n- However, it does not mention the post‑expiration pattern at all: it omits that in the Chicago District light vehicle sales declined overall, \"especially for EVs following the end of federal tax credits,\" and it does not describe the post‑expiration decline as part of the relationship.\n- Moreover, the system answer actually characterizes Chicago as having \"brisk\" new light vehicle sales partly due to the end of incentives, but does not acknowledge the subsequent decline; this gives an incomplete picture relative to the expected answer’s emphasis on the drop after expiration.\n\nSo the answer has accurate but incomplete information: it gets the pre‑expiration surge and effect on auto sales, but fails to capture the key post‑expiration decline insight that the question and ground truth highlight, especially for Chicago. There are no clear factual contradictions to the ground truth, just missing the second half of the narrative.\n\nHence, it is partially correct, not fully correct.",

However, labor cost pressures intensified due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses. Additionally, some contacts in the Chicago District reported moderate increases in nonlabor costs including energy and higher prices for raw materials. This meant total compensation costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.",
      "system_answer": "Multiple factors affected labor costs, and they interacted with wage growth through several clear cause‑and‑effect channels.\n\n1. Wage growth as a baseline source of higher labor costs\n- Across all reporting Districts, **wages grew at a modest to moderate pace** [National Summary – Labor Markets]. \n- This was caused by generally muted but still positive demand for labor: employment was “largely stable” and labor demand “generally muted,” so firms had **some** need to raise pay to hire and retain workers, but not enough to trigger broad, rapid wage acceleration [National Summary – Labor Markets].\n- As a result, **base wages and salaries pushed labor costs up gradually everywhere**, providing a steady but not dominant source of cost pressure.\n\n2. Employer‑sponsored health insurance and benefits sharply amplified labor costs\n- Nationally, **labor cost pressures intensified “due to outsized increases in employer‑sponsored health insurance expenses”**, even though wage gains were only modest to moderate [National Summary – Labor Markets].\n- This was caused by **rapid increases in health‑care and insurance premiums**, documented across several Districts:\n  - Chicago contacts “cited increases in health insurance premiums” while reporting that wages and benefits were up only modestly [Chicago – Labor Markets].\n  - Minneapolis contacts noted “significant increases in electricity rates and employee health care premiums for the coming year” [Minneapolis – Prices].\n  - A Dallas professional and business services firm reported that **health‑care and business insurance premiums were rising faster than revenues** [Dallas – Prices].\n  - Philadelphia businesses reported continued cost pressures from “insurance, health care, and utilities,” including a nearly **10 percent rise in health‑care costs** and a **15 percent increase in a liability insurance policy** [Philadelphia – Prices].\n- As a result, **total labor costs rose faster than wages alone**:\n  - Even where wages were only inching up, employers’ per‑employee cost jumped because benefit costs, especially health insurance, were rising at an **outsized** pace.\n  - Firms could experience “intensified labor cost pressures” **without** granting large pay raises, simply because the non‑wage component of compensation was escalating rapidly.\n\n3. Labor supply constraints (especially from immigration policy) raised effective labor costs\n- In several sectors and regions, **labor supply was strained** by immigration‑related factors:\n  - Nationally, “labor supply in the hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing sectors was reportedly strained in several Districts due to recent changes to immigration policies” [National Summary – Labor Markets].\n  - In Chicago, one contact said **fear of immigration enforcement** was reducing labor availability, and another reported that **revoked visas** for workers at a local factory forced the firm to rehire for those positions [Chicago – Labor Markets].\n  - In New York, some firms in **construction and leisure and hospitality** had difficulty finding workers “due to shifts in immigration policy” [New York – Labor Markets].\n- This was caused by **policy changes and enforcement actions** that reduced the pool of available (often foreign‑born) workers.\n- As a result, in affected sectors and locations:\n  - Employers had to **compete more intensely** for a smaller pool of workers, which put **upward pressure on wages and/or benefits** in those niches, even while average wage growth remained modest.\n  - Firms incurred **higher effective labor costs per unit of output** through:\n    - Overtime premiums paid to existing staff to cover unfilled positions.\n    - Extra recruiting, onboarding, and training costs to replace workers who lost visas or left due to enforcement fears.\n    - Delays and lower productivity (e.g., construction delays), which raised the labor cost embedded in each unit of work completed.\n  - Thus, immigration‑driven shortages **tightened local labor markets** and **raised labor costs**, even though the national wage data described only modest overall growth.\n\n4. Sector‑specific wage dynamics intensified cost pressures in some industries\n- In the New York District, **wage growth was particularly strong** in:\n  - **Construction**\n  - **Leisure and hospitality**\n  - **Wholesale**\n  - **Education**\n  while wage growth slowed to a slight pace in **finance** [New York – Labor Markets].\n- This was caused by relatively stronger labor demand and scarcer supply in those sectors, sometimes interacting with immigration constraints (e.g., construction, leisure and hospitality).\n- As a result:\n  - **Labor costs in those New York industries rose faster** than in sectors with weaker wage growth such as finance.\n  - Firms in those sectors faced a double effect: **higher wages plus rising benefit costs**, amplifying total labor cost increases compared with the broader modest national pattern.\n\n5. Other non‑labor and overhead costs shaped how firms responded to wage pressures\n- Businesses also faced **robust increases in non‑labor operating costs**:\n  - In Cleveland, “nonlabor input costs rose at a robust pace,” driven by tariffs on raw materials, imported components, and chemicals; higher costs for goods like vehicles, beef, coffee, and chocolate; and elevated technology, insurance, and utilities costs [Cleveland – Prices].\n  - Philadelphia contacts mentioned ongoing pressures from “tariffs, insurance, health care, and utilities” [Philadelphia – Prices].\n  - Minneapolis noted higher electricity rates as well as employee health‑care premiums [Minneapolis – Prices].\n- This was caused by a combination of **tariffs, higher commodity prices, utility rate increases, and more expensive business and liability insurance**.\n- As a result, these broader cost pressures **constrained how far firms were willing or able to raise wages**:\n  - Many firms kept **wage increases modest**, even as total labor costs were rising, because profits were already being squeezed by higher benefits and non‑labor inputs.\n  - The Beige Book does not quote firms explicitly saying they hired at minimum wage or froze wages for this reason, but the pattern—modest wage growth alongside rapidly rising benefits and other costs—indicates that **wage restraint was one tool** to manage overall cost escalation.\n\n6. Muted labor demand and economic uncertainty tempered wage growth\n- Nationally, “demand for labor was generally muted,” and more employers reported **lowering headcounts through layoffs and attrition**, citing **weaker demand and elevated economic uncertainty** [National Summary – Labor Markets].\n- In Chicago, an employment agency reported a “continued decline in demand from manufacturers,” previously announced layoffs in agricultural machinery manufacturing had been completed, and a retail analyst expected **weaker holiday hiring** than the prior year [Chicago – Labor Markets].\n- This was caused by **softer product and service demand** and heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.\n- As a result:\n  - **Wage growth was held in check** in many areas because firms had less need to bid aggressively for workers.\n  - Even as benefit costs (especially health insurance) rose sharply, subdued hiring and some layoffs kept **aggregate wage pressures modest**, reinforcing the pattern of **rising total labor costs without commensurate wage surges**.\n\n7. Technology and AI investment reduced headcount and altered labor‑cost dynamics\n- The National Summary notes that **more employers lowered head counts through layoffs and attrition**, and that in some cases they cited **increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies** as a reason [National Summary – Labor Markets].\n- This was caused by firms adopting AI and related technologies to automate tasks, especially in an environment of weaker demand and rising costs.\n- As a result:\n  - Some firms **reduced total headcount**, which lowered aggregate labor costs **even if wages per remaining worker were rising modestly**.\n  - Technology thus acted as an **offsetting force**: per‑worker costs (wages plus benefits) went up, but fewer workers were employed in some firms, limiting or reversing growth in the firm’s overall wage bill.\n\n8. Combined effect on profits and pricing\n- When modest wage growth combined with **outsized increases in health‑care and insurance costs**, plus higher tariffs and utilities, firms’ cost structures were squeezed.\n- This was caused by the **stacking** of multiple cost drivers:\n  - Base wages up modestly.\n  - Benefits (especially health insurance) up sharply.\n  - Non‑labor inputs (tariffs, technology, electricity, insurance) also rising.\n- As a result:\n  - In some cases (e.g., the northern Minnesota resort described elsewhere in the Beige Book), **net income fell** because higher labor and overhead costs were not matched by revenue growth.\n  - More generally, firms faced pressure either to **raise prices** (where demand allowed) or to **cut elsewhere** (hiring restraint, reduced headcount, or tighter wage increases) to protect margins.\n\nPutting it together: how the factors and wage growth interacted\n- **Modest wage growth** steadily increased labor costs but, by itself, did not create extreme pressure.\n- **Outsized increases in employer‑sponsored health insurance and other benefits** caused labor cost pressures to **intensify beyond what wage growth alone would imply**.\n- **Immigration‑related labor shortages** in sectors like hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing made it harder to hire, which **pushed wages and effective labor costs higher in those niches**, even as overall wage growth remained modest.\n- **Rising tariffs, utilities, and insurance** further squeezed firms, leading many to **contain wage growth** despite feeling higher total labor costs.\n- **Muted labor demand and economic uncertainty** acted in the opposite direction, **dampening wage acceleration** and encouraging some firms to reduce headcount or delay hiring.\n- **Technology and AI adoption** allowed some firms to cut headcount, partially offsetting rising per‑worker costs.\n\nAs a result, the October 2025 Beige Book evidence shows that total labor costs were the product of **multiple interacting forces**: wages rising modestly, benefits (especially health insurance) rising sharply, sector‑ and policy‑driven labor shortages raising costs in some areas, and demand and technology developments restraining broader wage growth and employment. Wage growth was an important but **not dominant** driver; non‑wage and structural factors often played the leading role in pushing overall labor costs higher.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key points from the expected answer:\n1) Wages grew at a modest to moderate pace across all districts.\n2) Labor cost pressures intensified mainly due to outsized increases in employer‑sponsored health insurance expenses.\n3) Some Chicago contacts reported moderate increases in nonlabor costs (energy, raw materials, etc.).\n4) Therefore, total compensation costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.\n\nNow compare with the system answer:\n- It clearly states that wages grew at a modest to moderate pace across all districts (matches point 1).\n- It explicitly highlights that labor cost pressures intensified due to outsized increases in employer‑sponsored health insurance expenses, and repeatedly emphasizes that benefit costs, especially health insurance, rose sharply (matches point 2).\n- It discusses other non‑labor and overhead costs (tariffs, utilities, insurance, raw materials) affecting firms’ cost structure and constraining wage growth. While the specific example of “energy and higher prices for raw materials in Chicago” is not named exactly as in the ground truth, the answer does include similar content about non‑labor input costs and even attributes some of it to specific districts (e.g., Cleveland, Philadelphia, Minneapolis). This does not contradict the ground truth; it is simply more detailed and uses somewhat different district examples.\n- It explicitly draws the conclusion that total labor costs (compensation) were rising faster than wages alone would suggest: e.g., “total labor costs rose faster than wages alone” and that labor cost pressures intensified even with modest wage growth (matches point 4).\n\nThe system answer adds many additional factors (immigration‑driven labor shortages, sector‑specific wage dynamics, technology/AI, muted demand, etc.). These go well beyond the minimal ground‑truth description, but they do not contradict any of the key facts in the expected answer. There are no clear factual errors relative to the expected answer; the extra detail is not disallowed by the instructions, which only require that all key facts from the expected answer be present and accurate and that no contradictions appear.\n\nAll core elements are present and correctly characterized, and the answer’s additional elaborations are consistent with the expected narrative, even if more expansive.\n\nTherefore the answer is fully correct relative to the ground truth, not merely partial.",

      "question": "How did consumer spending patterns affect different restaurant segments in the Chicago District?",
      "expected_answer": "In the Chicago District, leisure and hospitality sales were mixed, with softness in some travel-related categories including airlines and hotels, but increased spending at restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments. Demand from restaurant groups remained solid, as indicated by commercial real estate leasing activity.",
      "system_answer": "Consumer spending patterns in the Chicago District created clear winners within restaurants and relative softness in other parts of leisure and hospitality.\n\n1. **Modest overall spending increase → selective strength in restaurants**  \n   • Consumer spending in the Chicago District **increased modestly over the reporting period**.  \n   • This was caused by households spending a bit more overall, which, in turn, **channeled some of that additional spending into restaurants**. As a result, certain restaurant segments recorded higher sales.\n\n2. **Segment-specific gains in restaurants**  \n   • District contacts reported **“increased spending at restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments.”** [BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago > Consumer Spending]  \n   • This was caused by consumers directing more of their discretionary food-away-from-home dollars to these particular formats during the period.  \n   • As a result, **fast food, fast casual, and family dining restaurants outperformed other parts of leisure and hospitality**, showing clear gains in sales.\n\n3. **Mixed leisure and hospitality overall → contrast with airlines and hotels**  \n   • The Beige Book describes leisure and hospitality sales in the Chicago District as **“mixed,”** with **“softness in some travel-related categories, including airlines and hotels.”**  \n   • This was caused by consumers **pulling back on higher-cost travel and lodging**, even as they continued to spend at certain types of restaurants.  \n   • As a result, **airlines and hotels experienced weaker demand**, while **restaurants—specifically fast food, fast casual, and family dining—saw increased spending** over the same period.  \n   • This contrast shows that **the same consumer spending environment produced opposite effects** across segments: it **hurt travel-related services** but **boosted specific restaurant categories**.\n\n4. **Effects on full-service / higher-end restaurants (what we can and cannot infer)**  \n   • The Chicago section **does not mention full-service, higher-end, or fine-dining restaurants at all**, nor does it say they were weak or strong.  \n   • Therefore, we **cannot causally claim** from this report that rising spending at fast food, fast casual, and family dining was caused by a shift away from full-service or fine dining, or that those higher-end segments suffered.  \n   • All we can say is:  \n     – Consumer spending patterns **clearly boosted** fast food, fast casual, and family dining.  \n     – The report is **silent** on how full-service or upscale restaurants fared, so any claimed cause‑and‑effect there would be speculative.\n\n5. **Relative differences across restaurant segments**  \n   • Because the Beige Book only explicitly identifies **fast food, fast casual, and family dining** as seeing increased spending, the **relative effect** of consumer spending patterns across restaurant segments is:  \n     – **Positive effect**: Fast food, fast casual, and family dining experienced **higher spending**, caused by modestly stronger consumer outlays directed toward these formats.  \n     – **Unknown effect**: Other restaurant formats (e.g., traditional full-service, upscale) are not discussed, so their performance **cannot be tied causally to the spending patterns described**.  \n   • As a result, the **clearest, documented divergence** is not between different restaurant types, but **between these gaining restaurant segments and the weaker travel-related categories** within leisure and hospitality.\n\nIn summary, modestly higher overall consumer spending in the Chicago District **caused** a measurable boost specifically for fast food, fast casual, and family dining restaurants, while **at the same time causing** mixed conditions in leisure and hospitality overall, with **softness in airlines and hotels**. The Beige Book does not provide enough evidence to say how full-service or higher-end restaurants were affected, so no additional causal claims about those segments are supported by this source.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Leisure and hospitality sales in the Chicago District were mixed.\n2) There was softness in some travel-related categories, including airlines and hotels.\n3) There was increased spending at restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments.\n4) Demand from restaurant groups remained solid, as indicated by commercial real estate leasing activity.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer explicitly states that leisure and hospitality sales were \"mixed\" and notes \"softness in some travel-related categories, including airlines and hotels\" – matching points (1) and (2).\n- It also clearly mentions \"increased spending at restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments\" and describes these as outperforming other parts of leisure and hospitality – matching point (3).\n- The only element missing is the reference to demand from restaurant groups being solid as evidenced by commercial real estate leasing activity; the system answer does not mention leasing or CRE at all.\n- There are no factual contradictions with the expected answer; the additional commentary about what can/cannot be inferred about full‑service or fine dining is cautious and not incorrect.\n\nBecause the answer accurately covers the core pattern of how spending affected different restaurant segments and their contrast with other leisure/hospitality categories, but omits the leasing-activity detail, it is accurate but slightly incomplete relative to the full expected answer.\n\nThus, the best classification is PARTIALLY_CORRECT rather than fully CORRECT due to that missing key detail about leasing/demand from restaurant groups.",

      "question": "How did lower interest rates affect different interest rate-sensitive sectors across districts?",
      "expected_answer": "Lower interest rates had positive effects across multiple sectors: In Cleveland, commercial construction and financial services saw uptick in demand due to lower rates. In Chicago, financial conditions loosened modestly with business loan volumes increasing. However, the impact was mixed - while some reports noted improved business lending, residential real estate remained weak in Dallas and home sales were flat in Boston. The housing market's response to lower rates was more muted than commercial sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Across districts, lower interest rates produced **uneven and often weak** responses in the main interest‑sensitive sectors—residential and commercial real estate, and (where documented) financial services and construction. Where possible, the Beige Book explicitly states the cause‑and‑effect link; elsewhere, it emphasizes that other forces dominated.\n\nBelow, effects are organized by sector and district, making the causal chain explicit.\n\n---\n## 1. Residential real estate: lower rates often *failed* to spark activity\n\n### Boston (First District)\n- **Observed outcomes:**\n  - Single‑family home sales were “flat or down slightly overall,” though they rose in northern New England; condo sales “increased slightly” on average, with variation by state. Inventories rose sharply; single‑family prices increased moderately and some condo prices fell modestly. [Boston > Residential Real Estate]\n- **Role of interest rates:**\n  - Contacts were “hopeful that mortgage rates might fall in the coming months, potentially improving affordability and sales.” [Boston > Residential Real Estate]\n- **Cause–effect:**\n  - **Because mortgage rates had not yet fallen meaningfully**, the report shows **no realized boost in activity** attributable to lower rates during the period.\n  - Instead, **expectations of possible future rate declines caused contacts to hope for future improvements** in affordability and sales, but these hopes had not yet translated into stronger current sales.\n\n### Dallas (Eleventh District)\n- **Observed outcomes:**\n  - “Housing market activity remained weak,” with “choppy and lackluster” foot traffic and sales, elevated inventories, and slowing home starts; builders depended on incentives and mortgage‑rate buydowns to close deals, and outlooks were pessimistic. [Dallas > Construction and Real Estate]\n- **Explicit rate link:**\n  - Weakness persisted “**despite the recent dip in mortgage rates**.” [Dallas > Construction and Real Estate]\n- **Cause–effect:**\n  - **Lower mortgage rates did not cause a meaningful rebound in housing demand.** \n  - Instead, other factors—such as buyer caution, elevated inventory, and the need for incentives—kept activity weak **even though rates had moved down**, so lower rates **failed to trigger** the typical pickup in this interest‑sensitive sector.\n\n### San Francisco (Twelfth District)\n- **Observed outcomes:**\n  - “Residential real estate activity decreased somewhat.” Demand for new and existing single‑family homes fell; homes stayed on the market longer; inventories rose; developers offered more incentives. New residential construction “remained limited,” with lower demand from potential buyers, and backlogs shortened, raising competition for work. [San Francisco > Real Estate and Construction]\n- **Rate linkage:**\n  - The passage **does not attribute these declines to interest rates**; it simply describes weakening conditions.\n- **Cause–effect:**\n  - **Despite an environment of generally lower policy rates**, residential demand in this district **declined**. \n  - This suggests that **other forces (e.g., weaker demand, affordability constraints, or local conditions) outweighed any supportive effect of lower rates**, so lower rates **did not cause an upswing** in this interest‑sensitive sector.\n\n### New York (Second District)\n- **Observed outcomes:**\n  - Housing markets “remained solid,” with low inventory, rising prices, and desirable properties selling quickly, often above asking. [New York > Real Estate and Construction]\n- **Rate linkage:**\n  - The report **does not connect** these conditions to lower interest rates.\n- **Cause–effect:**\n  - **Tight supply and strong demand, rather than lower rates, appear to be the main drivers** of outcomes described. The Beige Book does not claim that lower rates caused this strength, so a direct rate‑effect cannot be inferred from the text.\n\n### Cleveland (Fourth District) – residential side\n- **Observed outcomes:**\n  - Residential real estate and construction contacts reported **declining demand** in recent weeks, and many homeowners were reluctant to sell because they already held low mortgage rates; on balance, they expected **flat demand** ahead. [Cleveland > Real Estate and Construction]\n- **Cause–effect:**\n  - **Previously locked‑in low mortgage rates caused many homeowners to stay put**, which **limited new listings and transactions** even as policy rates were lower currently.\n  - As a result, **lower current interest rates did not translate into higher residential activity**; instead, the legacy of past low rates **suppressed mobility** and kept demand subdued.\n\n**Net effect in residential real estate:**  \nAcross Boston, Dallas, San Francisco, New York, and Cleveland, **lower rates generally did not yet cause a broad-based acceleration in housing activity**. In some places (Dallas, San Francisco, Cleveland), activity weakened or stayed weak **despite** lower or dipping rates; in Boston and New York, conditions were driven more by inventories and local demand than by realized rate effects, with only **expectations** of future rate cuts noted as potentially supportive.\n\n---\n## 2. Commercial real estate and construction: clearer positives in some districts, but not uniformly due to rates\n\n### Cleveland (Fourth District) – commercial construction and financial services\n- **Observed outcomes:**\n  - “Commercial construction and financial services contacts noted an **uptick in demand because of lower interest rates**.” [National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Cleveland; Cleveland > Summary of Economic Activity]\n  - Contacts expected overall activity to “increase modestly in the months ahead.” [Cleveland > Summary of Economic Activity]\n- **Cause–effect:**\n  - **Lower interest rates directly caused stronger demand** in two interest‑sensitive areas:\n    - Commercial construction projects became more attractive to finance.\n    - Financial services (loan and related demand) increased as borrowing costs fell.\n  - These lower borrowing costs **led contacts to anticipate modest further gains**, though not a “sharp” jump, in coming months.\n\n### Boston (First District) – commercial real estate and construction\n- **Observed outcomes:**\n  - Commercial real estate activity was “up slightly net of seasonal factors,” with a seasonal uptick in leasing after Labor Day and the market “buoyed by some large office deals.” Office rents were flat with rising operating costs; retail and industrial activity were stable; apartment rents rose only slightly, a slowdown. [Boston > Commercial Real Estate]\n  - Construction “remained limited” as “construction costs continued to face upward pressure from tariffs and labor shortages.” [Boston > Commercial Real Estate]\n  - “The recent reduction in the federal funds rate lifted sentiment somewhat,” though pessimism about rents lingered. [Boston > Commercial Real Estate]\n- **Cause–effect:**\n  - **The reduction in the federal funds rate caused an improvement in sentiment among commercial real estate contacts**, making the outlook “cautiously optimistic.”\n  - However, **high construction costs caused by tariffs and labor shortages, not interest rates, constrained actual construction activity**, so **lower rates did not translate into a construction boom**.\n\n### New York (Second District) – commercial real estate vs. construction\n- **Observed outcomes:**\n  - “Commercial real estate markets continue to improve,” while “construction activity continued to decline.” [New York > Real Estate and Construction]\n  - Industrial activity was muted in part due to “uncertainty around interest rates.” [New York > Real Estate and Construction]\n- **Cause–effect:**\n  - **Improving CRE markets were not explicitly tied to lower rates**; instead, the text highlights sectoral variation.\n  - **Uncertainty about the path of interest rates contributed to muted industrial sector activity**, suggesting that **rate uncertainty, rather than the level of rates per se, dampened some investment and construction decisions**.\n  - As a result, even as CRE fundamentals improved, **construction continued to fall**, indicating that **lower or changing rates did not cause an expansion in building activity** here.\n\n### Dallas (Eleventh District) – commercial real estate\n- **Observed outcomes:**\n  - “Commercial real estate activity improved.” Apartment demand was steady but competitive due to high new supply; office leasing improved with more signs of stability; industrial and retail activity remained solid. Investment sales were limited, and firms favored short‑term leases amid uncertainty. [Dallas > Construction and Real Estate]\n- **Rate linkage:**\n  - The report **does not attribute** these improvements directly to lower rates.\n- **Cause–effect:**\n  - **Improvement in CRE activity was driven by local leasing dynamics and sector‑specific factors**, with short‑term leases and limited investment sales reflecting broader uncertainty.\n  - The Beige Book does **not state** that lower rates caused this improvement, so any such link would be speculative.\n\n---\n## 3. Financial services and lending: clear rate effect in Cleveland, mixed or unclear elsewhere\n\n### Cleveland (Fourth District)\n- **Observed outcomes:**\n  - Financial services contacts “noted an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates.” [National Summary > Cleveland; Cleveland > Summary of Economic Activity]\n  - Contacts expected activity to **increase modestly** going forward. [Cleveland > Summary of Economic Activity]\n- **Cause–effect:**\n  - **Lower interest rates reduced borrowing costs, causing higher loan and financial‑product demand.**\n  - This rate‑driven demand **led contacts to anticipate modest further gains**, making Cleveland the clearest case where lower rates **directly boosted an interest‑sensitive financial sector**.\n\n### Kansas City (Tenth District)\n- **Observed outcomes:**\n  - Economic activity “fell slightly”; employment slipped; “bankers noted consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately.” [Kansas City > Summary of Economic Activity]\n- **Rate linkage:**\n  - The report **does not associate** this deterioration with the level of interest rates or recent rate cuts.\n- **Cause–effect:**\n  - **Softening regional economic conditions caused some deterioration in consumer loan portfolios**, signaling stress in household credit.\n  - There is **no evidence** that lower rates were causing either an offsetting rise in new consumer borrowing or a clear improvement in loan performance.\n\n### Other districts (business lending generally)\n- The national Beige Book notes **some reports of improved business lending due to lower interest rates**, but the provided excerpts **do not identify which districts** those reports came from.\n- Likewise, while some districts were described nationally as still having “muted” activity, the new passages **do not explicitly tie that muted lending or real estate activity to lower rates** on a district‑by‑district basis.\n- As a result:\n  - Claims that particular districts (e.g., Atlanta, Philadelphia) had specific lending responses **because of** lower rates **cannot be supported from the provided text** and must be withdrawn or generalized.\n\n---\n## 4. Cross‑district variation in responsiveness to lower rates\n\nPulling the strands together:\n\n1. **Districts where lower rates clearly caused a positive response in interest‑sensitive sectors**\n   - **Cleveland (Fourth District):**\n     - **Commercial construction and financial services:** Both sectors **explicitly reported an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates**. Lower borrowing costs directly **stimulated new projects and financial activity**, and contacts expected modest further gains.\n     - **Residential real estate:** In contrast, **legacy low mortgage rates on existing loans caused homeowners to stay put**, suppressing listings and transactions, so **current lower policy rates did not cause stronger residential activity**.\n   - **Boston (First District) – sentiment channel only:**\n     - The **reduction in the federal funds rate caused an improvement in commercial real estate sentiment**, making contacts more optimistic, but **construction remained constrained by high costs**, so the tangible activity response was limited.\n\n2. **Districts where interest‑sensitive sectors remained weak or mixed despite lower rates**\n   - **Dallas (Eleventh District):**\n     - **Residential real estate remained weak “despite the recent dip in mortgage rates,”** showing that **lower rates did not cause a turnaround in housing demand**.\n     - **Commercial real estate activity improved**, but this improvement was **not attributed to lower rates**, and investment activity remained cautious amid uncertainty.\n   - **San Francisco (Twelfth District):**\n     - **Residential demand and construction decreased** even in a lower‑rate environment, indicating that **other factors (lower buyer demand, extended time on market, competition among builders) outweighed any support from lower rates**.\n   - **New York (Second District):**\n     - CRE markets improved, but **construction activity continued to decline**, and industrial activity was **muted by uncertainty around interest rates**, implying that **rate uncertainty, not lower rates themselves, dampened investment**.\n\n3. **Districts where the role of lower rates is unclear from the excerpts**\n   - **Kansas City:** Deterioration in consumer loan portfolios was reported, but without any stated connection to rate changes.\n   - **Other districts (e.g., Atlanta, Philadelphia) referenced in earlier drafts:** The new evidence **does not provide text tying their lending or real‑estate outcomes to lower rates**, so **no causal claims can be supported** from the material at hand.\n\n---\n## 5. Overall causal story\n\n- **Where explicit links exist (notably Cleveland and parts of Boston), lower interest rates caused increased demand or better sentiment in some interest‑sensitive sectors**—especially commercial construction and financial services in Cleveland, and CRE sentiment in Boston.\n- **In residential real estate across multiple districts (Boston, Dallas, San Francisco, Cleveland), lower or dipping rates did not reliably cause stronger housing activity.** Other forces—locked‑in past low mortgage rates, weak buyer demand, high prices, or construction cost pressures—often dominated.\n- **In New York, uncertainty about the future path of interest rates caused some industrial and construction activity to remain muted**, even as CRE fundamentals improved.\n- **Nationally, while some contacts reported better business lending due to lower rates, the available district‑level excerpts do not allow a full, district‑by‑district causal mapping.**\n\nThus, the main pattern is that **lower interest rates had clear, positive causal effects in a few commercial and financial segments (especially in Cleveland), but their impact on broader interest‑sensitive sectors—most notably housing and construction—was often dampened or overshadowed by other local and structural factors, leading to very uneven responsiveness across districts.**",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements of the expected answer:\n1) Lower rates had clear positive effects in some sectors and places, especially:\n   - Cleveland: uptick in commercial construction and financial services demand due to lower rates.\n   - Chicago: modest loosening of financial conditions with increased business loan volumes.\n2) The overall impact was mixed:\n   - Some reports noted improved business lending.\n   - Residential real estate remained weak in Dallas.\n   - Home sales were flat in Boston.\n   - Housing’s response was more muted than commercial sectors.\n\nCheck against the system answer:\n- Cleveland: The system clearly and correctly states that in Cleveland, commercial construction and financial services contacts reported an “uptick in demand because of lower interest rates.” This matches the ground truth.\n- Mixed/uneven impact across sectors: The system heavily emphasizes that responses were uneven and often weak, and that residential real estate often failed to respond to lower rates. It explicitly covers Dallas (housing activity weak despite a dip in mortgage rates) and Boston (home sales flat/down slightly; only sentiment affected), which matches the ground truth characterization.\n- Housing vs commercial: The system stresses that residential real estate’s response was generally muted, while commercial construction/financial services in Cleveland saw clear positive responses. That aligns with the expected answer’s point that housing’s response was more muted than commercial sectors.\n- Dallas: The system correctly notes that housing activity remained weak despite lower mortgage rates.\n- Boston: The system describes single‑family sales as flat or down slightly and notes only a sentiment channel from rate cuts for commercial real estate, consistent with “home sales were flat in Boston.”\n\nMissing/incorrect elements:\n- Chicago: The expected answer specifically notes that in Chicago, financial conditions loosened modestly with increasing business loan volumes. The system answer does not mention Chicago at all, so it omits this key district‑level effect.\n- The system also introduces many additional districts and nuance. That’s acceptable as long as it’s not wrong, and nothing obviously contradicts the ground truth. But because Chicago’s effect is a core part of the expected answer and is entirely missing, the answer is incomplete.\n\nThere are no clear factual contradictions with the ground truth; the issue is omission, not wrong facts. Therefore, the answer is accurate on what it covers, but not fully complete relative to the expected answer.\n",

      "question": "How did federal funding changes affect employment in specific sectors?",
      "expected_answer": "Federal funding changes negatively impacted employment across multiple sectors: In Boston, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in education and health-care sectors. In Cleveland, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to federal grant uncertainty. In New York, nonprofits faced challenges from reduced federal benefit programs, with community health-care centers reporting financial strain. Manufacturing employment in Boston was mixed, with one firm shedding workers to offset tariff-related cost increases.",
      "system_answer": "Federal funding changes affected employment mainly in sectors that depend heavily on federal grants, and the Beige Book evidence shows clear cause‑effect chains.\n\n1. **Education and health care (Boston District)**  \n   - **Cause:** The Boston Fed reports that there were “**cuts to federal grant funding**.” [BeigeBook_20251015, Boston > Labor Markets]  \n   - **Mechanism:** Education and health‑care providers rely on federal grants to cover operating budgets. When those grants were cut, organizations faced budget gaps. This was caused by lower expected or realized federal revenue, which forced institutions to reduce labor costs.  \n   - **Effect:** “Cuts to federal grant funding **contributed to layoffs in the education and health‑care sectors**.” [BeigeBook_20251015, Boston > Labor Markets] As a result, employment in these grant‑dependent sectors fell, even though “employment was flat overall” in the Boston District because other sectors (e.g., IT services) saw modest gains or stability.\n\n2. **Nonprofit sector (Cleveland District)**  \n   - **Cause:** A semiannual survey of Cleveland‑area nonprofits found “a growing share of respondents indicated that **funding … decreased over the past six months**,” and there was explicit “**uncertainty around federal grants**.” [BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Community Conditions]  \n   - **Mechanism:** Nonprofits plan staffing based on expected grant income. This was caused by concern that future federal grants might be reduced or not renewed; to avoid being over‑staffed if funds fell short, organizations conserved cash and limited hiring. One respondent even reported drawing on reserve funds to cover operating expenses.  \n   - **Effect:** “The nonprofit sector was **not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants**.” [BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Community Conditions] As a result, employment growth in the nonprofit sector was held down—not primarily through layoffs, but through **hiring freezes and unfilled vacancies**.\n\n3. **Contrast with less grant‑dependent sectors**  \n   - **Cause:** Sectors like IT services in Boston and, in other districts, wholesale, finance, and business services are less reliant on federal grant flows and more on private demand. Their budgets were not directly squeezed by federal grant cuts.  \n   - **Effect:** As a result, these sectors showed **modest increases or stability in employment** over the same reporting period, while grant‑dependent sectors (education, health care, nonprofits) experienced layoffs or constrained hiring. For instance, in Boston, “employment in IT services increased modestly” even as education and health care cut jobs. [BeigeBook_20251015, Boston > Labor Markets]\n\n4. **General mechanism linking funding to employment**  \n   Across the documented cases, the pathway is consistent:\n   - **Change in federal funding (cuts or uncertainty)** → organizations revise revenue expectations downward.  \n   - This was caused by either explicit reductions in grant awards (Boston) or anticipated risk that grants might not be maintained (Cleveland).  \n   - **Budget response:** To keep budgets balanced, organizations reduce labor costs—either by **laying off workers** (Boston education and health care) or by **not filling vacancies and slowing hiring** (Cleveland nonprofits).  \n   - **Employment outcome:** As a result, employment declines or grows more slowly in the sectors **most dependent on federal grants**, while sectors with little grant exposure are less affected and can maintain or increase employment if underlying demand is solid.\n\n5. **Limits and what we cannot infer**  \n   - The Beige Book **does not specify** which exact grant programs, agencies, or dollar amounts were involved, nor the number of jobs affected.  \n   - For the New York, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia Districts, the provided excerpts do **not** document a direct causal link between federal funding changes and sectoral employment; any cross‑district chain (e.g., cuts in one district causing declines in another) would go beyond the evidence.  \n   - Thus, we can say that **within** districts like Boston and Cleveland, federal grant cuts or uncertainty caused weaker employment in education, health care, and nonprofits, but we cannot quantify those effects precisely or generalize them to all districts from this evidence alone.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements of the expected answer:\n- Boston: cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in education and health‑care sectors.\n- Cleveland: nonprofit sector was not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants.\n- New York: nonprofits faced challenges from reduced federal benefit programs; community health‑care centers reported financial strain.\n- Boston manufacturing: mixed; one firm shedding workers to offset tariff-related cost increases.\n\nAssessment of system answer:\n- Boston education and health care: Correct. The system explicitly states that cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in education and health‑care sectors in Boston, matching the ground truth.\n- Cleveland nonprofits: Correct. It correctly describes that nonprofits were not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants and characterizes this as hiring freezes/unfilled vacancies.\n- New York nonprofits and community health‑care centers: Missing. The system explicitly says that for New York (and others) the excerpts do not document a direct causal link and does not mention reduced federal benefit programs or community health‑care centers’ financial strain. That part of the expected answer is absent.\n- Boston manufacturing and tariffs: Missing. The system does not mention manufacturing employment in Boston or the example of a firm shedding workers to offset tariff-related cost increases.\n- No factual contradictions: The content it does provide about Boston and Cleveland is consistent with the expected answer and not misleading, but coverage is incomplete and it explicitly narrows scope rather than hallucinating.\n\nBecause it accurately covers some but not all key sectors/effects (omits New York nonprofits and Boston manufacturing), with no incorrect claims, the answer is incomplete but not wrong.",

      "question": "What specific factors contributed to economic uncertainty across different districts?",
      "expected_answer": "Multiple factors contributed to uncertainty: Tariff policy changes made planning difficult for manufacturers (noted in Chicago and across districts). Federal grant uncertainty affected nonprofits (Cleveland, New York, Boston). Policy uncertainty was a top business concern (Dallas). Immigration policy changes created labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston). The potential for government shutdown was highlighted as a downside risk. Kansas City noted that despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic.",
      "system_answer": "Across districts, economic uncertainty stemmed from several distinct but related causes that affected households, firms, and specific sectors. Below, each factor is linked to the type of uncertainty it created and the resulting behaviors.\n\n1. **Rising prices and cost pressures → Household and business strain, weaker demand, and delays in decisions**  \n- **Boston – low- and moderate-income households:** Rising consumer prices, including those linked to tariffs, increased basic living costs. This was caused by higher input and consumer prices feeding through to rent, food, and other essentials. As a result, low- and moderate-income households in the Boston District faced greater financial precarity and economic uncertainty, especially with concurrent policy risks to safety-net programs (SNAP and Medicaid) and worsening workforce housing shortages amid rising construction costs. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- **Cleveland – manufacturers and retailers:** In the Cleveland District, nonlabor input costs rose at a robust pace, and tariffs were frequently cited as drivers of these cost increases across industries (raw materials, imported components, chemical inputs). This was caused by import tariffs raising the cost of many inputs. As a result, manufacturers faced tighter margins, struggled to plan pricing, and reported flat or weaker orders they attributed to import tariffs and persistent uncertainty about trade policy; one manufacturer said orders were about 25% below expectations. Retailers also reported tariff-driven cost increases on vehicles, beef, coffee, and chocolate, which, in turn, dragged down customer sentiment and added uncertainty about future sales volumes. [BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Manufacturing; Cleveland > Prices; Cleveland > Consumer Spending]  \n- **New York – manufacturers:** New York manufacturers reported that uncertainty relating to tariffs continued to weigh on them, as they faced elevated input prices and difficulty procuring some equipment and materials. This was caused by tariff-related hikes in input costs (for example, higher steel prices). As a result, one upstate keg manufacturer temporarily ceased production because steel had become too expensive, illustrating how cost shocks and availability issues can cause firms to halt or scale back operations and investment plans. [BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Manufacturing and Distribution]\n\n2. **Tariffs and trade-policy uncertainty → Weaker orders, export declines, and production cuts**  \n- **Cleveland – manufacturing demand:** Manufacturers “continued to attribute flat or weaker orders to import tariffs and persistent uncertainty about trade policy.” This was caused by tariffs raising prices on traded goods and creating doubt about future trade rules and demand. As a result, firms selling into industrial and agricultural equipment production saw particularly weak demand and could not confidently forecast future orders, leading to greater caution around production and capital spending. [BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland > Manufacturing]  \n- **New York – exporters:** Some New York manufacturing contacts reported that overseas demand for U.S.-manufactured goods had dropped due to shifting international trade dynamics. This was caused by changing trade relationships and tariff regimes that made U.S. goods relatively more expensive or less competitive abroad. As a result, exporters faced reduced foreign orders, adding uncertainty about their sales pipelines and often making them hesitant to expand capacity or hiring. [BeigeBook_20251015, New York > Manufacturing and Distribution]  \n- **National manufacturing:** At the national level, manufacturing activity was challenged by “higher tariffs and waning overall demand.” This was caused by the combined effect of trade barriers and softer global and domestic demand. As a result, manufacturers nationally reported greater uncertainty about future production levels and investment plans. [BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary > Overall Economic Activity]\n\n3. **Weakening demand and cautious consumers → Pessimistic outlooks and reduced investment**  \n- **Dallas – broad business environment:** Firms in the Dallas District explicitly cited “weakening demand, domestic policy uncertainty, and inflation” as primary or top concerns. Weakening demand was caused by more cautious consumers and choppy spending patterns, particularly in interest-sensitive sectors like housing. As a result, businesses reported worsening outlooks and elevated economic uncertainty, leading them to scale back or delay expansion, hiring, and capital spending. [BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]  \n- **Dallas – housing market:** The housing market “remained weak,” with foot traffic and sales described as “choppy and lackluster” despite a recent dip in mortgage rates. This was caused by sluggish demand, elevated inventories, and consumer hesitancy. As a result, home starts slowed further, vacant developed lot supply was rising, and builders relied heavily on marketing, discounting, and mortgage-rate buydowns to close deals. Housing outlooks “remained pessimistic amid sluggish demand and elevated economic uncertainty,” indicating that weak demand directly fed into builders’ uncertainty about future activity. [BeigeBook_20251015, Dallas]  \n- **Minneapolis – consumer behavior:** In the Minneapolis District, general economic uncertainties made consumers more cautious, causing them to curtail discretionary spending such as vacations. This was caused by households’ concerns about prices, income prospects, and broader economic risks. As a result, consumer-facing businesses faced softer discretionary demand and more unpredictable revenue streams, heightening uncertainty about staffing and investment. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n4. **Policy uncertainty and safety-net risk → Heightened household and nonprofit vulnerability**  \n- **Boston – safety-net programs and housing:** For low- and moderate-income households in Boston, economic uncertainty was heightened by planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid, combined with workforce housing shortages and rising construction costs. This was caused by the prospect of reduced government support and limited affordable housing supply. As a result, households faced greater risk of income and housing instability, making their consumption and labor-force decisions more volatile and uncertain. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- **Dallas – domestic policy uncertainty:** Dallas firms specifically included domestic policy uncertainty among their top concerns. This was caused by unclear or changing government policies on trade, taxation, regulation, or spending. As a result, businesses hesitated to commit to long-term projects or hiring, since future operating conditions were hard to predict. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- **Chicago – nonprofits and social services:** In the Chicago District, nonprofits and social service organizations faced increased uncertainty due to rising operating costs (e.g., insurance), reduced income and donations, and the expectation that they would need to secure new funding and operate with smaller budgets. This was caused by higher expenses combined with weaker or less reliable revenue sources. As a result, these organizations confronted difficult decisions about staffing, program scope, and long-term planning, deepening uncertainty in the social services sector. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n5. **Sector-specific price swings (energy, agriculture, input markets) → Investment restraint and operational changes**  \n- **Kansas City – energy sector:** In the Kansas City District’s energy sector, falling natural gas prices, declining revenues and profits, and reduced capital expenditures contributed to uncertainty that restrained investment. This was caused by lower commodity prices undermining expected returns on drilling and related projects. As a result, energy firms were more hesitant to commit to new exploration or expansion, opting instead to cut or delay capital spending, which reinforced economic uncertainty in the regional energy supply chain. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- **National – agriculture, energy, transportation:** Nationally, “activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts.” This was caused by weaker demand and price pressures in these cyclical sectors. As a result, producers in these industries faced more volatile income streams and were more uncertain about future profitability, leading to postponed investments and hiring. [BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary > Overall Economic Activity]\n\n6. **Interest-rate and financial conditions → Muted activity in rate-sensitive sectors**  \n- **Real estate (national context, with district echoes):** The Beige Book noted that commercial and residential real estate remained “mixed,” with “muted activity” in interest rate–sensitive sectors. This was caused by higher financing costs and uncertainty about the future path of interest rates. As a result, developers and homebuyers were slower to initiate projects or purchases, and some districts (like Dallas) saw weak housing demand and elevated inventories, deepening uncertainty for builders and related industries. [BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]  \n\n7. **Broad price sensitivity and consumer belt-tightening → Uncertain sales for retailers and service providers**  \n- **Households nationally and by district:** The Beige Book reported that households—especially lower- and middle-income—were increasingly price sensitive and “seeking discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty.” This was caused by widespread inflation and stagnant or uncertain income growth. As a result, retailers and service providers struggled to predict demand and margins, since small price changes could significantly alter consumer behavior, reinforcing uncertainty in planning inventory, staffing, and pricing. [BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n\n8. **Cross-cutting effect: Uncertain demand, costs, and policy → Delayed hiring, production, and investment**  \nAcross multiple districts (Cleveland, New York, Atlanta, Dallas, and others), a common pattern emerged: when firms could not reliably forecast demand (because of tariffs, weaker overseas orders, or cautious consumers), could not predict costs (because of volatile input prices and tariffs), or faced unclear policy and rate environments, they responded by pulling back on forward-looking commitments. This was caused by the combination of unpredictable revenues, rising or volatile costs, and unclear rules or policies. As a result, many firms delayed or scaled down hiring, capital expenditures, and production or temporarily ceased operations (as with the New York keg manufacturer). This cautious stance itself contributed to slower activity in certain sectors and reinforced the broader sense of economic uncertainty across districts. [BeigeBook_20251015, multiple districts as cited above]\n\nIn sum, economic uncertainty across districts was not driven by a single factor but by an interlocking set of causes—tariffs and trade-policy shifts, inflation and cost spikes, weakening demand, policy and safety-net risks, sector-specific price swings (notably in energy), and rate-sensitive slowdowns in real estate. Each of these forces made future revenue, costs, or policy conditions harder to predict, and as a result, households, firms, and nonprofits responded with caution, cutbacks, and delayed decisions, further amplifying uncertainty in their respective districts.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements in the expected answer:\n1) Tariff policy changes made planning difficult for manufacturers (Chicago and across districts).\n2) Federal grant uncertainty affected nonprofits (Cleveland, New York, Boston).\n3) Policy uncertainty cited as a top business concern (Dallas).\n4) Immigration policy changes created labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston).\n5) Potential for government shutdown highlighted as a downside risk.\n6) Kansas City noted that despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic (so, uncertainty coexisting with longer-run optimism).\n\nComparison with system answer:\n- The system answer discusses tariffs and trade-policy uncertainty affecting manufacturers (Cleveland, New York, national) and planning, which is directionally consistent with tariff uncertainty but does not mention Chicago specifically and is much broader and more detailed than the narrow ground truth.\n- It does mention domestic policy uncertainty as a top concern in Dallas (matches point 3), though framed among several concerns.\n- It does NOT mention federal grant uncertainty for nonprofits in Cleveland, New York, or Boston; instead it talks about nonprofits/social services in Chicago facing uncertainty due to rising costs and reduced income/donations—this is a different mechanism than \"federal grant uncertainty\" in the expected answer.\n- It does NOT mention immigration policy changes or labor supply concerns in St. Louis or Boston.\n- It does NOT mention the potential for a government shutdown as a downside risk.\n- It does talk about Kansas City but only in the context of energy-sector uncertainty from falling natural gas prices; it does NOT mention that despite current decline, expectations for 2026 remained optimistic.\n- The system adds many other factors (inflation, housing weakness, safety‑net program risks, energy and agriculture price swings, interest rates, etc.) which are outside the expected answer and could be correct in some other context, but they are not required here. They are not explicitly contradictory to the ground truth, but they do not supply several of the specific items the question/ground truth focuses on.\n\nThere are no clear factual contradictions with the ground truth; the main issue is omission of several key factors and substitution of other factors. Some of the key facts (tariff/trade-related uncertainty; Dallas policy uncertainty) are present, but many required specifics (federal grant uncertainty, immigration policy changes, government shutdown risk, Kansas City 2026 optimism) are missing.\n\nGiven that: some key factors are correctly captured (tariff-related uncertainty and Dallas policy uncertainty), nothing obviously contradicts the expected answer, but the coverage is incomplete and somewhat off-focus.\n\nThus the best classification is PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

Tariffs and trade policy changes → higher input prices and material shortages\n- This was caused by new or higher tariffs on key imported inputs (such as steel, semiconductor chips, raw materials, and chemical inputs), and by broader trade-policy uncertainty.\n- As a result, manufacturers “faced elevated input prices and some difficulty procuring equipment and materials,” which directly constrained their ability to operate smoothly. [BeigeBook_20251015, NY]\n- As a result, supply availability “worsened,” even though reported delivery times were “little changed,” meaning firms could not always get what they needed, even if shipments weren’t dramatically slower. [NY]\n\n2. Higher steel prices → selective production halts\n- This was caused by tariff-driven increases in steel prices, which made this input significantly more expensive.\n- As a result, “an upstate manufacturer of kegs temporarily ceased production due to high steel prices,” a clear example where a specific supply chain cost shock led directly to a production halt in the New York District. [NY]\n\n3. Higher costs for components (e.g., chips, chemicals) → pressure on margins and planning\n- This was caused by tariffs on imported components like semiconductor chips and by higher prices for raw materials and chemical inputs linked to changing trade dynamics. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- As a result, manufacturers faced “headwinds related to tariffs, inflation, and uncertainty,” which increased production costs and made planning and pricing more difficult, even when output levels did not fall sharply. [Boston]\n- As a result, some firms sought new production configurations (for example, offshoring parts of production or shipping unfinished goods for final assembly in the U.S.) to “manage tariffs, shipping, and labor dynamics.” [St. Louis]\n\n4. Tariff and cost uncertainty → restrained production growth and shifts in activity by district\n- This was caused by ongoing uncertainty regarding future tariff levels, trade agreements, and input cost trajectories.\n- As a result, in the New York District “manufacturing activity was little changed after a summer uptick,” with “new orders…down, and shipments…mostly unchanged,” showing that rising costs and procurement difficulties held back further expansion. [NY]\n- As a result, “inventories continued to shrink” in New York, indicating firms were drawing down stocks rather than confidently rebuilding them, in part due to cost and supply concerns. [NY]\n- As a contrasting result, in Boston, manufacturing sales still “rose modestly since the last report, on average,” and in Philadelphia manufacturing activity increased “moderately,” showing that, despite supply and tariff headwinds, some regions managed to grow output—albeit under cost pressure. [Boston; National Summary > Philadelphia]\n- As another result, in the St. Louis District “manufacturing activity has declined slightly,” suggesting that in some regions the combination of cost pressures, logistics, and demand factors translated into mild declines in production. [St. Louis]\n\n5. Shifting international trade dynamics → weaker overseas demand and additional drag on production\n- This was caused by changes in international trade relations and tariffs that not only raised input costs but also affected foreign customers’ willingness or ability to buy U.S. goods. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- As a result, overseas demand for U.S.-manufactured goods declined in some cases, which compounded the cost and supply problems by reducing orders, further weighing on manufacturers’ production decisions.\n\nOverall causal chain:\n- Trade policy changes and tariffs → higher prices for steel, chips, and other inputs + difficulty procuring some materials → at least one documented temporary plant shutdown (keg manufacturer), higher production costs, and shrinking inventories.\n- These cost and availability issues, combined with weaker overseas demand, → manufacturing activity that was flat in some districts (New York), modestly growing but under pressure in others (Boston, Philadelphia), and slightly declining in others (St. Louis), showing that the disruptions constrained expansion and, in specific cases, forced production cuts or reconfiguration of supply chains, rather than causing a uniform, sharp nationwide collapse in manufacturing output.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements in the expected answer:\n1) Supply chain disruptions included: higher costs for utilities and imported semiconductor chips in San Francisco.\n2) In Chicago, modest decline in manufacturing demand; fabricated metals unchanged overall due to offsetting sectoral changes (higher in some sectors, lower in construction and autos).\n3) Tariff-induced input cost increases affected manufacturing broadly, with planning difficulties due to changing tariff policies.\n4) Labor shortages due to immigration policy changes constrained production in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture.\n\nNow compare with the system answer:\n- The system answer focuses extensively on tariffs and trade policy, higher input prices, procurement difficulties, higher steel prices, semiconductor and chemical input costs, uncertainty, and regional variation in output. This aligns partially with point (3): tariff-induced input cost increases and planning difficulties. That part is broadly consistent in spirit (tariffs → higher costs, uncertainty, constraints), though it is grounded in different districts (NY, Boston, St. Louis) than those in the ground truth. Still, it is not contradicting the ground truth.\n- However, the system answer does NOT mention:\n  • Higher utility costs in San Francisco.\n  • The specific Chicago pattern: modest demand decline; fabricated metals unchanged overall with sectoral mix (construction and auto weakness vs other sectors stronger).\n  • Labor shortages tied to immigration policy changes constraining production in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture.\n- Instead, it introduces other districts (NY, Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis) and additional mechanisms (a keg manufacturer halting due to steel prices, weaker overseas demand) that are not in the expected answer. While these details are not necessarily false, they are not supported or requested relative to the given ground truth.\n- There is no explicit statement of inability to answer, so ABSTAINED does not apply.\n- There is no direct contradiction of the ground truth; the answer adds different but thematically related information. The core asked question is “What supply chain disruptions affected manufacturing, and how did they impact production?” In that sense, the system gives an answer that is plausible and internally consistent, but it omits several key elements from the expected answer (utilities, specific Chicago demand shifts, and labor shortages from immigration policy) and shifts to other contexts.\n\nTherefore, the answer contains some correct, relevant aspects (tariff-induced input-cost increases and their impact on production and planning) but misses multiple key facts, so it is incomplete rather than fully correct or wrong.\n",

Technology includes cybersecurity, digital platforms, and regulatory/compliance systems; insurance includes liability and other coverage [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].  \n   - Effect on sector:  \n     - These higher service inputs raise operating costs and **tighten margins**, particularly where banks face competitive pressure on loan and deposit pricing.  \n     - Ability to pass on costs is more indirect (through fees, spreads, or service charges), and in competitive markets banks may absorb more of the increase, further pressuring profitability [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n4. **Professional and business services**  \n   - Cost drivers: Similar to banking in the Cleveland District—**higher technology and insurance costs** are specifically flagged [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].  \n   - Effect on sector:  \n     - Firms face rising back‑office and risk-management costs.  \n     - They **attempt to increase fees or billing rates** to cover these higher service inputs, but clients’ price sensitivity can limit full pass‑through, compressing margins when rates cannot be raised sufficiently [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n5. **Nonprofit and social services sector**  \n   - Cost drivers: Rising **insurance costs** are a major factor; broader operating costs (often including utilities and sometimes health‑related benefits) are also increasing [Chicago, New York; Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].  \n   - Effect on sector (contrast with for‑profit sectors):  \n     - Unlike manufacturers and retailers, nonprofits and social service providers generally **cannot raise prices** in the same way, because many services are grant‑funded, donation‑funded, or offered at low or no cost.  \n     - They are experiencing a squeeze from **higher operating costs alongside weaker revenues and donations**, leading organizations to:  \n       - Plan for **smaller budgets**, and  \n       - Reassess or **reduce the scope of services** they can continue to provide [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n6. **Cross‑sector comparison of impact mechanisms**\n\n- **Ability to pass through costs**  \n  - Manufacturing & retail: More likely to pass on higher insurance, health-care, technology, and utilities costs to customers, moderating margin damage but adding to output price inflation [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].  \n  - Banking & professional services: Partial pass‑through via fees or contracts; competitive pressures often prevent full recovery of higher service costs, so margins are more directly squeezed [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].  \n  - Nonprofits & social services: Least able to pass through costs; higher insurance and other operating costs translate directly into budget cuts and potential service reductions [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].\n\n- **Nature of cost pressure**  \n  - Goods‑producing (manufacturing): Service-related inputs like utilities and insurance are a growing share of total costs, adding to traditional material and labor pressures.  \n  - Service‑producing (banking, professional services): Service-related inputs (IT, insurance, health care) are often core overhead; increases immediately elevate the cost base and require price or productivity responses.  \n  - Mission‑driven (nonprofits/social services): Service-related input increases (especially insurance) are **budget‑constraining** rather than price‑setting, forcing programmatic trade‑offs.\n\nOverall, across sectors, the same categories—insurance, health care, technology/IT services, and utilities—are repeatedly identified as the main service-related contributors to rising input costs. The **key difference by sector** is how those higher costs are absorbed or passed on: profit-seeking sectors (manufacturing, retail, many business services) can at least partly offset them via higher prices or fees, while nonprofits and social service providers mainly absorb them through tighter budgets and reduced service capacity [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15].",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the expected answer:\n1) Service-related costs contributing to input cost increases: insurance, health care, and technology solutions.\n2) New York community service / social service providers faced rising business costs including insurance, adding to financial pressures.\n3) Employer-sponsored health insurance expenses saw outsized increases, intensifying labor cost pressures across districts.\n4) These service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer clearly identifies insurance, health-care costs, and technology/IT services as primary service-related contributors to input cost increases, matching point (1) and even adding utilities (extra but not contradictory).\n- It explicitly covers nonprofits and social services (including New York and Chicago) and notes rising insurance as a major component of higher operating/business costs, with constraints on their ability to raise prices, which captures the essence of point (2) about financial pressures on community service providers.\n- It discusses health-care costs nationally and in districts (e.g., Philadelphia) as important cost pressures, similar to the “outsized increases” in employer-sponsored health insurance that intensify labor cost pressures in the expected answer (point 3), even if it uses slightly different phrasing and provides more granular examples.\n- The only element not addressed is the mention that these service-cost increases occurred “alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.” The system answer is silent on tariffs or goods cost increases. However, the core of the user’s question is about service-related costs and sectoral effects; the system answer provides a much richer and accurate treatment of that, without introducing any factual contradictions.\n\nThus, all key service-related cost categories and sectoral impact mechanisms required by the question are present and correct. The omission of the contextual detail about tariff-driven goods cost increases makes the answer slightly incomplete relative to the full expected answer, but not in a way that misleads about the requested topic.\n\nGiven the rubric, this is best characterized as fully correct on the aspects actually asked (service-related costs and sector effects) with no wrong facts; the missing tariff context is minor and peripheral to the question itself.",

      "expected_answer": "In Chicago, leisure and hospitality sales were mixed. Categories seeing gains included restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments, as well as new light vehicle sales which were brisk due to strong underlying demand and the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases. Categories seeing softness included travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels. Used vehicle sales remained steady though dealerships in low-to-moderate income communities reported softer demand. This pattern reflects consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.",
      "system_answer": "Retail performance split sharply by category, and those splits map directly onto how consumers are adjusting to prices, incomes, and uncertainty.\n\nBelow, each set of gains/declines is linked to its main behavioral cause.\n\n---\n## 1. Autos: trading down within the category\n\n**What happened (gains vs. declines)**\n- **Declines / softness**\n  - Overall auto sales were flat to down in Cleveland. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Automotive goods sales declined moderately in Kansas City. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Philadelphia saw a slight decrease in auto sales that would have been larger without a temporary EV rush. [PHL–Trade & Services]\n- **Relative gains / pockets of strength**\n  - Used cars were a relative bright spot in Cleveland and expected to remain strong. [CLE–Consumer Spending]\n  - Demand in Kansas City shifted from SUVs and EVs to cheaper family sedans and used vehicles. [KC–Consumer Spending]\n  - New EV sales in some areas (e.g., Philadelphia) were supported by a rush before an EV tax credit expired. [PHL–Trade & Services]\n  - Chicago reported brisk new light‑vehicle sales, though used‑vehicle demand softened in low‑ to moderate‑income communities. [CHI–Consumer Spending]\n\n**Why (cause → effect)**\n- **Higher price sensitivity and budget constraints** caused consumers to **trade down within autos**, away from more expensive SUVs and EVs toward sedans and used cars. [KC–Consumer Spending; CLE–Consumer Spending]\n- The **impending expiration of a federal EV tax credit** caused a **temporary spike in EV purchases**, masking underlying weakness in some auto markets. [PHL–Trade & Services]\n- **Tighter budgets in low‑ to moderate‑income areas** caused **softer used‑vehicle demand at those specific dealerships**, even while overall new vehicle sales were brisk in Chicago. [CHI–Consumer Spending]\n\nAs a result, the “auto” category doesn’t show uniform strength or weakness; instead, consumers are reshaping what they buy (cheaper models, used) and when (before tax credits expire).\n\n---\n## 2. Food & Restaurants: still spending, but cutting extras and trading down\n\n**What happened (gains vs. declines)**\n- **Gains / resilience**\n  - Fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments in Chicago saw increased spending. [CHI–Consumer Spending]\n  - Richmond reported solid growth for luxury and quick‑service restaurants. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Pullbacks / selective weakness**\n  - Diners in Atlanta pulled back on desserts and alcoholic beverages. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Casual sit‑down restaurants in Richmond experienced softer sales. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - A Long Island food store reported muted grocery sales amid elevated costs for produce and meat. [NY–Consumer Spending]\n  - In San Francisco, demand declined for food products and beverages. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Why (cause → effect)**\n- **Rising food prices** and **higher overall cost of living** caused grocery shoppers (e.g., in New York) to **limit volumes and trade down**, yielding “muted” sales even as prices stay high. [NY–Consumer Spending]\n- **Heightened price sensitivity and “value awareness”** caused consumers to **favor cheaper restaurant formats (fast food/fast casual/family dining)** over more expensive, mid‑market casual sit‑down options. [CHI–Consumer Spending; CLE–Consumer Spending; Richmond]\n- **Budget pressure** caused diners to **keep the meal but cut the add‑ons**—such as desserts and alcoholic beverages in Atlanta—reducing average check sizes even when traffic holds up. [Atlanta]\n\nAs a result, food‑related spending shows that consumers are not abandoning eating out, but are actively managing checks (fewer extras) and formats (cheaper venues) to stay within tighter budgets.\n\n---\n## 3. Everyday goods & discretionary retail: split between value basics vs. status goods\n\n**What happened (gains vs. declines)**\n- **Declines / softness**\n  - In San Francisco, demand fell for food products, beverages, clothing, and pet supplies. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Sporting goods were weak in Kansas City. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Furniture sales softened in Richmond. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Several retail stores in Cleveland saw drops in unit sales, and a large retailer reported lower in‑store and online traffic. [CLE–Consumer Spending]\n- **Gains / strength**\n  - New York department store sales strengthened; apparel was selling well and cosmetics/fragrances remained strong. [NY–Consumer Spending]\n  - Luxury goods and athletic footwear performed well in San Francisco despite declines in other retail items. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Why (cause → effect)**\n- **Rising costs and economic uncertainty** caused many households to **hold back on broad, everyday discretionary items** such as sporting goods, furniture, and some apparel, leading to weaker sales in those categories. [KC–Consumer Spending; Richmond; National Summary]\n- **Lower‑ and middle‑income households becoming more selective and discount‑focused** caused **reduced unit volumes and more waiting for promotions** at general retailers, reflected in lower traffic and unit sales (e.g., Cleveland). [CLE–Consumer Spending; KC–Consumer Spending; National Summary]\n- At the same time, **higher‑income consumers’ spending was less constrained** and often status‑oriented, which caused **continued strength in luxury goods, athletic footwear, apparel, and cosmetics/fragrances** in markets like New York and San Francisco. [NY–Consumer Spending; SF; National Summary]\n\nAs a result, retail shows a “barbell” pattern: mainstream and mid‑priced discretionary items soften, while premium, status‑oriented items aimed at higher‑income consumers hold up.\n\n---\n## 4. Consumer electronics, appliances & building materials: prioritizing utility over nice‑to‑have items\n\n**What happened (gains vs. declines)**\n- **Gains / relative strength**\n  - Chicago reported strong increases in spending on **appliances and computers**. [CHI–Consumer Spending]\n- **Declines**\n  - In Chicago, spending on **other consumer electronics** (non‑essential gadgets) and **building materials** declined. [CHI–Consumer Spending]\n\n**Why (cause → effect)**\n- **Consumers prioritizing functional, work‑ and home‑related needs** (e.g., replacing or upgrading key household appliances or computers for work/school) caused **stronger demand in those categories** even under tighter budgets. [CHI–Consumer Spending]\n- **Post‑pandemic normalization in home improvement and less willingness to take on projects** caused **declines in building materials** and in nonessential electronics. [CHI–Consumer Spending]\n\nAs a result, spending within “durables” shifted toward items with clear utility and away from discretionary or project‑based purchases.\n\n---\n## 5. Travel, hospitality & leisure: mainstream travel soft, value dining and luxury travel diverge\n\n**What happened (gains vs. declines)**\n- **Declines / softness**\n  - Chicago noted softness in travel‑related categories including airlines and hotels. [CHI–Consumer Spending]\n  - Minneapolis reported weakness in retail/hospitality/tourism. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - Nationally, demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further. [National Summary]\n  - Youth entertainment and mid‑market travel slowed in St. Louis. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Gains / resilience**\n  - Fast food, fast casual, and family dining spending increased in Chicago. [CHI–Consumer Spending]\n  - Spending by higher‑income individuals on luxury travel and accommodations remained strong nationally. [National Summary]\n\n**Why (cause → effect)**\n- **Economic uncertainty and elevated costs of travel** caused households to **scale back mainstream and mid‑market travel** (airlines, hotels, youth entertainment, mid‑tier vacations), leading to softer demand in those categories. [CHI–Consumer Spending; St. Louis; National Summary]\n- **Weakness in international travel flows** caused further declines in leisure and hospitality demand in areas reliant on foreign visitors. [National Summary]\n- **Desire for affordable leisure experiences** caused consumers to **substitute toward lower‑cost local options**, such as fast food and family dining, which saw higher spending. [CHI–Consumer Spending]\n- **Higher‑income households’ stronger financial positions** caused them to **continue or even increase spending on luxury travel and high‑end accommodations**, even as mainstream travel softened. [National Summary]\n\nAs a result, travel and leisure show both down‑trading (toward cheaper local dining) and continued high‑end spending, with the mid‑market getting squeezed.\n\n---\n## 6. Cross‑cutting consumer behavior patterns revealed by gains vs. declines\n\nBringing the categories together, several consistent behavioral themes emerge:\n\n1. **Heightened price sensitivity and “value awareness”**\n   - This was caused by **rising prices and economic uncertainty**, which led consumers—especially lower‑ and middle‑income—to:\n     - Time purchases around **“sales, deals, and markdowns,”** producing small surges in activity during promotions. [KC–Consumer Spending]\n     - Become more **“value aware,”** scrutinizing prices and cutting extras (desserts, alcohol, add‑ons). [CLE–Consumer Spending; Atlanta]\n     - Prefer **cheaper formats** (fast food vs. casual dining, sedans/used cars vs. SUVs/EVs). [CHI–Consumer Spending; KC–Consumer Spending]\n\n2. **Trading down rather than cutting out**\n   - Household budget pressure caused consumers to **reconfigure how they spend, not stop spending entirely**:\n     - Within categories (SUVs → sedans; EVs → used cars; full‑service restaurants → quick‑service or fast casual). [KC–Consumer Spending; Richmond]\n     - On product mix (keep main meal, cut premium beverages/desserts). [Atlanta]\n   - As a result, value and entry‑price segments gained share even when category totals were flat or down.\n\n3. **Income segmentation of demand**\n   - **Lower‑ and middle‑income households** facing tighter budgets and needing to be “more selective” caused:\n     - Softer demand for big‑ticket items (autos, furniture, some electronics) in their neighborhoods. [CHI–Consumer Spending; KC–Consumer Spending]\n     - Stronger clustering of purchases around discounts and promotions. [KC–Consumer Spending; National Summary]\n   - **Higher‑income consumers**, less constrained, caused:\n     - Continued strength in **luxury goods, cosmetics/fragrances, athletic footwear**, and **luxury travel and accommodations**. [NY–Consumer Spending; SF; National Summary]\n\n4. **Prioritization of necessities and high‑utility spending**\n   - Concern about finances and the need to stretch budgets caused consumers to **prioritize essentials and high‑utility items**:\n     - Food and basic apparel (though volume is constrained by high prices). [NY–Consumer Spending]\n     - Appliances and computers that support work and home life. [CHI–Consumer Spending]\n   - As a result, more optional or project‑based categories—sporting goods, building materials, some travel—saw declines. [KC–Consumer Spending; CHI–Consumer Spending]\n\nIn summary, gains were concentrated in value‑oriented formats (used cars, fast food/family dining, appliances/computers), and in status goods for higher‑income consumers (luxury goods, cosmetics, luxury travel), while declines appeared in mid‑market and nonessential categories (sporting goods, furniture, some apparel, building materials, mainstream travel). This pattern was caused by broad price sensitivity, income‑driven selectivity, and a clear shift toward purchases that either maximize value or signal status, with everything in the middle under the most pressure.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Location/scope: Chicago leisure and hospitality.\n2) Gains: restaurants in fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments.\n3) Gains: brisk new light vehicle sales, driven by strong underlying demand and expiration of EV tax incentives.\n4) Softness/declines: travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels.\n5) Used vehicle sales overall remained steady, but with softer demand at dealerships in low‑ to moderate‑income communities.\n6) Interpretation: consumers are seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer is very long and multi‑regional, but it DOES explicitly mention several of the Chicago‑specific elements:\n  - It states: “Chicago reported brisk new light‑vehicle sales, though used‑vehicle demand softened in low‑ to moderate‑income communities.” That matches new‑vehicle strength and softer used‑vehicle demand in low‑ to moderate‑income areas. However, it does NOT mention that used vehicle sales overall remained steady; it emphasizes softness more than steadiness.\n  - It correctly reports: “Fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments in Chicago saw increased spending.” This matches the gains in those restaurant segments.\n  - It reports: “Chicago noted softness in travel‑related categories including airlines and hotels.” This matches the declines in travel‑related categories, and it describes them as soft.\n  - It connects autos to the end of an EV tax credit: “New EV sales in some areas (e.g., Philadelphia) were supported by a rush before an EV tax credit expired.” The ground truth specifically connects Chicago’s brisk new light vehicle sales to strong demand AND the end of tax incentives for EVs; the system answer mentions this mechanism but anchors the example in Philadelphia, not Chicago. Still, the mechanism (expiration of EV credit → rush in EV purchases) is consistent.\n- Interpretation of behavior:\n  - The expected answer: value‑seeking in dining, cutbacks in travel. \n  - The system answer strongly emphasizes value‑seeking behavior (trading down, price sensitivity, cheaper formats, etc.) and explicitly notes: “Desire for affordable leisure experiences caused consumers to substitute toward lower‑cost local options, such as fast food and family dining… even as mainstream travel softened.” That aligns well with the requested behavioral pattern.\n\nErrors/contradictions vs. expected answer:\n- There is no direct factual contradiction with the expected answer. The system goes well beyond the Chicago scope, but that’s additional context, not a conflict.\n- It slightly diverges on used vehicles: the expected answer says used vehicle sales remained steady overall, with softness specifically in low‑ to moderate‑income communities. The system answer highlights softness in those communities but does not clearly say overall used sales were steady. That’s an omission rather than a contradiction.\n- It associates the EV tax‑credit‑expiration rush example with Philadelphia, whereas the ground truth describes the end of tax incentives as a driver of brisk new vehicle sales in Chicago. This is still consistent in mechanism, but not matching the Chicago‑specific causal link; however, nothing here is explicitly false relative to the ground truth.\n\nCompleteness:\n- All core category directions (what gained/what declined) and the key behavioral interpretation (value‑oriented dining vs. cutbacks on travel; brisk new light vehicles; softness in airlines/hotels; softness in used vehicles in low‑income communities) are present.\n- The answer is more expansive than needed, but it includes all key facts and correct behavior mapping and doesn’t introduce contradictions regarding Chicago.\n\nGiven that all main expected points are covered and are accurate (with some extra detail and broader geography, but no clear contradictions), the answer is best classified as CORRECT rather than merely partial.",

      "expected_answer": "Energy sector performance varied significantly: In Atlanta (Sixth District), energy grew moderately - a positive outlier. In Dallas (Eleventh District), drilling and well completion activity was flat. Nationally, energy activity was generally down among reporting districts. The Chicago District noted higher energy prices as part of nonlabor cost increases affecting manufacturers.",
      "system_answer": "Below is a side‑by‑side comparison of energy sector performance and the specific activities mentioned, by District:\n\n---\n**Overall national backdrop**  \n- Nationally, energy activity was generally down, with the energy sector (along with agriculture and transportation) reported as weak to mixed across most Districts. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n---\n### Sixth District – Atlanta\n**Performance**  \n- In the Atlanta District, energy activity **expanded moderately**, making it a relative bright spot compared with both other sectors in the District and the generally down energy picture nationally. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Specific activities**  \n- **Crude oil production (Gulf of Mexico):** Production remained strong. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Liquefied natural gas (LNG):** Demand and U.S. exports were robust. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Electricity demand:** Solid, especially from commercial and industrial customers. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Carbon capture and storage (CCS):** Projects moved forward, indicating investment in low‑carbon infrastructure. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Solar development:** Projects slowed, even as the broader energy sector expanded. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Comparison note**  \n- While most Districts saw declining or flat energy activity, **Atlanta stood out with moderate growth**, driven by strong Gulf oil production, LNG exports, and solid power demand, despite a slowdown in solar development.\n\n---\n### Ninth District – Minneapolis\n**Performance**  \n- In the Minneapolis District, **energy activity decreased**, in line with the generally weak national energy environment. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Specific activities**  \n- **Oil and gas exploration:** Activity declined, and higher input costs raised the breakeven price for crude oil. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Comparison note**  \n- Compared with **Atlanta’s moderate expansion**, **Minneapolis experienced outright decline**, particularly in exploration, compounded by cost pressures that made new drilling less economical.\n\n---\n### Tenth District – Kansas City\n**Performance**  \n- In the Kansas City District, **oil and gas activity fell modestly**, with declining revenues, profits, and capital expenditures, even though oil prices remained slightly above profitable levels. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Specific activities**  \n- **Drilling and rigs:** Drilling was mostly steady overall but showed mixed patterns regionally:  \n  - Active rig counts **rose in Colorado and Wyoming**.  \n  - Active rig counts **declined slightly in Oklahoma**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Capital expenditures:** Reduced across the oil and gas sector, contributing to weaker overall performance. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Comparison note**  \n- Relative to **Atlanta**, which saw broader growth in oil, LNG, and power, **Kansas City** faced **modest declines** despite still-profitable prices, reflecting caution in capital spending and uneven drilling activity across states.\n- Compared with **Minneapolis**, where exploration fell due partly to rising costs, **Kansas City** still maintained some drilling stability but with weakening financials and investment.\n\n---\n### Eleventh District – Dallas\n**Performance**  \n- The Dallas District’s overall performance was **flat**, with no clear expansion, placing it between Atlanta’s growth and the declines in Minneapolis and Kansas City. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Specific activities**  \n- **Drilling and well completions:** Activity was flat; many rigs were stacked idle. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Oil production:** Overall drilling activity and oil production were flat. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Pipeline projects:** Continued to move forward, supported by more favorable regulatory and tax conditions. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Comparison note**  \n- Compared with **Atlanta**, which had expanding production and exports, **Dallas** saw **steady but stagnant conditions**—little change in drilling or production, although midstream (pipeline) investment continued.\n- Relative to **Kansas City**, which experienced modest declines in revenues and capex, **Dallas** maintained flat activity levels but with underutilized rigs.\n\n---\n### Cross‑District Comparison Summary\n\n- **Direction of performance:**  \n  - **Moderate growth:** Sixth District (Atlanta) – supported by strong Gulf oil, LNG exports, and power demand.  \n  - **Flat:** Eleventh District (Dallas) – drilling and production steady but subdued; investment shifted toward pipelines.  \n  - **Modest to clear declines:** Tenth District (Kansas City) – falling revenues and capex; mixed rig trends.  \n  - **Declines:** Ninth District (Minneapolis) – reduced oil and gas exploration and higher breakeven costs.\n\n- **Nature of activities:**  \n  - **Upstream focus with weakness:** Minneapolis (exploration down), Kansas City (modest fall in drilling-related financial metrics), Dallas (flat drilling with idle rigs).  \n  - **More diversified and relatively strong:** Atlanta (upstream Gulf production, LNG exports, electricity demand, CCS projects) even while solar slowed.\n\nIn sum, against a national backdrop of generally down energy activity, **Atlanta’s District was the main outlier with moderate growth**, **Dallas hovered at flat levels**, and **Minneapolis and Kansas City experienced declines**, particularly in oil and gas exploration, drilling economics, and sector financial performance.

      "question": "How did banking conditions differ for consumer versus business lending across districts?",
      "expected_answer": "In Kansas City, while expectations for 2026 were optimistic, consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately, signaling stress among households. In Chicago, business loan demand decreased slightly on net with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity, while consumer loan demand increased slightly with a pickup in mortgage refinancing. In Dallas, loan demand grew overall. St. Louis reported banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions. Consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.",
      "system_answer": "Below is a district‑by‑district, side‑by‑side comparison of consumer versus business lending conditions, using only what is supported in the cited Beige Book excerpts.\n\n---\n### Philadelphia (Third District)\n- **Consumer lending:** Consumer credit was generally **stronger**:\n  - Consumer lending excluding autos and credit cards **rose strongly**. Home equity lines **increased moderately**. Auto loans **rose modestly**, and mortgages **ticked up slightly**. Credit card volumes **decreased modestly**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Business lending:** Business credit was **weaker**:\n  - Lending declined, driven by a **continued strong decline in commercial and industrial (C&I) lending** and a **modest decline in commercial real estate (CRE) loans**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Comparison:** In Philadelphia, **business lending weakened, while most forms of consumer lending expanded**, indicating **stronger conditions on the consumer side than on the business side**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n---\n### Chicago (Seventh District)\n- **Consumer lending:**\n  - **Consumer loan demand increased slightly**, including a modest pickup in mortgage refinancing. Consumer loan quality was **flat**. Interest rates **edged down**, but **lending terms tightened slightly** for consumer loans. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Business lending:**\n  - **Business loan demand decreased slightly.** The new evidence does **not** document any change in business lending terms or loan rates, nor any specific sectoral weakness. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Comparison:** In Chicago, **consumer loan demand firmed slightly while business loan demand softened slightly**; consumer terms tightened a bit, but we do not have explicit evidence that business credit quality or pricing changed. Overall, **demand conditions looked somewhat stronger for consumers than for businesses**, based on the available text. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n---\n### Atlanta (Sixth District)\n- **Consumer lending:**\n  - Overall **consumer lending contracted further**, though there was a small uptick in HELOC applications. Banks reported **generally healthy credit quality**, but **delinquencies ticked up**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Business lending:**\n  - Earlier evidence (not re‑quoted in the new chunks) described **muted demand for corporate loans**; the new excerpts do not add segment detail or contradict that characterization. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Comparison:** With the provided text, we can say **consumer volumes were explicitly reported as contracting**, while corporate demand was described more generically as **muted**. However, **we do not have precise quantitative or quality data for business loans**, so any fine‑grained ranking beyond “both sides were soft, with an explicit contraction noted for consumers” would be speculative. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n---\n### Kansas City (Tenth District)\n- **Consumer lending:**\n  - **Loan demand and credit standards:** Banks reported **“little to no change in loan demand and credit standards across categories,”** which includes consumer credit. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Kansas City]\n  - **Portfolio performance:** Despite overall loan quality being “sound,” there was **“moderate deterioration in consumer lending portfolios.”** Most banks **expect consumer portfolios to face further challenges**, especially for **lower‑income borrowers and workers in discretionary‑spending industries**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Kansas City]\n- **Business lending:**\n  - **Loan demand and standards:** Also described as **having “little to no change” across categories**, implying **broad stability in business loan demand and standards**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Kansas City]\n  - **Quality:** No specific deterioration in business loan portfolios is mentioned; only the consumer segment is singled out for moderate deterioration. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Kansas City]\n- **Comparison:** In Kansas City, **demand and standards were stable for both consumer and business lending**, but **credit performance weakened specifically in consumer portfolios**, while overall loan quality remained sound. This implies that **consumer lending conditions were weaker than business lending from a credit‑quality standpoint**, even though demand was flat for both. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Kansas City]\n\n---\n### St. Louis (Eighth District)\n- **Consumer lending:**\n  - The report states **overall banking activity and credit conditions remained unchanged and strong**, but **does not provide consumer‑specific detail**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Business lending:**\n  - Similarly, it notes **loan demand/credit standards were unchanged**, with **strong overall credit conditions**, but **no separate discussion of business lending**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Comparison:** For St. Louis, **we cannot distinguish consumer from business lending conditions** based on the excerpts; both are implicitly covered under “unchanged” and “strong” overall credit conditions. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n---\n### New York (Second District)\n- **Consumer lending:**\n  - The excerpt we have only indicates **“overall loan demand declined,”** without a consumer/business breakdown. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Business lending:**\n  - Same: only aggregate **loan demand declined**, with no segment detail. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Comparison:** With the provided text, **no consumer‑versus‑business distinction can be made** for New York. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n---\n### Dallas (Eleventh District)\n- **Consumer lending:**\n  - The summary notes that **loan volume and demand rose modestly**, but does not specify consumer versus business components. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Business lending:**\n  - Same aggregate phrase: **loan volume and demand rose modestly**; no explicit breakdown. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Comparison:** For Dallas, we only know **total lending strengthened modestly**; **we cannot say whether consumer or business lending was relatively stronger**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n---\n### Cross‑district comparison of consumer vs. business lending\nPutting these districts side‑by‑side:\n\n- **Districts where consumer lending looked stronger than business lending (mainly on demand):**\n  - **Philadelphia:** Consumer lending (most categories) **rose**, while C&I and CRE **declined**, leaving consumer conditions **clearly stronger than business conditions**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Chicago:** Consumer loan demand **increased slightly** and business loan demand **decreased slightly**; consumer terms tightened a bit but demand was firmer on the consumer side. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Districts where consumer lending looked weaker than business lending (mainly on performance):**\n  - **Kansas City:** Demand and standards were **broadly flat** for both segments, but **moderate deterioration was noted only in consumer portfolios**, with further consumer‑side challenges expected. That makes **consumer credit performance weaker relative to business**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Kansas City]\n  - **Atlanta:** The report explicitly notes **further contraction in consumer lending** and a small rise in delinquencies, while corporate credit was described only as **muted** demand; that points to **particular softness on the consumer side**, although the business side was not strong either. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Districts with no clear segment split in the excerpts:**\n  - **St. Louis:** Overall conditions **unchanged and strong**, but **no consumer vs. business detail**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **New York, Dallas:** Only **aggregate loan‑demand changes** (NY: down; Dallas: up modestly) are given, with **no segment breakdown**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Overall:** The Beige Book excerpts do **not** support a single nationwide pattern such as “business lending was generally weaker than consumer lending.” Instead, the relationship **varied by district**:\n- Some districts (notably **Philadelphia, Chicago**) showed **firmer consumer demand than business demand**.\n- At least one district (**Kansas City**) showed **specifically weaker performance in consumer portfolios than in business portfolios**, even with similar demand.\n- Others (**Atlanta, St. Louis, New York, Dallas**) either showed **consumer‑side softening without a detailed business comparison**, or provided only aggregate banking conditions that do not allow a segment‑level comparison.\n\nThese differences underscore that **consumer versus business lending conditions were district‑specific**, rather than following a single, uniform national pattern.

      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "The question and ground truth focus narrowly on how banking conditions differed for consumer vs. business lending in specific districts: Kansas City, Chicago, Dallas, and St. Louis, with an emphasis on consumer stress vs. business lending being mixed or different. Key ground-truth points:\n- Kansas City: expectations for 2026 optimistic; consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately, signaling household stress.\n- Chicago: business loan demand decreased slightly; consumer loan demand increased slightly, with pickup in mortgage refinancing.\n- Dallas: loan demand grew overall.\n- St. Louis: banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions; consumer lending showed some signs of stress; business lending mixed.\n\nNow compare to the system answer:\n- It correctly captures Chicago: notes business loan demand decreased slightly, consumer loan demand increased slightly, with a pickup in mortgage refinancing.\n- It correctly captures Kansas City: notes moderate deterioration in consumer lending portfolios, with demand and standards little changed, implying weaker consumer performance vs. business.\n- It captures Dallas as overall loan volume and demand rose modestly (in line with “loan demand grew overall,” though it does not distinguish consumer vs. business there, but the ground truth also only states overall growth).\n- For St. Louis, the system says banking activity and credit conditions remained unchanged and strong and that there is no consumer/business breakdown; the ground truth adds the nuance that consumer lending showed some signs of stress and business lending was mixed. So the system misses (and slightly contradicts by omission) the consumer stress and business-mixed nuance, but it doesn’t state something factually opposite; it just claims the excerpts don’t provide detail.\n- The system answer also brings in multiple other districts (Philadelphia, Atlanta, New York) that are not in the ground truth. That extra information is not required but not necessarily wrong given Beige Book context.\n\nNo explicit factual errors relative to the described district excerpts are apparent; the main issue is incompleteness versus the expected answer, especially for St. Louis where the ground truth has more detail (consumer stress, mixed business conditions) and the system says it cannot distinguish segments. However, the question asks broadly how conditions differed across districts, and the system gives a detailed comparative discussion that includes and correctly characterizes the key differences for Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas, while giving a more limited but not false summary for St. Louis.\n\nThus, the system answer contains many key facts (especially Chicago and Kansas City and Dallas overall loan growth), but it omits/underplays the specific consumer stress and mixed business conditions in St. Louis described in the ground truth. That makes it incomplete but not clearly factually wrong.\n\nTherefore the best verdict is PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

      "question": "How did price pressures differ between manufacturing and services sectors?",
      "expected_answer": "In Dallas, price pressures were subdued in services but remained elevated in the manufacturing sector. In Richmond, price growth remained moderate overall despite some pickup in price growth in the manufacturing sector. In Chicago, producer prices grew moderately with contacts reporting moderate nonlabor cost increases including energy and raw materials. Manufacturing contacts attributed some raw materials price increases to tariffs, suggesting tariffs disproportionately affected goods-producing sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Across the Beige Book Districts, price pressures differed notably between manufacturing and services, with manufacturing generally seeing stronger and more immediate pressures than services.\n\n**Overall intensity of price pressures**  \n- **Manufacturing:** Price pressures were described as *elevated* and often *stronger* than in services, driven by significant increases in input costs. In several Districts, manufacturers reported that input prices were rising more rapidly than those faced by service firms, and they expected selling price growth to remain strong or accelerate. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Services:** In contrast, service-sector price pressures were typically *subdued to moderate*. Dallas reported subdued current price pressures in services, while Kansas City characterized service input price increases as moderate. Richmond saw virtually no change in service-sector price growth. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Sources and nature of input cost pressures**  \n- **Manufacturing:** Manufacturers cited specific cost drivers such as tariffs, electricity, utilities, and health-care premiums as major contributors to higher input costs. Tariffs were especially prominent, with firms anticipating additional cost pass-through once pre-tariff inventories are depleted. These factors created notable upward pressure on manufacturing prices across multiple Districts. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Services:** Service firms also faced rising input costs, but the pace was generally moderate rather than acute. For example, in Kansas City, service input prices were rising at a moderate rate, without the same emphasis on tariff-related surges seen in manufacturing. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Current pricing behavior (selling prices)**  \n- **Manufacturing:** Many manufacturers have already raised selling prices or added surcharges to offset higher costs. In some regions, they reported stronger increases in prices received and were able to pass along at least part of the input cost increases. However, pricing power was uneven: some manufacturers held prices steady or limited increases because of softer demand and greater customer price sensitivity. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Services:** Service-sector firms generally reported smaller or more gradual price increases. In Dallas, current service price pressures were subdued, and in Richmond, there was little change in service price growth. Still, some service firms noted they could raise prices without significant pushback, implying selective pricing power, but overall changes were less pronounced than in manufacturing. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Expectations for future price changes**  \n- **Manufacturing:** Looking ahead, manufacturing firms anticipate continued strong price pressures. In some Districts (e.g., Kansas City and Dallas), manufacturers expect selling price growth to either remain elevated or accelerate, especially as tariff-related costs work fully through supply chains. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Services:** Service firms expect price increases to pick up somewhat but remain moderate relative to manufacturing. In Dallas, services firms anticipate that selling price increases will accelerate over the next 12 months from currently subdued levels. In Kansas City, services firms expect moderate ongoing increases, with slightly faster hikes projected into 2026. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Bottom line comparison**  \n- **Manufacturing:** Experiencing more immediate, broad-based, and tariff-sensitive cost pressures, with many firms already raising prices and expecting strong selling price growth to persist. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Services:** Facing milder, more gradual price pressures, with current conditions often described as subdued or moderate and expectations centered on moderate future increases rather than strong or pronounced price escalation. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n- Dallas: price pressures subdued in services but remained elevated in manufacturing.\n- Richmond: overall price growth moderate; some pickup in price growth in manufacturing.\n- Chicago: producer prices grew moderately; moderate nonlabor cost increases including energy and raw materials.\n- Manufacturing contacts linked some raw materials price increases to tariffs, indicating tariffs disproportionately affected goods-producing sectors.\n\nComparison with system answer:\n- The system captures the broad contrast that manufacturing generally saw stronger price pressures than services, which is consistent with Dallas (elevated manufacturing vs subdued services).\n- It explicitly states Dallas services price pressures were subdued and manufacturing price pressures elevated/stronger, matching the Dallas detail.\n- It does not mention Richmond’s characterization of overall moderate price growth with a pickup in manufacturing specifically; instead it vaguely says Richmond saw virtually no change in service-sector price growth. It thus misses the nuance about manufacturing price growth in Richmond.\n- It does not mention Chicago at all: no reference to producer prices growing moderately, nor to moderate nonlabor cost increases (energy, raw materials). This whole part of the expected answer is absent.\n- It does correctly mention tariffs as a prominent cost driver in manufacturing and indicates they disproportionately affect manufacturing via input costs; this aligns with the ground truth’s point about tariffs affecting goods-producing sectors.\n- There are no direct contradictions with the expected answer; the system answer is broader and adds other districts (Kansas City) but not in a way that conflicts with the described facts.\n\nThus, the system answer contains some but not all key facts (Dallas contrast and tariff impact) and omits the specific Richmond manufacturing pickup and all Chicago details. It is incomplete but not wrong or misleading relative to the ground truth.\n",

      "question": "How did hiring patterns change, and what does this indicate about employer confidence?",
      "expected_answer": "Employers showed cautious hiring behavior: More employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. Those still hiring favored temporary and part-time workers over full-time employment. In Boston, both hiring and layoffs increased modestly, indicating churn rather than net growth. Employment in IT services increased modestly with hiring in sales and technical positions - a relative bright spot. Jobseekers in Cleveland reported offers were more likely to be part-time with little or no benefits. This pattern indicates employer uncertainty and reluctance to commit to permanent workforce expansion.",
      "system_answer": "Hiring patterns changed from growth-oriented to cautionary, and this shift reveals weaker employer confidence.\n\n1. Shift in hiring patterns\n- Previously, many firms were hiring to **expand** their workforces. \n- This changed to a more **cautious, replacement-focused** approach: employers are now mainly hiring to **backfill vacancies** instead of adding new positions. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Employers have also **increased use of temporary, temp-to-hire, and part-time roles** instead of committing to permanent full-time staff. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **Layoffs and reductions via attrition** (not replacing people who leave) have become more common, and some firms describe a “hiring chill” with delays in planned expansion. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- Demand for **staffing firms has softened**, indicating businesses are pulling back even on outsourced hiring. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. What caused these changes in hiring patterns?\n- This was caused by **elevated economic uncertainty**, which makes firms less confident that current demand will continue. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- This was also caused by **early adoption of AI and other technologies**, which allows firms to meet output needs with fewer permanent workers and encourages them to experiment rather than immediately build large, long-term teams. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- As a result of these factors, firms increasingly:\n  - Hold **headcount flat** instead of growing staffing levels\n  - Use **flexible staffing arrangements** (temp, contract, part-time)\n  - Allow **attrition** to reduce staff rather than conducting large expansions\n\n3. What this indicates about employer confidence\n- Hiring behavior is a **real-time indicator of confidence**: when firms are confident in future demand and growth, they are more willing to **add permanent full-time employees** and increase headcount. When they are uncertain, they pull back. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- In the current environment, the movement toward **replacement-only hiring**, more **selective filling of openings**, and reliance on **temporary and temp-to-hire roles** indicates that employers **do not trust that current demand is durable**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- This was caused by a desire to **avoid long-term labor cost commitments** in case conditions worsen. As a result, firms prioritize **flexibility and risk management** over aggressive growth, even where labor demand is still described as “healthy.” [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n- The softening demand for staffing firms and reports of a “hiring chill” are further effects of this same underlying cause: **subdued business sentiment and caution about future economic conditions**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nCause-effect summary\n- **Economic uncertainty + early AI adoption → Cautious hiring patterns** (flat headcount, mainly backfilling, more temp/part-time, attrition and layoffs).\n- **Cautious hiring patterns → Evidence of subdued employer confidence**, as firms seek flexibility rather than commit to long-term workforce expansion.\n- **Subdued confidence → Delayed expansion plans and softer staffing-firm demand**, reinforcing the pattern of guarded, risk-averse hiring.\n\nTogether, these changes show that while labor demand hasn’t collapsed, employers’ confidence in sustained growth is muted, leading them to favor flexibility and cost control over aggressive hiring for expansion. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements of the expected answer:\n- Employers became more cautious; more reported lowering headcounts via layoffs and attrition.\n- Those still hiring favored temporary/part-time over full-time.\n- Boston: both hiring and layoffs increased modestly, implying churn not net growth.\n- IT services employment increased modestly (sales/technical hiring) as a bright spot.\n- Cleveland jobseekers saw more part-time offers with little/no benefits.\n- Overall this indicates uncertainty and reluctance to commit to permanent expansion.\n\nSystem answer comparison:\n- It accurately describes a shift from growth-oriented to cautious hiring, increased use of temp/part-time roles, more layoffs/attrition, and a desire to avoid long-term commitments, and correctly interprets this as weaker employer confidence. These align with the general pattern and conclusion in the ground truth.\n- However, it introduces causes (economic uncertainty plus early AI adoption) that are not mentioned in the expected answer. While these might or might not be true in the original source, relative to the expected answer they are unsupported and speculative here.\n- It omits all of the specific regional/sector details that are key parts of the ground truth (Boston churn, IT services bright spot, Cleveland part-time with few benefits).\n- There are no direct factual contradictions with the ground truth’s content; the described patterns are qualitatively consistent (cautious, backfilling, temp/part-time, attrition, weaker confidence).\n\nBecause the system answer captures the main qualitative pattern (cautious hiring, temp/part-time vs full-time, use of attrition/layoffs, and that this signals subdued confidence) but misses the important specific examples and adds extra causal claims not in the expected answer, it is incomplete but not clearly factually wrong relative to the ground truth.\n\nThus the answer is partially correct, not fully correct and not incorrect/abstained.",

      "question": "What were all the key economic indicators for the Chicago (Seventh) District, and how did they compare to national trends?",
      "expected_answer": "Chicago District indicators: Economic activity was little changed (matching national 'little change on balance'). Consumer spending increased modestly (better than national 'inched down'). Manufacturing demand declined modestly (consistent with national challenging conditions). Employment was flat (matching national stable levels). Wages and benefits costs were up modestly (matching national modest-to-moderate). Prices rose moderately (matching national rising trend). Financial conditions loosened slightly (better than mixed national picture). Construction/real estate increased slightly (better than mixed national). Farm income prospects unchanged. Compared to national trends, Chicago showed relative strength in financial conditions, construction, and consumer spending while manufacturing weakness aligned with broader trends.",
      "system_answer": "Below is a side‑by‑side, indicator‑by‑indicator comparison between the Chicago (Seventh) District and the national picture as reflected in the October 15, 2025 Beige Book. All characterizations are qualitative (e.g., “modest,” “slight”) because the Beige Book does not provide numerical data.\n\n---\n### 1. Overall Economic Activity\n- **Chicago (Seventh District)**: Economic activity was **little changed**, and contacts **expected a slight decrease over the next year**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago summary]\n- **National**: Economic activity **“changed little on balance”**, with **3 Districts reporting slight to modest growth, 5 no change, and 4 slight softening**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n\n**Comparison**: Chicago’s “little changed” fits the national pattern of broadly flat activity. Its expectation of a slight decline places it closer to the group of Districts experiencing or anticipating **slight softening**, even though the national summary does not name specific Districts.\n\n---\n### 2. Consumer Spending\n- **Chicago**: **Consumer spending increased modestly.** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago summary]\n- **National**: **Overall consumer spending, particularly on retail goods, inched down**, though auto sales in some Districts were **boosted by strong EV demand** ahead of a federal tax credit’s expiration. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n\n**Comparison**: Chicago’s **modest increase** in consumer spending **outperformed the national trend**, where consumer spending was edging down, especially for retail goods.\n\n---\n### 3. Construction and Real Estate (Interest‑Rate‑Sensitive Sectors)\n- **Chicago**: **Construction and real estate activity increased slightly.** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago summary]\n- **National**: Conditions in **financial services and other interest rate–sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed**; some reports saw **improved business lending due to lower interest rates**, others noted **muted activity**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n\n**Comparison**: Chicago’s **slight increase** in construction and real estate puts it on the **stronger side of a nationally mixed picture**, where many places reported muted activity despite some improvement in lending tied to lower rates.\n\n---\n### 4. Employment\n- **Chicago**: **Employment was flat.** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago summary]\n- **National**: The national summary does not provide a single employment label, but District examples show variation:\n  - **Philadelphia**: Employment **increased slightly**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Philadelphia highlight]\n  - **Kansas City**: Employment **fell slightly overall**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Kansas City summary]\n\n**Comparison**: Chicago’s **flat employment** is **more stable than Districts with declines** (e.g., Kansas City) but **weaker than those reporting gains** (e.g., Philadelphia). In the aggregate national context, it fits the overall “little‑changed” theme.\n\n---\n### 5. Nonbusiness (Community / Nonprofit) Activity\n- **Chicago**: **Nonbusiness contacts saw no change in activity.** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago summary]\n- **National**: The national summary does not separately characterize nonbusiness/community activity.\n\n**Comparison**: Only Chicago’s narrative here is explicit. With no national benchmark, we can say Chicago’s nonbusiness activity was **stable**, but we cannot directly compare to a national descriptor.\n\n---\n### 6. Business Spending (Capital and Operating)\n- **Chicago**: **Business spending declined slightly.** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago summary]\n- **National**: The national summary groups business activity more broadly; specific mention of **improved business lending in some Districts** suggests mixed investment and financing conditions overall, but it does not directly label national business spending levels. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n\n**Comparison**: Chicago shows a **slight pullback in business spending**, which is on the **cautious/weaker side** of a nationally mixed picture where some firms are seeing better access to credit but many still report muted activity.\n\n---\n### 7. Manufacturing Activity\n- **Chicago**: **Manufacturing activity declined modestly.** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago summary]\n- **National**: **“Manufacturing activity varied by District,” and most reports noted challenging conditions due to **higher tariffs and waning overall demand**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n  - Example: **Boston** reported **modestly higher manufacturing sales** but cited **headwinds from tariffs, inflation, and uncertainty**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Boston manufacturing]\n\n**Comparison**: While the national picture is **mixed but broadly challenged** by tariffs and weak demand, Chicago sits on the **weaker side**, with a **modest decline** in manufacturing rather than growth. Its experience is consistent with the national theme of tariff‑ and demand‑related headwinds, but its performance lags Districts like Boston that still reported modest gains.\n\n---\n### 8. Prices (Inflation, Input Costs, and Tariffs)\n- **Chicago**:\n  - **“Prices rose moderately”** in late August and September, with a similar pace expected over the next 12 months.  \n  - **Nonlabor input costs** (energy; metals such as aluminum, copper, steel) **rose moderately**, and manufacturing contacts **attributed higher metals prices to tariffs**.  \n  - Some construction contacts reported **no change in input prices**, but overall **producer and consumer prices rose moderately**.  \n  - Some smaller retailers had **already raised prices because of tariffs**, even as larger retailers tried to delay pass‑through.  \n  [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago prices section]\n\n- **National**:\n  - National summary: **Prices continued to rise moderately** across many Districts (implied by individual District reports; e.g., Kansas City and Philadelphia).  \n  - **Kansas City**: Prices **“rose at a moderate pace,”** with expectations of **slightly faster price increases in 2026**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Kansas City summary]\n  - **Philadelphia**: **“Prices continued to rise moderately.”** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Philadelphia highlight]\n  - Tariffs are cited nationally as a key factor hurting manufacturing and raising costs. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n\n**Comparison**: Chicago’s **moderate price increases** closely match the **national pattern of moderate inflation**. Tariff‑driven input‑cost pressure in Chicago manufacturing is entirely consistent with national commentary that tariffs are a widespread headwind.\n\n---\n### 9. Wages\n- **Chicago**: **Wages were up modestly.** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago summary]\n- **National**: The national summary does not present a single wage growth descriptor, but:\n  - **Philadelphia**: Wages **“again rose at modest pre‑pandemic rates.”** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Philadelphia highlight]\n\n**Comparison**: Chicago’s **modest wage increases** are **very similar** to Philadelphia’s “modest pre‑pandemic” wage gains and broadly consistent with a national backdrop of **moderate price inflation and non‑surging wages**.\n\n---\n### 10. Financial Conditions and Credit\n- **Chicago**: **Financial conditions loosened slightly.** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago summary]\n- **National**: Conditions in **financial services and other interest rate–sensitive sectors were mixed**; **some Districts reported improved business lending due to lower interest rates**, while others **continued to highlight muted activity**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n\n**Comparison**: Chicago’s **slight loosening** in financial conditions lines up with the national observation that **lower interest rates have improved lending in some areas**, though nationally the sector is still described as mixed with pockets of muted activity.\n\n---\n### 11. Agriculture and Farm Income\n- **Chicago**: **Prospects for 2025 farm income were unchanged.** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago summary]\n- **National**: **Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts.** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n\n**Comparison**: Chicago’s **“unchanged” farm income prospects** are **more stable than the national characterization of agriculture as generally down**. Chicago appears somewhat less negative on agriculture than the national average.\n\n---\n### 12. Energy\n- **Chicago**: Energy contacts expected a **slight decrease in activity over the next year** (from earlier Chicago narrative). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, Chicago context]\n- **National**: **Energy activity was generally down** among reporting Districts. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n\n**Comparison**: Chicago’s expectation of a **slight decrease** mirrors the **national direction of weakness** in energy, placing it squarely in line with the broader downtrend.\n\n---\n### 13. Transportation\n- **Chicago**: The specific qualitative label for transportation in Chicago is not given in the cited chunks.\n- **National**: **Transportation activity was generally down** among reporting Districts. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary]\n\n**Comparison**: Without Chicago’s explicit wording, direct comparison is limited. Nationally, transportation is **under pressure**, and Chicago likely faces similar headwinds, but this cannot be confirmed from the provided text.\n\n---\n### 14. Summary of How Chicago Compares to National Trends\nPutting all indicators together:\n\n- **Broad Level of Activity**: Chicago is **broadly in line** with the national picture of **“little changed”** overall activity, but its forward‑looking sentiment leans slightly more negative.\n- **Demand‑Side Strength**: Chicago **outperforms** national trends in **consumer spending** and **construction/real estate**, both of which are **slightly stronger** locally than the national average of softening retail goods spending and mixed property markets.\n- **Production and Investment**: Chicago is **weaker than many Districts** in **manufacturing** (modest decline) and **business spending** (slight decline), matching national tariff/demand headwinds but landing on the **softer side** of that distribution.\n- **Labor Markets and Incomes**: Chicago’s **flat employment**, **modest wage gains**, and **unchanged farm income** indicate **stability but little momentum**, roughly consistent with national narratives of modest wage growth and generally weaker agriculture.\n- **Prices and Financial Conditions**: Chicago’s **moderate price increases** and **slightly looser financial conditions** are **highly consistent with national patterns**, where inflation is moderate and lower interest rates have begun to ease credit in some places.\n\nOverall, the Seventh District looks **middle‑of‑the‑pack or slightly weaker** in terms of current activity and manufacturing/business investment, **stronger** in consumer spending and real estate, and **very similar** to national patterns on prices, wages, and credit.\n",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements from the ground truth:\n- Overall activity: little changed, matching national “little change on balance.”\n- Consumer spending: increased modestly, stronger than national where it “inched down.”\n- Manufacturing: declined modestly, consistent with nationally challenging conditions.\n- Employment: flat, matching national stable levels.\n- Wages/benefits: up modestly, matching national modest-to-moderate.\n- Prices: rose moderately, similar to national rising trend.\n- Financial conditions: loosened slightly, stronger than mixed national picture.\n- Construction/real estate: increased slightly, stronger than mixed national.\n- Farm income prospects: unchanged, somewhat better than national generally down.\n- Overall comparative summary: Chicago relatively stronger in financial conditions, construction, and consumer spending; manufacturing weakness aligned with broader trends.\n\nThe system answer covers all of these points, often in more detail:\n- States Chicago activity was “little changed” and national “changed little on balance” and explicitly compares them.\n- Correctly notes Chicago’s consumer spending increased modestly versus national spending inching down and highlights outperformance.\n- Construction/real estate: Chicago increased slightly vs nationally mixed conditions; comparison explicitly made.\n- Employment: Chicago flat, compared to mixed national examples; aligns with “stable.”\n- Wages: Chicago wages up modestly; notes national modest wage gains (via Philadelphia) and treats them as consistent.\n- Prices: Chicago prices rose moderately; national prices continued to rise moderately; comparison made.\n- Financial conditions: Chicago conditions loosened slightly vs nationally mixed financial/interest‑sensitive sectors; says Chicago is on the stronger/improved‑lending side.\n- Agriculture/farm income: Chicago prospects unchanged vs national agriculture generally down; correctly notes Chicago is more stable/less negative.\n- The final summary explicitly states Chicago is stronger in consumer spending and construction/real estate, broadly in line on prices, wages, credit, and that manufacturing weakness matches national headwinds.\n\nNo key ground‑truth fact is contradicted. Additional sectors (nonbusiness, energy, transportation, business spending) are introduced, but these are nuanced and not in conflict with the expected answer. There are no clear factual errors relative to the ground truth; the extra granularity does not change the core relationships. Thus, the answer is complete and correct with respect to the expected answer.",
