      "question": "Why did Larry Page say they chose the name 'Alphabet'?",
      "expected": "Because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how they index with Google search. Also because it means alpha-bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark).",
      "predicted": "Larry Page said they chose the name \u201cAlphabet\u201d because of what the word represents and how it connects to Google\u2019s core mission.\n\n- First, the name \u201cAlphabet\u201d literally refers to a *collection of letters that represent language*. This was chosen because, as Page explained, language is *\u201cone of humanity\u2019s most important innovations.\u201d* This was caused by his view that the ability to encode and communicate information through language is foundational to human progress.\n\n- Because language is central to how information is organized and understood, Page saw a direct link between the idea of an alphabet and Google\u2019s core product. As a result, he said the name reflects *the core of how Google Search indexes information*\u2014Google\u2019s search engine works by processing words and letters to make information findable.\n\n- This reasoning was laid out in his August 10, 2015 Google Official Blog post, \u201cG is for Google,\u201d announcing Alphabet Inc. In that post, he explicitly tied the choice of \u201cAlphabet\u201d to both the importance of language and to the way Google Search operates.\n\nSo the name \u201cAlphabet\u201d was chosen because it symbolizes language (a fundamental human innovation), and this, in turn, mirrors how Google uses letters and words to index and organize the world\u2019s information through search. As a result, the name captures both a broad, human-centric idea (language) and Google\u2019s specific technical core (search indexing).",
