Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts.

Some reduced spending on nonessential items and curtailed vacation and leisure spending.\n\n- **Using credit and payment plans more heavily**: Many relied on credit cards and “buy now, pay later” services to maintain consumption levels, leading to elevated credit card delinquencies.\n\n- **Drawing down savings to cover basics**: Households increasingly used savings to pay for basic needs such as rent, utilities, and other bills.\n\n- **Turning to assistance**: Food pantry usage rose among both low- and middle-income households, and demand for community support (food, basic necessities, health care) increased.\n\n- **Trading down and delaying big purchases**: Lower-income consumers focused on sales-driven purchases; auto buyers shifted from more expensive vehicles toward family sedans and used cars, and consumers generally cut back on nonnecessities.",

It doesn’t contradict the cause (rising prices/uncertainty); it simply adds more detail (cutting nonessential spending, using credit, drawing down savings, turning to assistance, trading down, delaying big purchases).\n- These additions are not in conflict with the expected answer and elaborate typical responses; nothing contradicts the ground truth statement that they sought discounts and promotions.\n\nSo all key facts from the expected answer are present (seeking discounts/promotions as a response), with extra detail but no contradictions.

Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

Some firms said these cost pressures were mounting with “little room to cut costs further.”\n\n- **Difficulty passing costs to customers:** Many manufacturers initially absorbed tariff-related costs to avoid hurting demand, but reported that they could not continue doing so as pre-tariff inventories were depleted. Some expected to raise prices once these inventories were gone, while others already hiked prices multiple times.\n\n- **Uncertainty and planning problems:** Uncertainty about future tariff policy made it hard to set pricing, production, capital spending, and advertising plans. This uncertainty was cited as a factor in weaker or flat orders and in delaying or tightening investment decisions.\n\n- **Demand and competitiveness issues:** Higher prices from tariffs contributed to weaker demand for some manufactured goods and reduced overseas demand for U.S. goods. Some domestic manufacturers lost market share to better-capitalized rivals or foreign producers that were absorbing tariff costs to keep prices down.\n\n- **Misapplication and administrative disputes:** At least one manufacturer reported U.S. customs applying steel and aluminum tariffs to products that did not contain those metals, and challenges to these rulings were slow to resolve.\n\n- **Operational adjustments and complexity:** Firms had to search for cost-effective ways to manage tariffs, such as changing sourcing, shipping unfinished goods for final assembly in the U.S., reconfiguring products to cut costs, or tightening criteria for new investments.\n\nOverall, tariffs created higher costs, pricing and planning uncertainty, and demand and competitiveness pressures for manufacturers.",

In several Districts, firms delayed price hikes while working through pre‑tariff inventories or used tactics like surcharges, smaller portions, or product changes.  \n- A few reports noted foreign suppliers cutting their own prices to offset tariffs, which limited pass‑through in some cases.\n\nOverall, tariffs pushed input costs up broadly, but the degree of pass‑through to final prices differed across Districts and industries, so price effects were uneven rather than uniform.",

In Chicago, crops were in good shape across most of the District, though soybean prices were lower due to absence of new-crop exports to China. In Atlanta, overall demand for agricultural products was healthy. Minneapolis agricultural contacts were concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases.",
      "system_answer": "Conditions in the agriculture sector were generally weak and under strain:\n\n- **Crop producers:** Faced high input and financing costs, low or sub‑profitable commodity prices (especially for grains and oilseeds), and in some areas adverse weather that lowered yields or crop quality. Many reported deteriorating incomes and working capital, with some regions expecting significant farm bankruptcies or exits.\n- **Weather and disease:** Extreme or unfavorable weather (including drought risk from potential La Niña, heat waves, smoke, and dryness) and crop disease hurt yields and quality in several districts, though some areas reported strong harvests despite low prices.\n- **Trade and demand:** Trade policy volatility and reduced demand from China (especially for soybeans and some other exports) weighed on prices and export volumes, even where domestic demand remained healthy.\n- **Livestock and protein:** Conditions were notably better for livestock and protein producers in many areas. Demand for beef, poultry, and other proteins was strong, with high cattle prices and constrained supplies supporting incomes, though labor availability was a limiting factor.\n- **Costs and credit:** Rising costs for inputs (fertilizer, packaging, etc.) and higher interest/financing costs put financial strain on producers. Agricultural credit conditions deteriorated gradually in crop-heavy areas.\n- **Labor:** Some districts reported agricultural labor shortages, partly tied to immigration policy changes, which reduced harvests in affected areas.\n- **Outlook:** Overall outlook for agriculture was cautious to pessimistic, with many producers relying on government support programs as key safety nets.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the expected answer:\n1) Overall: \"Agriculture conditions were mixed across reporting Districts.\"\n2) St. Louis: conditions \"strained and have further deteriorated.\"\n3) Chicago: crops \"in good shape across most of the District,\" but soybean prices lower due to absence of new‑crop exports to China.\n4) Atlanta: \"overall demand for agricultural products was healthy.\"\n5) Minneapolis: \"concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases.\"\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer does say some areas reported strong harvests despite low prices, and that conditions were better for livestock/protein producers with strong demand, which loosely gestures toward “mixed” conditions, but it explicitly characterizes conditions as \"generally weak and under strain\" and an \"overall outlook ... cautious to pessimistic.\" That contradicts the ground truth characterization of mixed conditions with some clearly healthy demand (Atlanta) and good crop conditions (Chicago).\n- The system answer never mentions any specific districts (St. Louis, Chicago, Atlanta, Minneapolis) or their distinct conditions.\n- It does mention reduced demand from China, especially for soybeans, broadly consistent with concern about China’s soybean purchases, but this is generic and not tied to Minneapolis or to “elimination” of purchases.\n- It does not state that Chicago crops were in good shape or that Atlanta demand was healthy; instead it paints a broadly negative picture.\n\nBecause the system answer both omits the required district‑specific details and contradicts the overall \"mixed\" characterization by asserting generally weak/under‑strain conditions and a broadly pessimistic outlook, this is more than just incomplete; it is factually inconsistent with the expected answer on key points.\n\nTherefore the correct verdict is INCORRECT.",

Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong.

Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months.

The system compresses this into \"construction and real estate activity increased slightly.\" While it does not mention financial services explicitly and simplifies \"uptick in demand\" to \"increased slightly,\" this is directionally correct and not contradictory.\n- No factual contradictions are present; the system answer is just more general/terse and omits the detail about financial services.\n\nBecause all key directional facts (loosening conditions associated with modestly stronger construction/real estate activity) are correctly reflected, with only missing detail but no errors, the answer should be judged CORRECT rather than partially correct, since the question is high-level and the core content is present and accurate.",

This directly matches the expected point that higher-income individuals maintained strong spending on luxury travel and accommodation.\n\n2) Lower- and middle-income behavior:\n- System: Middle-income households \"sought value and deals, indicating greater price sensitivity\" and became cautious; low-income households were \"highly price sensitive\" with purchases triggered by \"sales, deals, and markdowns\" and cut discretionary spending. This matches the expected idea that lower/middle-income households sought discounts/promotions and were more price sensitive.\n\n3) Drivers of differences:\n- System: Explicitly attributes differences to income/financial cushion and rising prices: higher-income had more disposable income and savings; low-/middle-income were more affected by rising prices, housing costs, reduced benefits, leading to cutbacks, discounts, and debt use; also notes reduced real purchasing power and greater price sensitivity. This captures the core driver described in the expected answer: rising prices eroding purchasing power for lower/middle-income groups while higher-income groups were more insulated.\n\nThe system adds extra detail (credit use, tariffs, benefit cuts, etc.), but these do not contradict the expected answer and are consistent with it.

Districts with decline (New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco) had varied outlooks: New York businesses did not expect activity to increase much; Kansas City was broadly optimistic for 2026 despite recent declines; Minneapolis saw contraction across most sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Districts with growth:\n\n- **Fifth District (Richmond)**  \n  - Outlook: Modest ongoing expansion.  \n  - Details: Consumer spending at retail and restaurants grew modestly; port volumes increased slightly. Most other sectors were flat. Employment was unchanged overall, with some firms hiring and others cutting. Wage growth was moderate and price growth was moderate, with some pickup in manufacturing due to tariffs. Overall, the tone is cautiously positive, with growth but not broad-based strength.\n\n- **Sixth District (Atlanta)**  \n  - Outlook: Generally stable with sectoral divergence but no overall contraction.  \n  - Details: The overall economy was described as “unchanged,” but several key sectors expanded: manufacturing grew slightly, energy grew moderately, and agriculture was “healthy.” Wages grew modestly and prices increased moderately. Offsetting this, consumer spending fell, leisure travel softened, home sales declined, and transportation declined, while commercial real estate was flat. The stance is mixed but not negative: some core production and resource sectors are improving.\n\nDistrict with decline:\n\n- **Ninth District (Minneapolis)**  \n  - Outlook: Slight overall contraction with broad-based softness.  \n  - Details: Economic activity was “slightly down.” Employment was flat to slightly down, and price increases were only modest. Several major sectors declined: consumer spending, tourism, construction, residential real estate, and energy all decreased; agriculture weakened; manufacturing and commercial real estate were flat. Activity among minority- and women-owned business enterprises continued to decline. The picture is one of mild but widespread weakening rather than sector-specific strength.\n\n**Comparison of outlooks:**\n\n- **Breadth of Strength vs Weakness**:  \n  - Richmond and Atlanta show either modest growth or at least stability with pockets of strength (consumer spending and ports in Richmond; manufacturing, energy, and agriculture in Atlanta).  \n  - Minneapolis shows slight overall decline with many key demand and investment sectors weakening simultaneously.\n\n- **Labor Markets**:  \n  - Richmond: Employment unchanged, some firms expanding and others cutting.  \n  - Atlanta: Employment steady.  \n  - Minneapolis: Employment flat to slightly down, indicating a softer labor outlook than in the growing/steady districts.\n\n- **Prices and Wages**:  \n  - All three report moderate or modest price and wage growth, but in the declining Minneapolis District this occurs alongside falling activity, implying weaker demand conditions.\n\nOverall, the growth districts (Richmond and, in a more mixed sense, Atlanta) have a more favorable outlook characterized by either modest expansion or sectoral growth offset by declines, whereas the declining district (Minneapolis) faces a slightly negative outlook with more widespread softness across consumer, construction, real estate, energy, and agricultural sectors.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the expected answer:\n1) Growth districts are Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond.\n2) Their outlooks: Boston neutral to cautiously optimistic with mostly downside risks; Philadelphia modest growth with heightened uncertainty; Richmond modest/cautious expansion.\n3) Decline districts are New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco.\n4) Their outlooks: New York businesses did not expect activity to increase much; Kansas City broadly optimistic for 2026 despite recent declines; Minneapolis contraction across most sectors.\n5) Overall comparison: growth districts have mixed-to-cautiously-optimistic outlooks; decline districts have varied outlooks from pessimistic current views to longer-term optimism.\n\nNow compare with the system answer:\n- The system answer identifies Richmond (growth) and Atlanta (which is *not* in the expected growth list) as growth districts. It omits Boston and Philadelphia entirely and inserts Atlanta incorrectly.\n- For decline, it only discusses Minneapolis and omits New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco.\n- The specific described outlooks do not match the expected characterizations for Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Kansas City, or San Francisco, because those districts are not even mentioned.\n- The only overlap with the ground truth is that Minneapolis is correctly characterized as slightly down/contracting with broad-based softness, which is directionally consistent with \"contraction across most sectors.\"\n- However, the overall comparison (growth vs decline) is built on a different set of districts and therefore contradicts the ground truth set membership (e.g., treating Atlanta as a growth district when it was not listed, and failing to include several required districts).\n\nThus the answer is not just incomplete; it uses the wrong districts for the categories and presents a different comparison structure than requested. That goes beyond partial omission into being factually wrong relative to the specified ground truth groupings and district outlooks.",

This matches the ground truth.\n- The system answer does NOT mention the St. Louis District at all, so point (2) is missing, not contradicted.\n- For point (3), the system answer describes how in several districts (Chicago, Atlanta, Minneapolis, San Francisco) trade-related issues and uncertainty reduced exports, depressed prices, and hurt income and investment. That is consistent with the idea that agriculture was generally down and trade uncertainty added to challenges, even though it doesn’t use that exact wording.\n- There are no factual contradictions with the expected answer; the answer simply adds other districts (Chicago, Atlanta, San Francisco) that are not in the expected answer, which is acceptable and consistent with the RAG context.\n\nBecause the Minneapolis and “general trade-related challenges across districts” aspects are covered accurately, but the specific St. Louis deterioration/pessimistic outlook detail is missing, the answer is incomplete relative to the expected answer but not wrong or misleading.\n\nTherefore the correct verdict is PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

Profit opportunities for crop producers remained weak while conditions in livestock industries were considerably stronger, particularly for cattle producers. In a recent survey, over 80 percent of lenders in crop-heavy areas reported declines in farm income and working capital, compared to about 40 percent in areas with more cattle production. Agricultural credit conditions deteriorated gradually, and many lenders reported that weak conditions in the farm economy were having a modest negative effect on local economic conditions. Contacts remarked that strong cattle prices were supporting diversified operations but the weakness in crop profits were weighing heavily on farmer sentiment.",

Instead, it emphasizes Atlanta, New York, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis.\n- It adds an extra “community support organizations and small businesses” impact sector in San Francisco, which is additional detail but not contradictory.\n- There are no direct contradictions with the expected answer, but a key part of the question—Boston District’s role and the specific content about retail and tourism contacts and seasonal visas—is missing.\n\nBecause the central sectors and the St. Louis prominence are correctly captured, but the important Boston detail is omitted, the answer is accurate but incomplete relative to the expected answer, so it is partially correct rather than fully correct.",

This exactly matches the expected factor and its role.\n3) Other nonlabor / nonwage costs: The expected answer mentions energy and raw materials, specifically in the Chicago District. The system answer, under “Benefits and nonwage labor costs,” briefly mentions “technology and insurance for some service industries” as other cost items, but it does not mention energy or raw materials or the Chicago District detail. This is a missing detail rather than a contradiction.\n4) Interaction with wage growth: The system clearly explains that even with modest and in some places easing wage growth, total labor costs were rising because benefits, especially health insurance, were increasing faster than wages, which is the same conceptual point as “total compensation costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.” This aligns well with the expected interaction.\n5) Additional content: The system adds sector‑specific wage pressures and some firm responses (trying to hold wages flat, shedding workers). These are additional details but do not contradict the expected answer.\n\nSince all the core points about modest‑to‑moderate wages, outsized health insurance cost increases, and the implication that overall labor/compensation costs rose faster than wages are present and correctly stated, and there are no contradictions—only omission of the specific Chicago nonlabor cost examples—the answer is complete enough to be considered correct rather than merely partial.\n",

This matches point (3).\n- It correctly notes softness in other leisure and hospitality categories, specifically some travel-related businesses like airlines and hotels, matching point (2).\n- It implicitly conveys that leisure and hospitality as a whole were not uniformly strong by contrasting boosted restaurant revenue with softness in other categories, which is consistent with \"mixed\" conditions in point (1), even if the word \"mixed\" is not used explicitly.\n- However, it omits any mention of demand from restaurant groups being solid as indicated by commercial real estate leasing activity (point 4). That is a distinct, relevant fact in the ground truth that is not covered.\n- There are no contradictions with the expected answer; the content that is present is accurate and aligned.\n\nBecause at least one key fact (the CRE/leasing indicator of solid restaurant group demand) is missing, but the rest is accurate and non‑contradictory, the answer is incomplete but not wrong or misleading about what it does state.",

      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Lower rates positively affected some interest‑sensitive sectors.\n2) In Cleveland, commercial construction and financial services saw an uptick in demand due to lower rates.\n3) In Chicago, financial conditions loosened modestly with business loan volumes increasing.\n4) Some reports noted improved business lending due to lower rates.\n5) Residential real estate remained weak in Dallas and home sales were flat in Boston; overall, housing’s response was more muted than commercial sectors.\n\nCheck against the system answer:\n- Fact 1: The system clearly states that lower rates modestly boosted demand in some interest‑sensitive sectors but effects were uneven. This is consistent with the expected answer.\n- Fact 2: The system explicitly mentions Cleveland: “Commercial construction and financial services contacts reported an uptick in demand specifically because of lower rates” and repeats for commercial construction. This matches the ground truth.\n- Fact 4: The system cites a national summary that some districts noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower rates, which aligns with the expected answer’s “some reports noted improved business lending.”\n- Fact 5: The system states that “Dallas: Housing market activity remained weak,” matching the ground truth on Dallas housing weakness, and characterizes residential real estate as mixed with areas of weakness, which is consistent with the idea that the housing response was more muted than some commercial sectors.\n\nHowever, on Chicago (Fact 3), there is a contradiction: the expected answer says “In Chicago, financial conditions loosened modestly with business loan volumes increasing.” The system answer instead says “Chicago: Business loan demand actually decreased slightly on net despite lower rates,” which directly contradicts the expected direction of business loan volumes. The system also doesn’t mention Boston’s flat home sales, but omission alone would only justify PARTIALLY_CORRECT; the key issue is the contradictory Chicago description.\n\nBecause of this explicit contradiction on a central point, the answer must be judged incorrect under the given rubric, even though much of the rest is accurate and even more detailed than required.\n\nVerdict: incorrect",

Immigration policy changes created labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston). The potential for government shutdown was highlighted as a downside risk. Kansas City noted that despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic.",
      "system_answer": "Several specific factors in the districts contributed to elevated economic uncertainty:\n\n1. **Tariffs and Trade-Policy Uncertainty**\n   - Higher tariffs and “waning overall demand” weighed on manufacturing across many districts ([1], [3], [6], [12]).\n   - Firms reported increased cost pressures from tariffs and expected to raise prices in response ([1], [6], [8], [12]).\n   - Agricultural contacts cited lower soybean prices and lack of exports to China, plus concern over China’s elimination of soybean purchases ([9], [14]).\n\n2. **Domestic Policy Risks (Government Programs and Shutdown)**\n   - Planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid raised anxiety about the economic security of low‑ and moderate‑income households ([2]).\n   - Multiple districts warned of the downside risk from a *prolonged government shutdown* ([1], [6]).\n\n3. **Rising Prices and Cost Pressures**\n   - Households faced “rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty,” pushing lower‑ and middle‑income consumers to seek discounts and use savings to meet basic needs ([1], [2]).\n   - Businesses faced robust nonlabor cost growth and higher input costs (including fertilizer and health insurance), limiting flexibility and discouraging investment ([3], [8], [13], [14]).\n\n4. **Weak or Shifting Demand**\n   - Soft or declining demand in consumer spending, manufacturing, retail, agriculture, and some services led to flat or slightly contracting activity in several districts ([1], [3], [4], [7], [9], [11]).\n   - Changing consumer preferences and price sensitivity caused shifts in market shares and added to business uncertainty ([5], [12]).\n\n5. **Labor Market Concerns**\n   - Employers cited weaker demand and elevated economic uncertainty as reasons for layoffs and headcount reductions, contributing to uncertainty about employment and income prospects ([1], [13]).\n   - Labor supply constraints in sectors like hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing, partly due to immigration policy changes, added operational uncertainty ([13]).\n\n6. **Sector-Specific and Regional Risks**\n   - Agriculture: uncertainty about future income, higher input costs (especially fertilizer), and unclear outlook reduced capital investment plans ([14]).\n   - Energy: flat drilling and oil production in the Eleventh District added to concerns, with policy uncertainty and inflation cited as primary risks ([7]).\n   - Housing and workforce housing shortages, alongside rising construction costs, constrained development and added to uncertainty for households and builders ([2], [4], [8]).\n\nTogether, these factors—trade and tariff issues, policy and program risks, cost and price pressures, weak demand, labor-market shifts, and sector-specific challenges—contributed to elevated economic uncertainty across districts.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the expected answer:\n1) Tariff policy changes made planning difficult for manufacturers (Chicago and across districts).\n2) Federal grant uncertainty affected nonprofits (Cleveland, New York, Boston).\n3) Policy uncertainty was a top business concern (Dallas).\n4) Immigration policy changes created labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston).\n5) Potential for government shutdown was highlighted as a downside risk.\n6) Kansas City noted that despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic.\n\nCheck against system answer:\n1) Tariffs/trade-policy uncertainty: System clearly discusses higher tariffs, trade-policy uncertainty, and their impact on manufacturing and agriculture. This matches the first expected factor in substance, though it doesn’t name Chicago specifically. That’s acceptable.\n2) Federal grant uncertainty for nonprofits: Not mentioned at all. The system answer talks about SNAP/Medicaid cuts and household insecurity, but nothing about federal grant uncertainty affecting nonprofits in specific districts.\n3) Policy uncertainty as a top business concern (Dallas): The system does mention policy uncertainty in energy (Eleventh District) but not that “policy uncertainty was a top business concern” in Dallas or in that explicit framing. This specific point is missing.\n4) Immigration policy changes and labor supply (St. Louis, Boston): The system mentions labor supply constraints “partly due to immigration policy changes” but does not tie this to St. Louis or Boston. It captures the factor (immigration policy changes → labor supply concerns) in general form, so substantively this matches, even if districts aren’t named.\n5) Potential government shutdown as downside risk: The system explicitly notes “downside risk from a prolonged government shutdown.” This matches.\n6) Kansas City’s point about current decline but optimistic 2026 expectations: Not mentioned.\n\nContradictions: The system answer does not contradict any of the expected points; it largely expands with many additional, plausibly correct factors. The main issue is omission of some expected, district-specific sources of uncertainty (federal grants, Dallas policy concern, Kansas City’s 2026 optimism).\n\nGiven that several key expected elements (federal grant uncertainty, Dallas framing, Kansas City expectations) are missing but what is present is consistent and accurate, the answer is incomplete but not wrong or misleading.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate verdict is PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

This matches the first core point.\n2) It does not explicitly mention New York community service providers or that specific example; instead it gives examples from Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Boston, etc. This is an omission, not a contradiction.\n3) It captures rising employer health-care premiums as a major input cost, but does not explicitly frame them as “employer-sponsored health insurance expenses saw outsized increases across districts”; still, the described increases in multiple districts are consistent, not contradictory, just less explicitly generalized.\n4) It mentions tariffs and higher input costs in manufacturing, consistent with service cost increases occurring alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.\n5) The question asks also “how did this affect different sectors?” The expected answer is high-level and does not enumerate sectors in detail; the system answer goes further, detailing impacts across manufacturing, retail, restaurants/hospitality, professional/business services, banking, and general services. These additions are consistent with and expand beyond the expected answer, not contradicting it.\n\nThere are no factual contradictions with the expected answer; the system answer includes all the key categories of service-related costs and correctly places them in the broader context of tariff-driven goods cost increases and sectoral impacts. Missing the specific New York example is not required for correctness, given the question and rubric.\n\nTherefore the answer is fully consistent and more detailed than the ground truth without contradicting it.",

      "expected_answer": "In Chicago, leisure and hospitality sales were mixed. Categories seeing gains included restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments, as well as new light vehicle sales which were brisk due to strong underlying demand and the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases. Categories seeing softness included travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels. Used vehicle sales remained steady though dealerships in low-to-moderate income communities reported softer demand. This pattern reflects consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.",
      "system_answer": "Gains vs. declines by category, and what they suggest about behavior:\n\n**Retail goods with gains:**\n- **Appliances, computers, landscaping products** (Chicago [1]) – higher spending on practical/household and work-related items.\n- **Luxury goods and athletic footwear** (San Francisco [2]) – continued strong demand at the higher end.\n- **Apparel, cosmetics, fragrances** (New York [9]) – solid discretionary spending, especially among mid‑ to upper‑income consumers.\n- **Replacement windows, some home renovation-related items** (Richmond [3]) – consumers improving existing homes instead of moving.\n- **Health care and some food & beverage retail** (Dallas [5]) – essential categories holding up.\n- **Quick service / fast food and some luxury restaurants** (Richmond [3]; Chicago [1]; San Francisco [12]) – consumers still eating out, but often trading format.\n- **Entertainment venues and some business technology and health‑related food services** (San Francisco [12]) – selective spending on experiences and wellness.\n- **New light vehicles, especially EVs before tax credits expired** (Chicago [1]; Atlanta [6]; Boston [15]) – time‑sensitive, incentive‑driven buying.\n- **Used vehicles in some areas** (Cleveland [10]; Kansas City [8]) – shift toward cheaper options.\n\n**Retail goods and services with declines:**\n- **Other consumer electronics, building materials, furniture, and some electronics/appliance stores** (Chicago [1]; Dallas [5]) – pullback in more discretionary or big‑ticket durables, especially tied to housing.\n- **Many consumer goods: food products, beverages, clothing, pet supplies (mass‑market)** (San Francisco [2]) – softer demand, especially for more affordable lines.\n- **More affordable/lower‑priced goods overall** (San Francisco [2]) – weakness at the budget end despite strength in luxury.\n- **Auto sales in several districts, especially new, SUVs, and EVs post‑incentive** (Dallas [5]; Cleveland [10]; Kansas City [8]) – cost sensitivity and model mix shifting to sedans/used.\n- **Building material and garden equipment** (Dallas [5]) and **firms tied to new home construction, furniture** (Richmond [3]) – weaker housing‑related spending.\n- **Casual sit‑down and full‑service restaurants** (Richmond [3]; San Francisco [12]) – mid‑tier dining squeezed.\n- **Travel, hospitality, and tourism in many areas** (Chicago [1]; Minneapolis [7]; St. Louis [11]; San Francisco [12]; Cleveland [10]) – reduced leisure and business travel; especially mid‑market hotels and select‑service properties.\n- **Elective health procedures** (San Francisco [12]) – postponement of nonessential services.\n- **General retail trade on net** in several districts (San Francisco [2]; Dallas [5]; Atlanta [6]; Minneapolis [7]; Kansas City [8]; Cleveland [10]; St. Louis [11]) – broad but mild softening.\n\n**What this reflects about consumer behavior:**\n\n1. **Bifurcation by income:**\n   - Mid‑ to upper‑income consumers continue to spend on **luxury goods, luxury travel, higher‑end restaurants, cosmetics, apparel, technology**, and EVs before credits expire.\n   - Lower‑ and middle‑income consumers show **heightened price sensitivity**, greater search for **“value” and deals** (Richmond [3,14]; Minneapolis [7]; Kansas City [8]; Cleveland [10]), increased use of **credit, buy‑now‑pay‑later, and food pantries** (St. Louis [11]).\n\n2. **Trading down and prioritizing essentials:**\n   - Consumers still eat out but **shift to fast food/quick service** and cut extras like **desserts and alcoholic drinks** (Atlanta [6]).\n   - Strength in **health care, basic food & beverage retail**, and **used cars** versus weakness in more discretionary or premium mass‑market goods shows prioritizing needs over wants.\n\n3. **Cautious stance on big‑ticket and housing‑related items:**\n   - Softer sales of **furniture, building materials, some electronics**, and firms tied to **new home construction** signal hesitation around large, deferrable purchases.\n   - Some homeowners choose **renovation over moving** (Richmond [3]), favoring targeted, necessity‑driven upgrades (e.g., replacement windows).\n\n4. **Incentive‑ and deal‑driven behavior:**\n   - **EV and vehicle purchases spike ahead of tax credit expirations** (Chicago [1]; Atlanta [6]; Boston [15]).\n   - Reports of small surges tied to **sales and markdowns**, especially among lower‑income households (Kansas City [8]), show that promotions strongly influence timing.\n\n5. **Experience spending is selective:**\n   - **Entertainment venues and some tourism segments** (luxury accommodations, sports‑related and leisure travel in certain areas) perform relatively well, while **mid‑market hotels, casual dining, elective travel** weaken, again indicating polarization.\n\nOverall, gains concentrate in luxury and necessity categories, promotional or incentive‑driven purchases, and cheaper formats, while declines appear in mid‑tier discretionary goods, housing‑related durables, travel, and full‑service dining—consistent with a consumer who is still spending but more polarized by income level and more careful and price‑conscious overall.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "The ground truth is specifically about Chicago and a narrow set of categories: (1) gains in fast food/fast casual/family dining; (2) brisk new light vehicle sales driven by strong demand and end of EV tax incentives; (3) softness in travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels; (4) used vehicle sales steady overall but softer in low-to-moderate income areas; and (5) interpretation: consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.\n\nThe system answer instead provides a long, multi-district synthesis with many categories that are not in the ground truth. On the Chicago-relevant points:\n- It does mention \"Quick service / fast food\" gains and cites Chicago among others – this loosely matches the dining-gains idea, but it does not mention fast casual or family dining specifically.\n- It says \"New light vehicles, especially EVs before tax credits expired (Chicago...)\" which is broadly consistent with brisk new light vehicle sales tied to end of incentives, although it over-emphasizes EVs and does not state that new light vehicle sales overall were brisk.\n- It lists \"Travel, hospitality, and tourism... (Chicago...) – reduced leisure and business travel\" which is consistent with softness in airlines and hotels, though more general.\n- For used vehicles, it says \"Used vehicles in some areas ... – shift toward cheaper options\" but does not reflect the ground truth nuance that used vehicle sales were steady overall but softer in low-to-moderate income communities; instead it suggests a different pattern (shift toward cheaper options) that is not in the expected answer.\n\nThe behavioral interpretation in the expected answer is simple: consumers seek value in dining while cutting back on travel. The system answer gives a broad, multi-point behavioral analysis (bifurcation by income, trading down, etc.). Parts of that (trading down to fast food, cutting back on travel) are directionally consistent, but it adds a lot of structure (luxury strength, polarization, etc.) that goes well beyond what is supported by the ground truth and is not specifically about Chicago. \n\nKey issue: the question is about Chicago retail categories; the system answer generalizes across districts and brings in many categories (appliances, luxury goods, cosmetics, elective health procedures, etc.) that are not part of the expected answer. However, the evaluation criteria do not penalize additional correct detail per se, only contradictions. The main check is for contradictions with the expected answer. On the overlapping Chicago elements, there is no direct contradiction: fast food gains, new light vehicle sales tied to expiring credits, travel softness all align in direction. The used-vehicle description is different but not explicitly contradictory (a shift toward cheaper options could coexist with steady overall sales and localized softness). The broader income-bifurcation narrative is not contradicted by the narrow ground truth; it's just not required.\n\nBecause the system answer includes the core directional patterns (gains in quick service dining, gains in new light vehicles tied to incentives, declines in travel/hospitality) and a behavioral explanation that is compatible (value-seeking, trading down, cutting back on travel), and does not actually state anything opposite to the ground truth, it is incomplete with respect to some nuances (family dining, steady used vehicles with localized softness) but not factually wrong. That fits best with PARTIALLY_CORRECT under the rubric: some key facts present, no clear contradictions, but important expected details are missing or diluted in a broad, multi-district narrative.\n",

      "question": "How did banking conditions differ for consumer versus business lending across districts?",
      "expected_answer": "In Kansas City, while expectations for 2026 were optimistic, consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately, signaling stress among households. In Chicago, business loan demand decreased slightly on net with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity, while consumer loan demand increased slightly with a pickup in mortgage refinancing. In Dallas, loan demand grew overall. St. Louis reported banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions. Consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.",
      "system_answer": "Across districts, banking conditions for consumer lending generally showed rising stress and weaker performance, while business lending was more mixed—often with softer demand but still relatively solid credit quality:\n\n- **Kansas City:** Overall loan quality was sound, but banks reported *moderate deterioration in consumer lending portfolios* and expected further challenges for lower‑income and discretionary‑sector borrowers. No comparable deterioration was noted for business lending.\n\n- **St. Louis:** Commercial loan demand was described as strong in some cases (especially in Memphis), though small business demand was depressed but rebuilding. In contrast, *consumer delinquency rates were steadily increasing*, with more borrowers seeking credit counseling. Banks tightened standards broadly, with *more scrutiny on small business loans* but the clearest deterioration was on the consumer side.\n\n- **New York:** Demand for *business loans sagged*, driving an overall decline in loan demand. Consumer loan demand was steady, and residential mortgage demand grew moderately. *Delinquencies worsened slightly, especially for business loans*, implying comparatively more recent stress in business credit quality here than in consumer.\n\n- **Philadelphia:** Business lending weakened—there was a *continued strong decline in commercial and industrial loans* and a modest decline in commercial real estate loans. By contrast, *consumer lending rose strongly* (excluding autos and cards), with increases in home equity lines, auto loans, and mortgages, although credit card volumes fell modestly.\n\n- **Chicago:** *Business loan demand decreased slightly* and business loan quality declined modestly; rates fell but terms tightened. For consumers, *loan demand increased slightly*, loan quality was flat, and rates edged down with slightly tighter terms—consumer credit quality held up better than business here.\n\n- **Atlanta:** Loan demand from both businesses and consumers was muted, but *overall consumer lending contracted further* even as credit quality was still described as healthy; delinquencies ticked up. Business loan conditions were not highlighted as deteriorating to the same degree.\n\n- **Dallas:** Credit standards tightened for most loan types, but *standards and terms eased slightly for residential real estate (a consumer segment)* even as they tightened for other (largely business) loans. Commercial real estate loan performance *sharply improved*, while overall loan performance deteriorated slightly.\n\n- **San Francisco (banking details):** *Demand for commercial loans remained muted* except in certain project‑driven areas (e.g., Arizona semiconductors). Overall credit and asset quality remained stable; no particular differential deterioration was reported between consumer and business loans.\n\n- **Richmond:** Demand was stable for most loan types, with some *modest increase in commercial loan demand*. A few institutions reported *modest increases in delinquencies mainly within consumer loan portfolios* (including mortgages and HELOCs), suggesting more emerging stress on the consumer side.\n\n- **Cleveland:** Loan demand increased moderately for both households and businesses, encouraged by lower rates. Credit quality and delinquencies were flat overall, with no notable divergence between consumer and business segments reported.\n\nIn sum, many districts reported:\n- **Consumers:** Rising delinquencies or portfolio deterioration (Kansas City, St. Louis, Atlanta, Richmond), sometimes alongside steady or rising demand (Philadelphia, Chicago, Cleveland), with particular stress among lower‑income borrowers.\n- **Businesses:** Often softer or muted demand (New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, San Francisco), but generally sound credit quality, with a few districts noting modest deterioration or sector‑specific weakness (Chicago’s auto suppliers, New York’s business delinquencies), and some pockets of strong commercial demand (St. Louis, Richmond, certain San Francisco projects).",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements in the expected answer:\n1) Kansas City: expectations for 2026 optimistic; consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately; this signals household stress. No explicit statement on business loans other than contrast.\n2) Chicago: business loan demand decreased slightly on net with a cited decline in acquisition activity; consumer loan demand increased slightly with a pickup in mortgage refinancing.\n3) Dallas: loan demand grew overall.\n4) St. Louis: banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions. Consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.\n5) Overall contrast: consumer lending shows some stress; business lending more mixed.\n\nCheck system answer against these:\n- Kansas City: System says overall loan quality sound, but \"moderate deterioration in consumer lending portfolios\" and stress among lower‑income borrowers, and no comparable deterioration for business lending. This matches and even elaborates on the expected point (consumer deterioration, relative stability for business) and is consistent with the household stress idea.\n\n- Chicago: System says business loan demand decreased slightly and business loan quality declined modestly; consumer loan demand increased slightly, quality flat. This aligns with the expected answer’s directionality: business demand down slightly, consumer demand up slightly. It adds some detail (quality changes) but does not contradict.\n\n- Dallas: Expected answer: \"loan demand grew overall.\" System answer: focuses on standards and terms; says credit standards tightened for most loan types, with some easing for residential real estate; notes CRE performance sharply improved while overall loan performance deteriorated slightly. It does NOT mention that loan demand grew overall, nor does it contradict that demand grew. It’s just incomplete with respect to the key fact.\n\n- St. Louis: Expected: \"banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions. Consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.\" System: describes commercial loan demand strong in some cases, small business demand depressed but rebuilding; consumer delinquency rates increasing, more borrowers seeking counseling; banks tightened standards, more scrutiny on small business loans but clearest deterioration on consumer side. That is broadly consistent with “consumer lending showed some signs of stress” and “business lending conditions were mixed,” though it doesn’t restate that banking activity overall was \"unchanged\" or that credit conditions were \"strong.\" It doesn’t directly contradict those, instead it provides nuance by geography (e.g., Memphis) and stress on consumers.\n\n- Overall contrast: System’s concluding summary directly mirrors the expected pattern: consumer side showing more signs of stress/delinquencies in several districts; business lending often with softer demand but relatively solid credit quality, mixed conditions.\n\nThe system answer includes many additional districts (New York, Philadelphia, etc.), but those additions are not penalized under the rubric as long as they don’t contradict the expected facts, and they don’t. There is no explicit contradiction of any expected point; the main issue is that it omits to explicitly say that Dallas loan demand grew overall and that St. Louis banking activity was unchanged with strong overall credit conditions. That makes the answer somewhat incomplete with respect to those specific details but still directionally consistent and non‑misleading.\n\nGiven the rubric: missing some details from the enumeration but with no contradictions ⇒ PARTIALLY_CORRECT, not incorrect. The answer captures the key consumer vs business contrast and the Chicago and Kansas City specifics accurately, but misses the explicit Dallas overall loan demand growth and the \"unchanged/strong\" characterization for St. Louis.\n",

Profit opportunities for crop producers remained weak while conditions in livestock industries were considerably stronger, particularly for cattle producers. In a recent survey, over 80 percent of lenders in crop-heavy areas reported declines in farm income and working capital, compared to about 40 percent in areas with more cattle production. Agricultural credit conditions deteriorated gradually, and many lenders reported that weak conditions in the farm economy were having a modest negative effect on local economic conditions. Contacts remarked that strong cattle prices were supporting diversified operations but the weakness in crop profits were weighing heavily on farmer sentiment.",

Surveys found softening labor demand among District employers, as well as declining head count, though seasonality played a role. A staffing firm with multiple offices saw hiring decline at the end of summer after an earlier uptick. A staffing contact in Michigan's Upper Peninsula noted healthy labor demand in manufacturing, construction, and mining, but acknowledged that \"the uncertainty in the market has spurred more temp and temp-to-hire work in our area,\" rather than direct hiring. Hospitality and tourism firms reported that they were predominantly hiring to replace turnover; only one in ten were hiring new full-time employees, and a comparable share was cutting workers. However, recent unemployment claims across the District remained low overall. Montana employers reported healthy labor demand, but a contact said that \"most hiring is to replace vacancies rather than support business expansion.\" Artificial intelligence was expected to have a slight dampening effect on future labor demand. A Minnesota advertising firm said there \"will be a smaller need for entry-level folks\" because Al tools \"get this work done faster.\"",

Employers that reported hiring generally noted improved labor availability, and some favored hiring temporary and part-time workers over offering full-time employment opportunities. Nevertheless, labor supply in the hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing sectors was reportedly strained in several Districts due to recent changes to immigration policies. Wages grew across all reporting Districts, generally at a modest to moderate pace, and labor cost pressures intensified in recent weeks due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses.",
