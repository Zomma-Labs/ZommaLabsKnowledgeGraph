      "expected": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "answer": "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\u2019s Summary of Economic Activity for the mid\u2011August to September 2025 reporting period, overall economic activity in the Twelfth District edged down slightly relative to the prior period [2025-10-15 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity].\n\nContacts in the District reported that their economic outlook weakened somewhat compared with the previous reporting period [2025-10-15 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity]. Within this overall slight softening:\n\n- Employment levels were little changed on net, with most employers holding headcounts steady [2025-10-15 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity].\n- Wages grew slightly overall, with ongoing wage pressures for highly specialized positions in AI technology and some lower-wage jobs in construction and manufacturing [2025-10-15 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Labor Markets; 2025-10-15 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity].\n- Prices in the District rose modestly [2025-10-15 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity].\n- Consumer and business services conditions were mixed, and retail trade activity decreased somewhat [2025-10-15 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity].\n- Residential real estate activity decreased somewhat, while commercial real estate activity was unchanged on balance; new commercial construction remained subdued overall but was buoyed by public and private infrastructure projects such as data centers and health facilities [2025-10-15 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity; 2025-10-15 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Real Estate and Construction].\n- Conditions in agriculture and other resource-related sectors weakened slightly, similar to the prior reporting period [2025-10-15 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity; 2025-10-15 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries].\n- Lending activity remained largely stable, and commercial real estate activity was unchanged on balance [2025-10-15 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity].\n\nOverall, during mid\u2011August to September 2025, the Twelfth District experienced a slight edging down of economic activity, characterized by broadly stable employment, modest wage and price increases, weakening in resource-related sectors, softer retail and residential real estate, and generally mixed conditions across services, while business sentiment and outlooks became somewhat more pessimistic relative to the prior period [2025-10-15 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity].",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is that in the Twelfth District (San Francisco), economic activity edged down slightly, and that retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or were stable. The agent correctly states overall activity edged down slightly and notes retail trade decreased, residential real estate decreased, and agriculture weakened slightly. However, the agent adds substantial extra details (employment, wages, prices, lending, services) not asked for, and does not clearly reflect the \u201ceither decreased or remained stable\u201d framing (it states decreases/weakening rather than decreased-or-stable).

      "answer": "Auto sales in some Federal Reserve Districts were boosted mainly by:\n\n1. **A rush to buy electric vehicles before a federal tax credit expired**  \n   - The Beige Book\u2019s national summary reports that \u201cauto sales were boosted in some Districts in recent weeks by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September.\u201d  \n   - Philadelphia District contacts said auto sales \u201cwould have fallen by more if not for a rush to buy electric vehicles before the expiration of a federal EV tax credit at the end of September,\u201d and attributed the mitigation of the decline in auto sales to this EV rush.  \n   - The Chicago District noted that new light vehicle sales were \u201cbrisk due to the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases during the reporting period.\u201d  \n   - The Boston District reported that in New Hampshire \u201cthe rush to purchase electric vehicles before the expiration of tax credits drove the modest increase in auto sales.\u201d\n\n2. **Increased incentives on autos**  \n   - The Philadelphia District reported that \u201ccontacts reported increased incentives on autos,\u201d which contributed to supporting auto sales.\n\n3. **Modestly rising auto loan volumes and solid demand at dealers in some areas**  \n   - The Philadelphia District noted that \u201cDistrict banks reported that auto loans rose modestly.\u201d  \n   - In the New York District, auto dealers in upstate New York reported that auto sales \u201cedged up slightly,\u201d with \u201csolid demand\u201d and \u201chealthy inventory levels\u201d supporting optimism despite affordability concerns.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is specifically that auto sales were boosted by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September. The agent includes this key point (and supports it with District examples), so that part is correct. However, the agent adds additional factors (increased incentives, rising auto loans, solid demand/inventory) that are not part of the expected answer to the question as framed, making the response not strictly aligned with the expected single-cause answer.",

      "question": "How did lower- and middle-income households respond to economic conditions?",
      "expected": "Lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty.",
      "answer": "Lower- and middle-income households both faced worsening pressure from high inflation and higher interest rates, but their responses differed in severity and form.\n\n**Lower-income (low- and moderate-income) households**\n\n- **Strain on basic necessities and bills**\n  - In the Boston Fed\u2019s First District, low- and moderate-income households experienced **increased difficulty paying rent and utilities** and were seen as facing rising risks from further price increases and planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid.  \n  - Contacts there reported **growing concerns and anxiety** about the economic security of lower-income households.  \n  - A Kansas City Fed banking survey noted that customers with **lower personal incomes** are \u201camong the most likely to face challenges.\u201d\n\n- **Greater reliance on assistance**\n  - The St. Louis Fed reported **rising food pantry usage** among low-income (and also middle-income) households.  \n  - The San Francisco Fed reported **increased demand for assistance for food and basic household necessities** at community organizations.\n\n- **Financial stress and borrowing**\n  - In the St. Louis District, a banker reported more people going to **credit counseling agencies after borrowing to maintain their level of spending**, indicating that some lower-income consumers used debt to cope with higher costs.\n  - Across several districts, **consumer loan delinquencies** (including mortgages, home equity, and credit cards) increased modestly; Kansas City contacts expected consumer lending portfolios to face further challenges as disposable income declines, particularly for **lower-income customers**.\n\n- **Labor market experiences**\n  - Cleveland Fed community contacts who assist jobseekers observed clients increasingly receiving offers for **part-time positions with little or no benefits**, and the national Beige Book noted some employers favoring **temporary and part-time** over full\u2011time hiring. These conditions particularly affect lower-income jobseekers.\n\n**Middle-income households**\n\n- **Cautious but sustained spending**\n  - The St. Louis Fed reported that **middle-income consumers are increasingly cautious while maintaining their spending levels**.\n  - A Minneapolis Fed mall contact said consumers are **looking for value, deals, and ways to stretch their dollars**, indicating active efforts to economize rather than sharply cutting total spending.\n  - Kansas City Fed contacts noted that household consumption has become **more volatile due to heightened price sensitivity**, consistent with more careful, reactive spending behavior.\n\n- **Signs of financial strain**\n  - St. Louis Fed community contacts observed **rising food pantry usage among both low- and middle-income households** and **elevated credit card delinquency rates**, indicating that some middle-income households are also struggling to cover expenses and service debt.\n  - A banker in the St. Louis District reported more people (not specified by income, but consistent with stressed middle-income borrowers) seeking **credit counseling after borrowing to maintain spending**.\n\n- **Housing and \u201cmiddle-class recession\u201d**\n  - In the Philadelphia District, a realtor reported that **would-be homeowners have been priced out of the homebuying market**, and that these would-be buyers are driving **historically high demand in the local rental market**; this pricing-out effect is consistent with pressures on many middle-income households.\n  - A hotel owner in Missouri (St. Louis Fed) described conditions as a **\u201cmiddle-class recession,\u201d** reflecting weaker demand from the middle-income clientele segment.\n\n**Comparative summary**\n\n- **Severity of impact:**\n  - Lower-income households, as described by the Boston and Kansas City Feds, are more likely to face **immediate hardship**\u2014difficulty paying rent and utilities, heightened food insecurity, and dependence on assistance programs. Planned benefit cuts (SNAP, Medicaid) and further price increases are identified as particular **risks** for these households.\n  - Middle-income households, per St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia Feds, are more often **tightening belts and trading down**\u2014staying in the market but seeking deals, stretching dollars, and, in housing, being **pushed into renting** due to being priced out of ownership.\n\n- **Use of credit and delinquencies:**\n  - Both groups show evidence of **borrowing to maintain spending** and rising **credit card and consumer loan delinquencies**, but Kansas City Fed respondents specifically highlight **lower-income customers** as most likely to face difficulties, suggesting relatively greater vulnerability among lower-income households.\n\n- **Assistance and coping mechanisms:**\n  - Lower-income households are more directly visible in **food pantry and social service demand**, while middle-income households are described as **value-seeking and cautious** consumers, with some also turning to food pantries and credit counseling as conditions worsen.\n\nOverall, in the period described by the Federal Reserve District reports, lower-income households primarily responded by struggling to meet basic needs, increasing reliance on assistance, and experiencing acute financial stress, whereas middle-income households responded by becoming more cautious and price-sensitive, maintaining overall spending where possible, but showing rising signs of strain in food assistance usage, credit delinquencies, and reduced access to homeownership.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is that lower- and middle-income households responded by seeking discounts and promotions (value-seeking behavior) amid rising prices and uncertainty. The agent includes this idea for middle-income households (\"looking for value, deals\" / price sensitivity) and mentions trading down, which aligns with the core expected response. However, the agent\u2019s answer is much broader and emphasizes hardship, assistance usage, delinquencies, and other conditions; it does not clearly state that both lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts/promotions. Because the key point is only partially and inconsistently covered (mainly for middle-income, not explicitly for both), it is partially correct.",

      "question": "How did spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel perform?",
      "expected": "Spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong.",
      "answer": "Spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel has remained resilient and comparatively strong in the most recent period described (through October 2025), despite broader economic headwinds.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, **upper\u2011income households \u201ccontinue to spend on travel, events, and luxury services\u201d** [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis \u2013 Consumer Spending, 2025-10-15]. The same source notes that **corporate clients also continue to spend on travel and luxury services**, reinforcing ongoing strength at the upper end of the market.\n\nTourism contacts cited by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston reported **\u201ca widening gap in demand between luxury accommodations and budget\u2011friendly accommodations\u201d** [Boston \u2013 Retail and Tourism, 2025-10-15]. This indicates that demand for luxury lodging is holding up better than for lower-priced options.\n\nAdditional context from multiple Federal Reserve Districts shows that:\n\n- **Retail sales of luxury goods \u201ccontinued to perform well\u201d** over the reporting period [San Francisco \u2013 Retail Trade and Services, 2025-10-15], consistent with strong discretionary spending by affluent consumers.\n- **Cruising \u201cremained the strongest segment\u201d and passenger volumes in cruising were solid** [Atlanta \u2013 Consumer Spending, 2025-10-15], pointing to particular strength in a key luxury/premium travel category.\n- While some Fed Districts reported **softness in general travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels** [Chicago \u2013 Consumer Spending, 2025-10-15; San Francisco \u2013 Retail Trade and Services, 2025-10-15], these comments refer to overall leisure and hospitality sales rather than specifically to high-income or luxury segments.\n\nAt the same time, **middle\u2011income consumers are described as \u201cincreasingly cautious\u201d** [St. Louis \u2013 Consumer Spending, 2025-10-15], and several districts report curtailed vacation spending and softer demand for more affordable options [Minneapolis \u2013 Consumer Spending, 2025-10-15; San Francisco \u2013 Retail Trade and Services, 2025-10-15]. This contrast supports the conclusion that **macroeconomic pressures are weighing more on mass\u2011market travel than on luxury travel by higher\u2011income households**.\n\nPutting these findings together:  \nOver the latest reporting period, **spending by higher\u2011income individuals on luxury travel performed well and remained resilient**, with continued strong outlays on travel and luxury services, robust demand for luxury accommodations and cruising, and a clear divergence in favor of luxury relative to budget travel.",

      "question": "What happened to demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers?",
      "expected": "Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period.",
      "answer": "Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers declined further over the most recent reporting period.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve\u2019s National Summary dated 2025\u201110\u201115, \u201cdemand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period.\u201d At the same time, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta reported that \u201cthe volume of international visitors remained muted,\u201d and tourism firms in the Minneapolis District said revenue was lower than a year earlier and expected lower foot traffic, revenue, and profits to persist through year\u2011end, with increasing pressure on margins (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Consumer Spending, 2025\u201110\u201115).\n\nRelated indicators were consistent with weaker international\u2011travel demand: the Atlanta Fed noted that hotel occupancy levels \u201ccontinued to trend downward, on net,\u201d and travel\u2011related categories such as hotels showed \u201csoftness\u201d within leisure and hospitality sales (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Consumer Spending, 2025\u201110\u201115). In New York City, a \u201cmodest decline in international visitors\u201d had taken a toll on attractions and restaurants (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Services, 2025\u201110\u201115).\n\nSome offsetting support came from other segments: the Boston Fed reported that domestic travel and other international travel (outside of Canada) \u201ccompensated for the decline in Canadian visitors,\u201d allowing tourism\u2011related spending to \u201cincrease modestly overall\u201d despite the sharp drop in Canadian travelers (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Retail and Tourism, 2025\u201110\u201115). However, these gains did not prevent the specific category of demand from international travelers from falling further.\n\nOverall, across these Federal Reserve sources as of October 15, 2025, demand for leisure and hospitality services from international travelers had weakened further, with muted visitor volumes, lower tourism revenues compared with a year earlier, and declining hotel occupancy, even as domestic and some non\u2011Canadian international travel provided partial compensation in certain regions.",

      "question": "How did demand from domestic consumers for leisure and hospitality change?",
      "expected": "Demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged.",
      "answer": "Demand from domestic U.S. consumers for leisure and hospitality has become weaker and more uneven, with clear differences across segments:\n\n- **Overall softness and moderation:** Multiple Federal Reserve Banks report that leisure and hospitality \u201cexhibited weakness,\u201d with \u201cdemand for hospitality services\u201d and \u201ctravel-related categories\u201d (hotels and airlines) showing softness and declining further in recent reporting periods (Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas, San Francisco, Chicago; National Summary, 2025-10-15).\n\n- **Restaurants: higher volumes but more value-conscious behavior**\n  - Spending at restaurants increased within leisure and hospitality sales, with particular growth in the fast-food segment (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, 2025-10-15).\n  - At the same time, demand for restaurants as consumer-facing properties has softened in real estate markets (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, 2025-10-15), and consumers are pulling back within visits by skipping desserts and alcoholic beverages (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 2025-10-15).\n  - Casual sit-down restaurants report softening sales, while luxury and quick-service restaurants see solid revenue growth, indicating a bifurcation of demand (Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and San Francisco, 2025-10-15).\n\n- **Hotels and broader travel: declining demand**\n  - Hotel demand has softened, with hotel occupancy levels trending downward on net and average revenue per room lower across most of at least one Federal Reserve District (Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Minneapolis, 2025-10-15).\n  - Contacts report lower hotel room rates and softening demand for hotels as part of broader weakness in consumer-facing properties (Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and Cleveland, 2025-10-15).\n  - Leisure travel in some regions \u201ccontinued to soften,\u201d and tourism activity decreased, with shorter or closer-to-home trips indicated by a decline in average distance traveled for leisure trips (Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia, 2025-10-15).\n\n- **Air travel: mixed, with domestic leisure important but softening**\n  - Airlines have at times highlighted domestic travel as a source of strength and reported broad-based increases in passenger demand (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2025-10-15).\n  - However, in the most recent reports, airlines are also cited among travel-related categories showing softness in leisure and hospitality sales (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, 2025-10-15).\n\n- **Domestic vs. international components:**\n  - Domestic travel has supported tourism-related spending in some regions, partially compensating for weaker international and Canadian visitor flows (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, 2025-10-15).\n  - Nonetheless, the National Summary notes that demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, so overall sector demand is under pressure (National Summary, 2025-10-15).\n\n- **Business expectations and employment signals:**\n  - Hospitality and tourism firms report lower revenue relative to a year ago, expect lower foot traffic, revenue, and profits to persist, and are mainly hiring only to replace turnover rather than to expand staff (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 2025-10-15).\n  - Firms in the leisure and hospitality sector in at least one region experienced moderate declines in activity, even as they saw strong wage growth (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2025-10-15).\n\nPutting these findings together, since 2019 and especially in the most recent period, domestic consumer demand for U.S. leisure and hospitality has shifted from the broad, strong rebound phase after COVID-19 toward a **more cautious and segmented pattern**: restaurant and some entertainment spending (especially fast food and luxury) has increased, but consumers are trading down within visits; hotel, airline, and broader leisure travel demand has softened; and many hospitality businesses report weaker revenues and expect continued pressure.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is that demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. The agent instead claims domestic demand became weaker and more uneven/softened across segments, which contradicts the expected response.",
