      "question": "What are the main products/services that remain direct components of Google under Alphabet?",
      "expected": "Android operating system, YouTube, and Google Search",
      "answer": "**Direct Answer**\n\nBased on the available evidence, the main products/services that remain direct components of Google (under Alphabet) are:\n\n1. **Google Search**  \n2. **The Android operating system**  \n3. **YouTube**  \n\nAll three are described as \u201cwidely used products and services long associated with Google\u201d that \u201cremain direct components of Google\u201d within Alphabet\u2019s structure. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 5e629bf3-677d-4485-b09e-3ef66aacf497]\n\n---\n\n**Supporting Evidence**\n\n- The evidence explains that after Alphabet\u2019s restructuring, \u201cmany companies or divisions formerly a part of Google became subsidiaries of Alphabet,\u201d but **Google continues as the umbrella company for Alphabet\u2019s Internet-related businesses**. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 5e629bf3-677d-4485-b09e-3ef66aacf497]\n\n- It then specifies which widely used products and services remain directly within Google:  \n  > \u201cGoogle remains the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internetrelated businesses. These include widely used products and services long associated with Google, such as **the Android operating system, YouTube, and Google Search, which remain direct components of Google**.\u201d [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 5e629bf3-677d-4485-b09e-3ef66aacf497]\n\n---\n\n**Caveats**\n\n- The evidence explicitly names only **Android**, **YouTube**, and **Google Search** as remaining direct components of Google. It refers to these as examples (\u201csuch as\u201d), so there may be additional Google products/services in this category, but the evidence does not list them. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 5e629bf3-677d-4485-b09e-3ef66aacf497]\n\n- No other chunks were provided, so any further detail about other products or organizational nuances cannot be confirmed from this evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Confidence**\n\n- **High confidence** that Android, YouTube, and Google Search remain direct components of Google under Alphabet, as this is stated explicitly in the provided evidence. [DOC: N/A, CHUNK: 5e629bf3-677d-4485-b09e-3ef66aacf497]",
