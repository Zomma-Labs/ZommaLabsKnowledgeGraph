The system answer states: it is an Alphabet Inc. subsidiary that holds Alphabet’s equity, explains the Roman numeral 26 / letters in the alphabet, and says it was created so Alphabet’s businesses could be valued and legally separated from Google.

Around 12,000 jobs were cut, which reduced the company's workforce by 6%.[90] According to various posts on social media, several Google employees discovered they had been terminated after they were unable to access their accounts and confirming it through news articles discussing the mass layoffs.[91][92][93]",

The chip solved a complex problem in five minutes, a task that would take a classical computer longer than the age of the universe. Willow reduces error rates in quantum computing and can correct them in real time, which could lead to breakthroughs in science, medicine, and finance. Alphabet's stock was up 25% for the year, marking its best day since April 2024.[26] On 15 September 2025, Alphabet became the fourth company—trailing Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple—to top $3 trillion in market cap.[27] At the time, shares were up more than 32% for the year amid optimism for AI adoption and a more-favorable-than-expected antitrust ruling that did not require the company to divest its Chrome browser platform.[28]",

The settlement amounted to less than 0.7% of Alphabet Inc.'s yearly earnings.[86] On June 12, 2021, it was announced that Japan would launch an antitrust probe into Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc. to determine whether their dealings with Japanese smartphone makers violate current antitrust measures or could necessitate new ones.[87] In May 2022, Russian authorities seized Google's Russian bank account,[88] forcing them to file for bankruptcy one month later due to the inability to pay vendors and staff. However, free services such as Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Android and Play were to remain available.[89] In 2023, the company was criticized for conducting mass lay-offs without informing employees before they arrived to work, including many long-tenured and recently promoted employees. Around 12,000 jobs were cut, which reduced the company's workforce by 6%.[90] According to various posts on social media, several Google employees discovered they had been terminated after they were unable to access their accounts and confirming it through news articles discussing the mass layoffs.[91][92][93]",

The system answer: states Alphabet via Waymo sued Uber in 2017 alleging Uber used technology stolen from Waymo’s proprietary self‑driving car program, specifically trade secrets in about 14,000 internal Waymo documents allegedly taken by a former Waymo engineer when he joined Uber. All key elements match: self‑driving tech, proprietary/trade secrets, ~14,000 documents, former Waymo engineer who moved to Uber, and the 2017 lawsuit. No contradictions or errors. This is fully correct and slightly more explicit but aligned with the ground truth.",

Google co-founder and CEO Larry Page made this announcement in a blog post on Google's official blog.[10] Alphabet was created to restructure Google by moving subsidiaries from Google to Alphabet, thus narrowing Google's scope. The new holding company would consist of Google as well as other businesses including X Development, Calico, Nest, Verily, Fiber, CapitalG, and GV.[11][12][13] Sundar Pichai, the company's Product Chief, became the new chief executive officer of Google, replacing Page, who transitioned to the role of running Alphabet, along with co-founder Sergey Brin.[14][15]",

However, free services such as Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Android and Play were to remain available.[89] In 2023, the company was criticized for conducting mass lay-offs without informing employees before they arrived to work, including many long-tenured and recently promoted employees. Around 12,000 jobs were cut, which reduced the company's workforce by 6%.[90] According to various posts on social media, several Google employees discovered they had been terminated after they were unable to access their accounts and confirming it through news articles discussing the mass layoffs.[91][92][93]",

The employees in question were fired for unionization attempts and protesting company policies. The board also alleges that Google unlawfully placed employees on administrative leave in retribution.

In October 2022, Alphabet recorded the weakest quarterly growth, with fewer sales in nearly a decade. The possible global recession, the strong U.S. dollar, and the pandemics all contributed to the slowed economy.[69] In 2022, Alphabet was the company with the second-highest expenditure on research and development worldwide, with R&D expenditure amounting to US$39.5 billion.[70] In 2023, Alphabet was ranked 7th in the Global 2000 (World's Largest Public Companies).[71]",

He also said that he was currently meeting with the CEOs of the current and proposed Alphabet subsidiaries. He said, \"You'll see a lot coming.\"[36] While many companies or divisions formerly a part of Google became subsidiaries of Alphabet, Google remains the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet-related businesses.

However, free services such as Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Android and Play were to remain available.[89] In 2023, the company was criticized for conducting mass lay-offs without informing employees before they arrived to work, including many long-tenured and recently promoted employees. Around 12,000 jobs were cut, which reduced the company's workforce by 6%.[90] According to various posts on social media, several Google employees discovered they had been terminated after they were unable to access their accounts and confirming it through news articles discussing the mass layoffs.[91][92][93]",
