      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected_answer": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "system_answer": "## Overview of Economic Activity in the Twelfth District\n\nEconomic activity in the Twelfth District, overseen by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, edged down slightly during the most recent reporting period (mid-August to early October 2025). This modest decline reflects a combination of sector-specific slowdowns and broader regional challenges. The Twelfth District encompasses a large and diverse area, including Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington, making its economic trends significant for the western United States [Data: Entities (102, 64, 76); Relationships (1013, 82, 124, 65)].\n\n## Sectoral Developments\n\n- **Labor Markets:** Employment levels were little changed overall, with most employers maintaining steady head counts and hiring primarily to replace departing workers. However, some sectors, notably manufacturing and health care, experienced staff reductions through attrition, layoffs, and early retirements [Data: Sources (18); Entities (1220, 1221); Relationships (1016, 1017, 1033)].\n- **Wages and Prices:** Wages grew slightly, and prices rose modestly, indicating ongoing but moderate inflationary pressures in the region [Data: Sources (18); Relationships (1034)].\n- **Retail and Real Estate:** Activity in retail trade and residential real estate decreased somewhat, while commercial real estate activity remained unchanged on balance. The construction sector saw subdued new commercial construction, with some support from infrastructure projects [Data: Sources (18); Relationships (1037, 1040, 1041, 1042)].\n- **Manufacturing and Lending:** Manufacturing and lending activity remained largely stable, with no significant changes reported in these sectors [Data: Sources (18); Relationships (1038, 1079)].\n- **Agriculture and Resources:** Conditions in agriculture and resource-related sectors weakened slightly, reflecting challenges such as adverse weather and market conditions [Data: Sources (18); Relationships (1039)].\n- **Community and Small Businesses:** Both small businesses and community support organizations faced weakened conditions, with small businesses experiencing reduced demand and financial strain, and community organizations contending with increased demand for services amid funding cuts [Data: Reports (5); Relationships (1035, 1036)].\n\n## Regional and Outlook Commentary\n\nThe overall economic outlook in the Twelfth District weakened somewhat compared to the prior reporting period. Contacts cited heightened uncertainty and downside risks, including the potential for a government shutdown, which could further disrupt economic activity. Despite some areas of stability, such as commercial real estate and lending, the general trend was one of modest contraction or stagnation across key sectors [Data: Reports (5); Entities (250, 8); Relationships (1080, 1012, 25)].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the Twelfth District experienced a slight decline in economic activity, with particular softness in retail, residential real estate, agriculture, and among small businesses and community organizations. Employment and wages were largely stable, but the overall outlook has become more cautious amid ongoing uncertainties [Data: Sources (18); Reports (5); Entities (64, 102, 250, 8); Relationships (1012, 1080, 1033, 1034, 1035, 1036, 1037, 1040, 1041, 1042, 1038, 1079, 1039, 25, +more)].",

      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Economic activity in the Twelfth District (San Francisco) edged down slightly.\n2) Activity in retail trade either decreased or remained stable.\n3) Activity in agriculture either decreased or remained stable.\n4) Activity in residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.\n\nComparison:\n1) The system answer explicitly states that economic activity in the Twelfth District \"edged down slightly\" and describes it as a \"slight decline\" and \"modest contraction\" → matches fact 1.\n2) It says: \"Activity in retail trade and residential real estate decreased somewhat\" → this is consistent with \"either decreased or remained stable\" → matches facts 2 and 4.\n3) It says: \"Conditions in agriculture and resource-related sectors weakened slightly\" → consistent with decreased activity in agriculture → matches fact 3.\n4) There are additional sector details (labor markets, wages, manufacturing, lending, small businesses, etc.), but none contradict the ground truth.\n\nAll key facts are present and correctly stated; no contradictions with the expected answer. The answer is more detailed but still aligned.\n\nVerdict: correct.",

      "question": "What is the Beige Book?",
      "expected_answer": "The Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication about current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It characterizes regional economic conditions and prospects based on a variety of mostly qualitative information, gathered directly from each District's sources.",
      "system_answer": "## Overview of the Beige Book\n\nThe Beige Book is a publication of the Federal Reserve System that provides a summary of current economic conditions across the twelve Federal Reserve Districts. It is released eight times per year and is based primarily on qualitative information gathered directly from a wide range of sources within each District, including businesses, community organizations, economists, and market experts. The Beige Book is designed to characterize changes in economic conditions since the previous report and to offer insights into regional economic trends and developments [Data: Entities (0, 53, 54, 120); Relationships (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 79, 80); Sources (0)].\n\n## Purpose and Use\n\nThe main purpose of the Beige Book is to supplement the data and analysis used by Federal Reserve economists and staff to assess economic conditions in the Federal Reserve Districts. Its qualitative nature allows the Federal Reserve to identify emerging trends and dynamics in the economy that may not be immediately apparent in quantitative data. The information collected through the Beige Book helps policymakers compare economic conditions in different parts of the country and informs the outlook for the national economy. Importantly, the Beige Book is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials, but rather a summary of information collected from external contacts [Data: Sources (0); Entities (0, 120); Relationships (0, 79)].\n\n## Information Collection Process\n\nEach Federal Reserve Bank gathers information for the Beige Book through reports from Bank and Branch directors, as well as interviews and online questionnaires completed by a curated set of contacts. These contacts are selected to provide accurate and objective information about a broad range of economic activities. The process is not random; instead, it aims to ensure diversity and comprehensiveness in the perspectives represented. The resulting report serves as a regular public summary of this information [Data: Sources (0); Entities (0, 120); Relationships (0, 79)].\n\n## Significance\n\nThe Beige Book is a key tool for the Federal Reserve in monitoring and understanding the U.S. economy. It complements other forms of regional information gathering, such as surveys and statistical releases, and is widely regarded by policymakers, economists, and market participants for its timely and comprehensive economic insights [Data: Reports (5); Entities (0, 53, 54, 120); Relationships (0, 5, 6, 79, 80)].\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Beige Book is a qualitative economic report published by the Federal Reserve System eight times a year, summarizing regional economic conditions across the twelve Federal Reserve Districts. It is based on information collected from a diverse set of contacts and is used to inform monetary policy and provide insights into emerging economic trends [Data: Sources (0); Entities (0, 120); Relationships (0, 79, 80)].",
