      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is that Twelfth District (San Francisco) economic activity edged down slightly, with retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate decreasing or remaining stable. The agent states overall activity edged down slightly and explicitly notes retail trade decreased, residential real estate decreased, and agriculture weakened/decreased. This matches the key facts.",

      "question": "What is the Beige Book?",
      "expected": "The Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication about current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It characterizes regional economic conditions and prospects based on a variety of mostly qualitative information, gathered directly from each District's sources.",
      "answer": "The Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication that describes current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It is a regular summary for the public of information on current economic conditions gathered by Federal Reserve Banks through reports, interviews, and online questionnaires [2026-01-09 | About This Publication > What is the Beige Book?; How is the information collected?].\n\nIts purpose is to characterize the change in economic conditions since the last report and to provide a qualitative summary that helps identify emerging trends in the economy [2026-01-09 | About This Publication > What is the purpose of the Beige Book?; How is the information used?]. The information is collected from a wide range of contacts, and this outreach is one of the ways the Federal Reserve System engages with businesses and other organizations about economic developments in their communities [2026-01-09 | About This Publication > What is the purpose of the Beige Book?].\n\nThe Beige Book is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials; instead, it summarizes reports from the Federal Reserve Districts on current economic conditions [2026-01-09 | About This Publication > What is the purpose of the Beige Book?; National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Philadelphia].",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The agent states that the Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication describing current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts and that it is based on (mostly qualitative) information gathered from District sources. This matches the expected definition; the added details do not contradict it.",

      "expected": "Economic activity changed little on balance since the previous report, with three Districts reporting slight to modest growth in activity, five reporting no change, and four noting a slight softening.",
      "answer": "According to the October 2025 Beige Book\u2019s national summary on overall economic activity:\n\n- Conditions were mixed across Federal Reserve Districts.  \n- Three Districts reported **slight to modest growth** in activity since the previous report.  \n- Four Districts noted a **slight softening** in activity over the same period.  \n- At least one District (the Eleventh) reported activity as **little changed** over the reporting period.  \n- The **outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector**, with some areas showing optimism (e.g., expectations for higher future sales and employment in the Kansas City District) while others saw mostly downside risks or elevated uncertainty weighing on expected activity.\n\nIn sum, the October 2025 Beige Book described overall U.S. economic activity as neither uniformly expanding nor contracting, but **mixed**, with modest increases in some regions offset by slight declines or softening in others and a varied, uncertain outlook.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly included that three Districts reported slight to modest growth and four noted slight softening, matching key parts of the expected answer. However, it did not state that five Districts reported no change; instead it vaguely says \u201cat least one District \u2026 little changed,\u201d which is incomplete and does not capture the on-balance conclusion (\u201cchanged little on balance\u201d) with the correct District count breakdown.",
