      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The agent\u2019s answer is an API error message and does not address how economic activity changed in the Twelfth District (San Francisco).

      "expected": "The Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication about current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It characterizes regional economic conditions and prospects based on a variety of mostly qualitative information, gathered directly from each District's sources.",

      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The agent did not provide any substantive answer about the Beige Book; it returned an API error message instead. Therefore it does not address the question or include the expected facts.",
