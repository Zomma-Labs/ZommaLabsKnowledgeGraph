It omits the sector‑specific details about retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate, but does not contradict them or introduce any errors.

Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months.

Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months.

Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

Hotel occupancy and average revenue per room were lower across most of the District. A mall contact said that \"one message we are picking up from our consumers and tenants is that the consumer is looking for value, deals, and ways to stretch their dollars.\"",

Nonetheless, tourism-related spending increased modestly overall, as domestic and other international travel compensated for the decline in Canadian visitors.

Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months.

Tourism contacts noted a widening gap in demand between luxury and budget-friendly accommodations, where overall growth was fueled almost entirely by the former. Hotel occupancy rates for greater Boston and Cape Cod increased slightly in August from a year earlier. Retailers and restaurants across Cape Cod, coastal New Hampshire, and Maine reported that summer spending totals rose moderately from the previous year owing to an increase in the number of day trips. The number of Canadian travelers to New England remained down sharply from the previous year, and certain parts of Cape Cod and Maine experienced weaker summer tourism activity (from the previous year) as a result. Nonetheless, tourism-related spending increased modestly overall, as domestic and other international travel compensated for the decline in Canadian visitors. Auto sales in New Hampshire increased modestly from last month, driven by the rush to purchase electric vehicles before the expiration of tax credits. The outlook shifted from pessimistic to neutral among retail and tourism contacts, although contacts said that considerable uncertainty remained.",

      "system_answer": "According to the October 2025 Beige Book excerpts provided, manufacturing conditions were:\n\n- **Nationally mixed but generally soft to slightly positive**, with many districts reporting flat to modest changes in activity and continuing uncertainty, especially around tariffs and trade policy.\n\nBy district:\n\n- **Boston:** Manufacturing sales rose modestly; capital spending was unchanged; uncertainty was elevated, and the outlook for 2026 was somewhat weaker due to tariffs, inflation, and general uncertainty.\n- **New York:** Manufacturing activity was little changed; new orders down, shipments mostly flat; input prices elevated and some procurement difficulties; overseas demand weakened; inventories shrank; capital spending plans were soft, though firms expected improvement ahead.\n- **Philadelphia:** Manufacturing activity increased moderately, with new orders and shipments rising moderately and remaining above historical averages.\n- **Cleveland:** Demand for manufactured goods declined modestly; weakness tied to tariffs and trade-policy uncertainty; industrial and agricultural equipment demand particularly weak, while orders related to fossil fuel and electricity (including data centers) were stronger; firms expected moderate demand increases ahead.\n- **Richmond:** Manufacturing declined slightly; customers were more price-sensitive; firms cut costs, customers traded down or delayed purchases; housing-related manufacturers (construction, furniture) were negatively affected, with tariffs worsening conditions for furniture.\n- **Atlanta:** Manufacturing rose slightly on net; conditions varied by product (solid for cosmetics and concrete, flat or lackluster for paper, pulp, and some tire components; weaker for packaged snacks amid softer demand and some price hikes); concerns over tariffs and rising costs were prevalent.\n- **Chicago:** Manufacturing demand declined modestly; steel orders flat; fabricated metals flat on balance; machinery orders down moderately; auto production down modestly, heavy truck production flat.\n- **St. Louis:** Manufacturing activity declined slightly; some firms saw lower sales or inquiries; some were adding regional facilities to cut shipping/logistics costs, while others offshored due to labor challenges; firms sought cost-effective strategies to manage tariffs, shipping, and labor.\n- **Minneapolis:** Manufacturing was flat on balance; roughly equal shares of firms reported higher and lower orders; regional index showed declines in Minnesota and South Dakota, increase in North Dakota; metal and equipment-part producers saw slower orders; home furnishings were mixed.\n- **Kansas City:** Manufacturing increased slightly, helped by clearer expectations around tariffs; high input costs remained but had eased from “boil to a simmer”; better-capitalized and less import-exposed firms gained market share; domestic manufacturers benefited somewhat from eroding foreign cost advantages; contacts expected more favorable conditions next year.\n- **Dallas:** Factory output growth slowed to a modest pace; new orders dipped; durables slowed except for machinery and transportation; food manufacturing strong, chemicals steady but pressured by trade policy and global oversupply; refineries saw seasonal and outage-related dips; overall outlook worsened due to slowing demand, inflation, and policy uncertainty.\n- **San Francisco:** Manufacturing was largely stable; demand strong for automated equipment but weaker for some furniture; some excess capacity emerged; materials were generally available but more expensive (including utilities and chips); one Hawaii manufacturer reported higher prices but reduced payroll and output; auto-sector investment was constrained by higher tariff costs.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key fact in the expected answer: \n1) Manufacturing activity varied by District.\n2) Most reports noted challenging conditions.\n3) The challenges were specifically due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand.\n\nCheck system answer:\n1) It clearly states conditions varied by district and then gives a district-by-district breakdown – this matches “varied by District.”\n2) It characterizes conditions as “nationally mixed but generally soft to slightly positive, with many districts reporting flat to modest changes in activity and continuing uncertainty, especially around tariffs and trade policy.” It repeatedly notes softness, flat activity, declines, cost pressures, and uncertainty throughout districts. This aligns with “challenging conditions,” and the overall tone is not strong growth.\n3) It explicitly mentions tariffs and trade policy uncertainty in multiple places (nationally, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, San Francisco) and frequently notes weaker demand, slowing demand, or flat/lackluster demand. That corresponds to “higher tariffs and waning overall demand.”\n\nNo statements contradict the ground truth; the system answer is more detailed but consistent with the expected summary. Therefore it contains all key facts and adds accurate elaboration, with no evident errors relative to the ground truth.\n",

Machinery orders decreased moderately, driven by a decline in demand from the auto sector. Auto production was down modestly, while heavy truck production was flat.",
      "system_answer": "Manufacturing demand in the Chicago District was not driven by growth; it **declined modestly**, largely because of:\n\n- **Reduced demand from the auto sector**, which led to a moderate decrease in machinery orders.\n- **Lower sales to the construction and automotive industries** for fabricated metals.\n\nOverall, there is no specific positive driver cited; instead, weakness in auto and construction demand pulled manufacturing demand down.",

      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the ground truth:\n- Manufacturing demand declined modestly in late August and September.\n- Steel orders were flat overall.\n- Fabricated metals demand was unchanged on balance, with higher sales to a range of sectors offset by lower sales to construction and automotive.\n- Machinery orders decreased moderately, driven by a decline in demand from the auto sector.\n- Auto production was down modestly, heavy truck production was flat.\n\nSystem answer:\n- States manufacturing demand \"declined modestly\" – correct.\n- Notes reduced demand from the auto sector leading to a moderate decrease in machinery orders – correct.\n- Notes lower sales to construction and automotive industries for fabricated metals – partially correct (captures the negative side but omits the offsetting higher sales to other sectors, and omits that fabricated metals demand was unchanged on balance).\n- Frames the explanation as being about negative drivers and says no specific positive driver – this is consistent with the parts it mentions, but again omits the higher sales to other sectors.\n\nMissing elements:\n- No mention that steel orders were flat.\n- No mention that fabricated metals demand was unchanged on balance due to offsetting higher sales to other sectors.\n- No mention of auto production being down modestly and heavy truck production being flat.\n\nThere are no clear factual errors relative to what is stated in the ground truth; the system answer is incomplete and somewhat one-sided, but not contradictory. This fits \"partially correct\": some key facts (overall decline, auto-driven machinery decline, lower sales to construction/auto) are present; others (flat steel orders, balanced fabricated metals demand, auto/heavy-truck production details) are missing.\n",

Some firms, however, reported little to no tariff impacts thus far. A few service-oriented firms noted an ability to increase prices without pushback from customers. Steel prices flattened amid slower demand, but some producers held prices steady to preserve strong margins.

Surveys found softening labor demand among District employers, as well as declining head count, though seasonality played a role. A staffing firm with multiple offices saw hiring decline at the end of summer after an earlier uptick. A staffing contact in Michigan's Upper Peninsula noted healthy labor demand in manufacturing, construction, and mining, but acknowledged that \"the uncertainty in the market has spurred more temp and temp-to-hire work in our area,\" rather than direct hiring. Hospitality and tourism firms reported that they were predominantly hiring to replace turnover; only one in ten were hiring new full-time employees, and a comparable share was cutting workers. However, recent unemployment claims across the District remained low overall. Montana employers reported healthy labor demand, but a contact said that \"most hiring is to replace vacancies rather than support business expansion.\" Artificial intelligence was expected to have a slight dampening effect on future labor demand. A Minnesota advertising firm said there \"will be a smaller need for entry-level folks\" because Al tools \"get this work done faster.\"",

These are not in the ground truth but are not directly contradictory; they are just extra.\n\nThus, the answer contains one of the two key facts accurately but omits the other, making it incomplete yet not wrong.

The system answer explicitly states that wages increased in every reporting Federal Reserve District, and repeatedly characterizes the pace as modest or moderate (or similar wording like “slightly”/“in line with long‑run averages”). It adds district‑level detail that is consistent with, and does not contradict, the ground truth. There are no factual errors relative to the expected answer, and the core message is fully captured and even elaborated.\n\nTherefore, the system answer is fully correct with extra detail, not partially correct or incorrect, and it clearly did not abstain.",

Waning demand in some markets reportedly pushed prices down for some materials, such as steel in the Sixth District and lumber in the Twelfth District.",

Commercial real estate conditions were mixed by district and property type: overall activity ranged from flat to slightly improved in many places, but new construction was limited, office and some big-box spaces struggled, while sectors like retail (selectively), industrial, data centers, and medical/health facilities tended to show more resilience or growth.",

The crucial elements are: (1) overall characterization as “mixed,” and (2) the contrast between some improvement (via business lending tied to lower rates) and ongoing muted activity.\n\nThe system answer: \n- Describes residential real estate as generally soft/flat, with details on sales, listings, inventories, and prices.\n- Describes commercial real estate as mixed by district and property type, with flat to slightly improved activity overall, limited new construction, weaknesses in office/big box, and relative strength in some other subsectors.\n\nComparison:\n- It partially aligns with the idea of “mixed” conditions for commercial real estate and somewhat with “muted activity” where it notes flat/soft conditions and specific weaknesses.\n- However, it does not mention the key element of the expected answer: the role of lower interest rates and improved business lending in some reports. It shifts to a different, much more detailed characterization that is not in the ground truth.\n- It introduces detailed conditions (slower sales, inventories, specific subsector performance) that are not supported by the provided expected answer. Under the judging rubric, such added, specific characterizations are hallucinated relative to the ground truth context.\n\nThus, while there is a loose thematic overlap (“mixed” / some improvement vs some weakness), the answer is neither fully aligned with the expected, nor clearly correct relative to the given context; it is missing the key lending/interest-rate dimension and adds unsupported specifics. There are no direct contradictions of the ground truth, but the match is only partial and incomplete.\n\nTherefore the best classification is PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

Tourism contacts noted a widening gap in demand between luxury and budget-friendly accommodations, where overall growth was fueled almost entirely by the former. Hotel occupancy rates for greater Boston and Cape Cod increased slightly in August from a year earlier. Retailers and restaurants across Cape Cod, coastal New Hampshire, and Maine reported that summer spending totals rose moderately from the previous year owing to an increase in the number of day trips. The number of Canadian travelers to New England remained down sharply from the previous year, and certain parts of Cape Cod and Maine experienced weaker summer tourism activity (from the previous year) as a result. Nonetheless, tourism-related spending increased modestly overall, as domestic and other international travel compensated for the decline in Canadian visitors. Auto sales in New Hampshire increased modestly from last month, driven by the rush to purchase electric vehicles before the expiration of tax credits. The outlook shifted from pessimistic to neutral among retail and tourism contacts, although contacts said that considerable uncertainty remained.",

However, these added details are not verifiably false given only the ground truth; they are just unsupported.\n\nSince the answer includes some core elements (loosening conditions and rising bond/equity values) but omits others (unchanged volatility and decreased business loan demand) and does not clearly contradict them, it is best classified as partially correct rather than incorrect.",

Some areas had strong yields but still weak incomes because of low prices and high expenses.\n- **Livestock/Protein:** In contrast, protein and livestock sectors (cattle, hogs, poultry, beef) were relatively strong, with high prices and solid demand, though labor shortages constrained expansion in some cases.\n- **Financial stress:** Farm incomes and working capital were declining in many crop-heavy areas, credit conditions deteriorated gradually, and some contacts expected bankruptcies or exits from farming. Government support programs and crop insurance were described as critical safety nets.\n- **Trade and policy pressures:** Trade policy shifts—especially reduced purchases from China (notably soybeans) and volatility in exports—further weighed on crop producers.\n- **Costs and labor:** Producers faced rising input, packaging, and financing costs, and some regions reported labor shortages due to immigration policy changes, increasing operational strain.\n- **Outlook:** Overall outlook in agriculture was described as slightly pessimistic or weighed down by uncertainties (including potential La Niña and future input costs), limiting investment plans.",

This is consistent with \"energy grew moderately\" in the Atlanta District.\n- The system adds more detail about various districts and segments, but these details do not contradict the ground truth summary.\n\nAll key points of the expected answer are present and aligned: the overall down/weak trend and the Atlanta exception with moderate growth.

An oil field service contact noted there were \"a lot of rigs stacked in yards waiting to become spare parts.\" Several firms noted project delays due to low oil prices and an uncertain policy environment, but pipeline contacts were optimistic about their project pipelines crediting regulatory relief and favorable tax policies.",

Some Districts reported slightly improved or optimistic sentiment and expected modest growth over the next 6–12 months (or into 2026), but many contacts across Districts expected elevated uncertainty and various downside risks—such as tariffs, inflation, policy uncertainty, and possible government shutdown—to weigh on future activity.",

One minor extra phrase \"or into 2026\" goes beyond the ground truth, but it does not contradict it, and the core described horizon (next 6–12 months) is correct and present. There are no factual contradictions with the expected answer. Therefore the answer is fully consistent and complete with respect to the ground truth.\n",

Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong.

Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity.

Overall consumer spending, particularly on retail goods, inched down in recent weeks, although auto sales were boosted in some Districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September. Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

Tourism contacts noted a widening gap in demand between luxury and budget-friendly accommodations, where overall growth was fueled almost entirely by the former. Hotel occupancy rates for greater Boston and Cape Cod increased slightly in August from a year earlier. Retailers and restaurants across Cape Cod, coastal New Hampshire, and Maine reported that summer spending totals rose moderately from the previous year owing to an increase in the number of day trips. The number of Canadian travelers to New England remained down sharply from the previous year, and certain parts of Cape Cod and Maine experienced weaker summer tourism activity (from the previous year) as a result. Nonetheless, tourism-related spending increased modestly overall, as domestic and other international travel compensated for the decline in Canadian visitors. Auto sales in New Hampshire increased modestly from last month, driven by the rush to purchase electric vehicles before the expiration of tax credits. The outlook shifted from pessimistic to neutral among retail and tourism contacts, although contacts said that considerable uncertainty remained.",

Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

Businesses' reports on conditions were more mixed over the past month as strategic pricing behavior, different exposure to technology and policy shocks, and changing consumer preferences all led to shifts in market shares among competitors. Employment levels fell slightly overall, and bankers noted consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately. Prices rose at a moderate pace, and contacts reported they anticipate raising selling prices in 2026 at a slightly faster pace than this year. Despite the recent decline in economic activity, the majority of contacts across a broad range of sectors indicated they expect their sales and employment levels to be higher at the end of 2026 compared to 2025.",

Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.",

Overall, manufacturing in declining districts was flat to slightly moderating.",
      "system_answer": "In the districts where overall economic activity declined (Minneapolis, New York, San Francisco, Kansas City), manufacturing was reported as flat or little changed, rather than declining:\n\n- Minneapolis: “Manufacturing … was flat.”\n- New York: “Manufacturing activity was little changed.”\n- San Francisco: “Manufacturing … remained largely stable.”\n\nSo, in those districts, manufacturing generally held steady even as broader economic activity edged down.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the ground truth:\n1) Districts with declining overall economic activity: New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco.\n2) New York: manufacturing held steady / little changed after a summer uptick.\n3) Minneapolis: manufacturing was flat.\n4) Kansas City: manufacturing output growth moderated (i.e., still growing but at a slower pace, not flat).\n5) San Francisco: manufacturing remained stable / largely stable.\n6) Overall characterization: flat to slightly moderating.\n\nSystem answer comparison:\n- Correctly identifies the same four districts.\n- Correctly describes Minneapolis as “manufacturing … was flat.”\n- Correctly describes New York as “manufacturing activity was little changed” (equivalent to holding steady).\n- Correctly describes San Francisco as “manufacturing … remained largely stable.”\n- For Kansas City, the system only gives an overall summary (“manufacturing was reported as flat or little changed, rather than declining”) and omits the specific fact that in Kansas City, manufacturing output growth *moderated* rather than being flat. This makes the generic description slightly inaccurate for Kansas City, since moderating growth is not the same as flat/little changed.\n- The overall summary that manufacturing “generally held steady” in those districts matches the ground truth characterization of flat to slightly moderating, but it obscures the nuance of moderated growth in Kansas City and implicitly groups Kansas City into “flat or little changed.”\n\nThus, the answer captures most key points and has no blatant contradiction (manufacturing did not decline), but it is incomplete and somewhat imprecise with respect to Kansas City. That fits \"partially correct\": some key facts present, others missing/blurred, without clear factual contradiction based on the given ground truth.\n",

This matches the ground truth.\n- For lumber in the Twelfth District, the system notes decreased/eased prices and attributes this to slowing construction activity and increased competition allowing builders to negotiate lower prices. This is effectively restating waning demand in that market, so it is consistent with the expected answer.\n- However, the system then adds three more categories of materials and districts (construction materials in the Tenth District, retail fuel in the Ninth District, and certain agricultural products in the Ninth District) as if they are part of the answer to the question. The ground truth says only steel in the Sixth and lumber in the Twelfth are the relevant materials. These additional items are not in the expected answer and contradict the notion that only those two were the relevant materials. In this evaluation framework, introducing extra, conflicting \"only\" items counts as incorrect, not just extra harmless detail.\n\nBecause the system broadens the set of correct answers beyond what the ground truth defines and presents those additional decreases as part of \"the\" answer, it does not match the expected answer set and is therefore incorrect in this context, even though the two core items it mentions are accurate.\n",

Tariff-induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts, but the extent of those higher costs passing through to final prices varied. Some firms facing tariff-induced cost pressures kept their selling prices largely unchanged to preserve market share and in response to pushback from price-sensitive clients. However, there were also reports of firms in manufacturing and retail trades fully passing higher import costs along to their customers. Waning demand in some markets reportedly pushed prices down for some materials, such as steel in the Sixth District and lumber in the Twelfth District.",

That corresponds to seeking discounts/promotions and being constrained, aligning with point (2).\n- For middle‑income households, it notes increased caution, a “middle‑class recession,” reduced travel, and greater use of credit/BNPL, which is consistent with them being squeezed and not able to spend like higher‑income groups; while it doesn’t explicitly say “seeking discounts,” it doesn’t contradict it and still describes constrained, cautious behavior.\n- On drivers, it explicitly mentions income and financial buffer (higher‑income can absorb higher prices; low/middle must cut back or seek assistance), price inflation and tariffs disproportionately squeezing lower and middle income, and credit conditions and delinquencies, all of which align with the expected causal story: rising prices eroding purchasing power for lower/middle, higher‑income insulated. It adds more detail (tariffs, BNPL, assistance) but these are not contradictory.\n- No factual contradictions with the expected answer are evident; the system answer is more detailed but consistent with and inclusive of all key expected points.\n\nTherefore, the system answer fully captures the key facts and correct drivers, with extra consistent detail.",

However, it never claims AI is the sole cause; it just emphasizes AI as a contributing factor. This is incomplete rather than incorrect.\n- No clear factual contradictions with the ground truth are present; the examples (San Francisco, National Summary, etc.) are consistent with the described relationship: AI investment contributing to reduced headcount, especially for certain roles.\n\nBecause the answer accurately describes the core relationship (AI investment cited as contributing to reduced headcount/layoffs, muted employment growth, especially in some segments) but omits the context about other factors and the overall stability of employment, it is accurate but somewhat incomplete relative to the expected answer, not wrong or misleading.\n",

Several firms described what one dubbed a \"hiring chill,\" suggesting welcomed attrition and fewer head count additions in areas of growth. Turnover was low, with many describing the level as the lowest in their firm's history, and applicants for open positions were plentiful except for very specific, mostly technical, roles. Recently, however, head count reductions were cited more frequently, and some firms expect further cuts based on early Generative Al implementation results, particularly if demand slows further. Impacts from changes to immigration policy and enforcement were more material than previously reported but were concentrated in certain geographies like south Georgia and sectors such as agriculture and hospitality. Uncertainty around both labor supply and consumer demand continued to weigh on firms' hiring plans.",

It provides a very detailed characterization of sector conditions, labor/prices, and outlooks for these districts, which does not align with the entities and summary structure in the expected answer.\n\nWhile there is partial overlap for New York, Minneapolis, and Kansas City (and some of the described outlooks are conceptually similar: New York not expecting much activity increase; Kansas City optimistic for 2026; Minneapolis broad softening), the comparison the question asks for—\"between districts that saw growth versus those that saw decline\"—is not framed in terms of the correct district groupings from the expected answer. The system redefines the groups (growth/flat = Richmond, Cleveland, Atlanta, Dallas; decline = Minneapolis, New York, Kansas City) instead of using Boston and Philadelphia and including San Francisco in the decline group. This directly contradicts the expected classification of which districts are in which bucket.\n\nTherefore, key required facts (Boston and Philadelphia outlooks, San Francisco’s situation) are missing, and the answer’s grouping and detailed discussion are inconsistent with the expected answer. That is not just an omission; it constitutes an incorrect mapping of which districts are considered growth versus decline in this context. Hence the answer is not just partially correct; it is substantively incorrect relative to the ground truth definition.\n",

      "system_answer": "Trade-related concerns weighed on agriculture mainly by reducing export demand and increasing uncertainty, with effects varying by district:\n\n- **Atlanta District**: Trade policy volatility reduced agricultural exports. Overseas buyers shifted to cheaper sources, leading to:\n  - Declines in U.S. rice exports.\n  - Depressed prices and demand for export-oriented crops like soybeans, wheat, and corn as Chinese markets turned to Brazil.\n  - Domestic demand for beef, poultry, peanuts, tobacco, and dairy remained strong, partly offsetting export weakness.\n\n- **Chicago District**:  \n  - Soybean prices fell partly because there were no new-crop exports to China.\n  - Uncertainty around trade and the broader outlook unsettled farmers and damped capital investment (equipment purchases and repairs).\n\n- **San Francisco District**:  \n  - Demand from abroad, especially from China, continued to fall due to trade policy adjustments and negotiations, weakening conditions for producers dependent on export markets.\n  - The expected decline in sales volumes led some producers to curb planned investment for the next season.\n\n- **Minneapolis District** (and National Summary for Minneapolis):  \n  - Producers were “extremely concerned” about China’s decision to stop ordering U.S. soybeans.\n  - This, combined with low crop prices, weighed heavily on farm incomes despite strong harvests.\n\nAcross these districts, trade-related issues—especially reduced Chinese purchases and broader trade-policy volatility—hurt export volumes and prices for major crops (notably soybeans, but also rice, wheat, and corn), increased uncertainty, and contributed to weaker income and more cautious investment in the farm sector.",

This matches the key Minneapolis trade-related concern.\n- The system answer does not mention the St. Louis District at all, so point (2) is missing.\n- The system answer does convey a general picture consistent with point (3): it describes trade-related issues (especially reduced Chinese purchases, trade-policy volatility, reduced exports, increased uncertainty, weaker income and more cautious investment) across several districts, which aligns conceptually with “activity generally down, with trade uncertainty adding to challenges.” However, it is framed via Atlanta, Chicago, San Francisco, and Minneapolis, not in the concise cross-district summary of the expected answer.\n- There is no explicit contradiction of the ground truth, but the answer includes additional district detail (Atlanta, Chicago, San Francisco) not required by the expected answer. This added information is not flagged as wrong here because we are not given that it contradicts the context, but relative to the expected answer, the main omission is the St. Louis conditions and pessimistic outlook.\n\nBecause one major required element (St. Louis District agricultural conditions and outlook) is missing while other key elements (Minneapolis concern about Chinese soybean purchases and general trade-related drag/uncertainty) are present and accurate, the answer is incomplete but not misleading with respect to the expected answer.",

This matches the expected details for New York, including the Medicaid/health‑care angle.\n- Cleveland: System states nonprofits froze hiring and did not fill positions because of uncertainty around federal grants.

Those additions are not in conflict with the ground truth as stated. However, the answer is incomplete relative to the expected answer because it omits the Boston detail, which is a key part of the question’s scope (“across multiple districts”) and the provided ground truth.\n\nBecause two of the three core district descriptions (New York and Cleveland) are correct but the Boston component is missing, the answer is partially correct and not misleading on the parts it does cover.",

These additions are not in the expected answer and shift the emphasis away from the specifically asked “in which districts was this most prominently mentioned?”, which per the ground truth are St. Louis and Boston.\n- While the extra districts may or may not be correct given the full underlying document, relative to the expected answer they are at least partially misleading because the key district (Boston) is missing and prominence is reassigned to other districts.\n\nBecause one of the two key district facts (Boston and its specific description) is missing, the answer is incomplete, but there is no explicit factual contradiction with the expected answer as stated. This fits \"partially correct\": some key facts (sectors and St. Louis) are present, but not all (Boston and its details) and the answer is thus incomplete.\n\nTherefore the verdict is PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

Firms noted a wide range of tariff impacts on operating costs and pricing responses, as well as approaches to managing those impacts, such as absorbing cost increases, negotiating with suppliers, and passing through to customers. Contacts warned that price pass-through resulting from tariffs has just begun and expect to see prices rise into 2026. Some auto manufacturers reported feeling the pinch from tariffs on new car sales but were absorbing these increases to prevent further declines in demand. Some firms, however, reported little to no tariff impacts thus far. A few service-oriented firms noted an ability to increase prices without pushback from customers. Steel prices flattened amid slower demand, but some producers held prices steady to preserve strong margins. Internal cost pressures continued to mount, and firms noted there was little room to cut costs further. The accelerated depreciation schedule from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will help to offset cost pressures going forward according to several contacts.",

However, in the Chicago District, light vehicle sales declined overall, especially for EVs following the end of federal tax credits.

      "system_answer": "Federal policy—specifically a federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credit scheduled to expire at the end of September—directly boosted EV sales. Multiple Districts reported a “rush” or “robust surge” in EV purchases driven by consumers trying to buy before the tax credit expired.\n\nThis policy-driven spike in EV sales helped prop up overall auto sales, which otherwise were flat or declining. Some reports noted that total auto sales would have fallen more without the EV rush, and the national summary explicitly states that auto sales were “boosted” in some Districts by strong EV demand ahead of the tax credit’s expiration.",

      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the ground truth:\n1) There was a federal EV tax credit expiring at the end of September.\n2) This led to a surge in EV demand/sales before expiration, which boosted auto sales in some districts.\n3) In the Chicago District, light vehicle sales declined overall, especially EVs, after the credit ended.\n4) The overall relationship: pre-expiration demand surge followed by post-expiration decline.\n\nThe system answer correctly captures points (1) and (2): it notes a federal EV tax credit scheduled to expire at the end of September, and that it directly boosted EV sales, creating a rush/robust surge and propping up overall auto sales in some districts. That matches the ground truth about the pre-expiration boost and its support for overall auto sales.\n\nHowever, the system answer omits the Chicago District detail and the post-expiration decline in EV and light vehicle sales, which is a key part of the expected answer. It only describes the pre-expiration surge and its effect, not the subsequent drop. There is no factual contradiction, just incompleteness.\n\nTherefore the answer is accurate for the portion it covers but misses an important element, so it is partially correct rather than fully correct.",

      "expected_answer": "Wages grew at a modest to moderate pace across all districts. However, labor cost pressures intensified due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses. Additionally, some contacts in the Chicago District reported moderate increases in nonlabor costs including energy and higher prices for raw materials. This meant total compensation costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.",
      "system_answer": "Multiple factors affected labor costs, and they interacted with wage growth in several ways:\n\n1. **Employer health insurance costs**  \n   - Labor cost pressures intensified due to “outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses” [4].  \n   - In some cases, employers substantially increased their health insurance contributions alongside wage adjustments (e.g., a regional airport raised employer health insurance contributions while giving a 4% cost-of-living adjustment) [6].  \n   - Even where wage growth was only modest or moderate, rising benefit costs meant total labor costs were increasing faster than wages alone.\n\n2. **Nonlabor input costs and profitability constraints**  \n   - Firms faced robust increases in nonlabor input costs, especially from tariffs on raw materials, components, and various goods, as well as higher technology, insurance, utilities, and other operating costs [15], [18].  \n   - These rising nonlabor costs squeezed profitability, leading some manufacturers to hold wages steady despite labor market conditions [2]. Thus, higher nonlabor costs sometimes muted wage growth, as firms tried to contain overall labor costs.\n\n3. **Labor market conditions and competition for workers**  \n   - Where competition for workers remained strong—such as in banking, professional and business services, some construction and manufacturing roles, highly specialized AI positions, and some lower-wage jobs—firms raised wages to attract or retain staff [2], [5], [14].  \n   - In contrast, softening labor demand, increased labor availability, and low turnover reduced upward pressure on wages in many sectors, keeping wage growth modest and easing wage pressures overall [1], [3], [4], [7], [8], [10], [12], [19].\n\n4. **Immigration policy and labor supply constraints**  \n   - Changes and enforcement in immigration policy reduced labor supply in sectors like hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing, which strained labor markets in those areas [4], [8], [16], [19].  \n   - These localized shortages contributed to persistent wage pressures for some lower-wage and sector-specific jobs, even as wage pressures eased more broadly [5], [14].\n\n5. **Union negotiations and specific sector dynamics**  \n   - In some sectors, such as health care, recent labor union contract negotiations directly raised wages, adding to labor costs independently of broader market wage trends [5].  \n   - Some employers also implemented cost-of-living adjustments after long gaps, which increased wages and labor costs even where overall wage growth was described as moderate [6].\n\n**Interaction with wage growth:**  \n- Overall wage growth was generally modest to moderate, and in many places wage pressures were easing. However, total labor costs were pushed up by rising benefit costs (especially health insurance) and sector-specific or role-specific wage increases driven by competition, immigration-related shortages, or union settlements.  \n- At the same time, higher nonlabor input costs and weaker demand led some firms to restrain wage growth or keep wages flat to protect profitability, which tempered how far wages could rise despite these other pressures.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Wage growth was modest to moderate across districts.\n2) Labor cost pressures intensified mainly because of outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses.\n3) In the Chicago District, some contacts reported moderate increases in nonlabor costs, including energy and higher prices for raw materials.\n4) As a result, total compensation/labor costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer correctly states that overall wage growth was generally modest to moderate and that labor cost pressures intensified due to “outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses,” and explicitly notes that total labor costs were increasing faster than wages alone. This matches points 1, 2, and 4.\n- It also addresses nonlabor costs, but does so in a much broader way: tariffs on raw materials, technology, insurance, utilities, and other operating costs, and links these to wage-setting behavior. The ground truth is narrower and specific to the Chicago District (energy and raw materials). The system answer does not explicitly mention Chicago or energy, and instead generalizes to firm-wide nonlabor cost pressures and their impact on wages. This is not directly supported by the expected answer and goes beyond it.\n- The system adds several additional factors (labor market conditions, immigration policy, union negotiations, sector-specific dynamics) that are not mentioned at all in the expected answer. While these may be true in the underlying source, they are not part of the key factors the question/ground truth focuses on, and they change the emphasis from \"health insurance and some nonlabor costs caused total compensation to rise faster than wages\" to a broader causal story about wage formation. That introduces extraneous reasoning not supported by the given ground truth.\n- There are no direct factual contradictions of the ground truth, but a substantial portion of the answer discusses factors not in the expected answer and thus not required to answer the question as framed.\n\nBecause the core points about modest/moderate wage growth, health insurance cost pressures, and total compensation rising faster than wages are present and accurate, but the answer includes substantial extra causal factors beyond the expected scope, the best classification is that it captures the main facts but is not tightly aligned with the specified answer.\n\nGiven the rubric, this is closer to PARTIALLY_CORRECT: it contains all the key points but dilutes them with additional mechanisms not grounded in the expected answer, rather than being a clean, fully aligned rendition of those key facts alone.",

Many contacts across industries said that they were hiring for open positions and normal turnover. Other contacts were hiring for current or anticipated growth. For instance, one banker reported hiring loan originators in anticipation of lower mortgage rates increasing demand. Overall, retailers held staffing levels steady in recent weeks. As one restaurateur stated, \"no growth so no new positions will be added.\" Across industries, many contacts said that declining business activity led to reduced labor demand, and in some cases, to layoffs. One manufacturer said that they had postponed layoffs while waiting for industrial production to recover but could not delay cuts any longer.",

      "question": "How did consumer spending patterns affect different restaurant segments in the Chicago District?",
      "expected_answer": "In the Chicago District, leisure and hospitality sales were mixed, with softness in some travel-related categories including airlines and hotels, but increased spending at restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments. Demand from restaurant groups remained solid, as indicated by commercial real estate leasing activity.",
      "system_answer": "Consumer spending patterns in the Chicago District led to:\n\n- **Increased spending at lower- and mid-priced formats:** Fast food, fast casual, and family dining restaurants all saw **increased spending**.\n- **Relative softness in other leisure/hospitality areas:** While not broken out by restaurant type beyond those segments, overall leisure and hospitality sales were described as **mixed**, with some softness in travel-related categories (airlines and hotels), indicating consumers were more willing to spend on everyday dining out than on more expensive travel-related services.\n\nSo, restaurant segments focused on quick, convenient, and family-oriented dining benefited from the modest rise in consumer spending, while no strength was reported for higher-end or full-service restaurant segments in the Chicago District.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Leisure and hospitality sales were mixed in the Chicago District.\n2) There was softness in some travel-related categories, including airlines and hotels.\n3) There was increased spending at restaurants in fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments.\n4) Demand from restaurant groups remained solid, as reflected in commercial real estate leasing.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer correctly states that fast food, fast casual, and family dining restaurants saw increased spending (matches fact 3).\n- It correctly notes that overall leisure and hospitality sales were mixed and that there was softness in travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels (matches facts 1 and 2).\n- However, it does not mention that demand from restaurant groups remained solid as indicated by commercial real estate leasing activity (missing fact 4).\n- Additionally, it adds that \"no strength was reported for higher-end or full-service restaurant segments\"—this is not in the ground truth and is an unsupported inference. That makes part of the answer potentially incorrect/hallucinated, since the source only says nothing about those segments, not that they lacked strength.\n\nBecause of the missing leasing/demand detail and the unjustified claim about higher-end/full-service segments, the answer is not fully correct and contains unsupported information.\n",

Restaurants in the luxury and quick service categories also reported solid revenue growth. In contrast, casual sit-down restaurants reported a softening in sales. A retailer in North Carolina noted that customers were clearly looking for value and comparative price shopping in their stores. Companies tied to new home construction reported soft activity, however a replacement window company reported strong sales, which was attributed to homeowners opting to renovate rather than sell their homes. A furniture store saw less traffic and fewer sales and was concerned that recently announced tariffs would further reduce demand in the near future. Reports from tourism and travel businesses were mixed. Hotels in some parts of the Fifth District saw increased occupancy and revenues and attributed the growth to leisure and sports-related travel. Several hotels in the greater Washington, D.C. area, on the other hand, reported lower occupancy rates as business travel for conferences and worker trainings declined.",

Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months.

Tourism contacts noted a widening gap in demand between luxury and budget-friendly accommodations, where overall growth was fueled almost entirely by the former. Hotel occupancy rates for greater Boston and Cape Cod increased slightly in August from a year earlier. Retailers and restaurants across Cape Cod, coastal New Hampshire, and Maine reported that summer spending totals rose moderately from the previous year owing to an increase in the number of day trips. The number of Canadian travelers to New England remained down sharply from the previous year, and certain parts of Cape Cod and Maine experienced weaker summer tourism activity (from the previous year) as a result. Nonetheless, tourism-related spending increased modestly overall, as domestic and other international travel compensated for the decline in Canadian visitors. Auto sales in New Hampshire increased modestly from last month, driven by the rush to purchase electric vehicles before the expiration of tax credits. The outlook shifted from pessimistic to neutral among retail and tourism contacts, although contacts said that considerable uncertainty remained.",

      "question": "How did lower interest rates affect different interest rate-sensitive sectors across districts?",
      "expected_answer": "Lower interest rates had positive effects across multiple sectors: In Cleveland, commercial construction and financial services saw uptick in demand due to lower rates. In Chicago, financial conditions loosened modestly with business loan volumes increasing. However, the impact was mixed - while some reports noted improved business lending, residential real estate remained weak in Dallas and home sales were flat in Boston. The housing market's response to lower rates was more muted than commercial sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Lower interest rates had uneven effects across interest rate‑sensitive sectors and districts:\n\n- **Cleveland (Fourth District)**  \n  - **Commercial construction & commercial real estate:**  \n    - Contacts reported a *modest increase* in demand and more capital spending “as short‑term interest rates declined” [13].  \n    - National highlight for Cleveland notes an “uptick in demand because of lower interest rates” in *commercial construction and financial services* [1].  \n  - **Financial services / banking:**  \n    - Bankers said overall loan demand *increased moderately* as “both households and businesses were encouraged by lower interest rates” [8].  \n    - They expected a *sharp increase* in future loan demand driven by anticipated further rate cuts [8].\n\n- **San Francisco (Twelfth District)**  \n  - **Banking and lending:**  \n    - “Recent reductions in interest rates started to spur additional demand for loans,” though borrowers remained cautious [6].  \n    - Commercial loan demand overall stayed muted, but strengthened in specific areas (e.g., Arizona, tied to semiconductor projects) [6].  \n  - **Residential real estate:**  \n    - Activity in residential real estate *decreased somewhat* despite the lower‑rate environment [4].\n\n- **New York (Second District)**  \n  - **Residential mortgages:**  \n    - Banks reported “moderate growth in demand for residential mortgages, with strong lending volumes” [14], consistent with some support from lower rates.  \n  - **Overall loan demand / business loans:**  \n    - Overall loan demand *declined* because of weaker business loan demand, even as consumer loans and commercial mortgages were steady [14].\n\n- **Chicago (Seventh District)**  \n  - **Consumer lending (including mortgages/refinance):**  \n    - Consumer loan demand “increased slightly, with a few contacts noting a pickup in mortgage refinancing,” as loan rates “moved down” [16].  \n  - **Business lending:**  \n    - Business loan rates also moved down, but business loan demand *decreased slightly* on net [16].\n\n- **Kansas City (Tenth District)**  \n  - **Deposits / expectations around rates:**  \n    - Banks saw a modest increase in deposits (especially money market accounts and CDs) as customers tried to “lock in interest rates ahead of any market rate decreases” [7].  \n  - **CRE finance:**  \n    - Financial aspects of commercial real estate (credit standards, access to credit, loan demand) were “largely unchanged” despite weaker CRE activity [12].\n\n- **National summary (all Districts)**  \n  - **Interest rate–sensitive sectors overall:**  \n    - Conditions in financial services and sectors like residential and commercial real estate were *mixed*:  \n      - Some districts saw “improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates.”  \n      - Other districts continued to show “muted activity” in these sectors [3].\n\nIn sum, lower interest rates generally boosted loan demand in some districts (notably Cleveland and parts of San Francisco and Chicago, and for residential mortgages in New York), especially in commercial construction, real estate, and certain loan categories. However, in other districts and segments—such as business lending and some real estate markets—activity remained flat or soft, so the positive impact was uneven rather than uniform.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements of the expected answer:\n- Overall point: lower interest rates had generally positive but mixed effects across interest‑rate‑sensitive sectors.\n- Cleveland: uptick in demand in commercial construction and financial services due to lower rates.\n- Chicago: financial conditions loosened modestly; business loan volumes increasing.\n- Mixed impact on housing: residential real estate remained weak in Dallas and home sales flat in Boston; housing response more muted than commercial sectors.\n\nCheck against system answer:\n- Overall theme: System clearly states effects were uneven/mixed and notes that some districts saw improved business lending while others had muted activity. This matches the ground truth’s overall characterization.\n- Cleveland: System explicitly mentions “uptick in demand because of lower interest rates” in commercial construction and financial services and increased loan demand. This directly matches the expected Cleveland content.\n- Chicago: System says consumer loan demand increased slightly with lower rates, but “business loan demand decreased slightly on net.” The ground truth says in Chicago financial conditions loosened modestly with business loan volumes increasing. This is a direct contradiction on the direction of business loan demand.\n- Housing / residential real estate: Ground truth highlights Dallas and Boston with weak/flat housing and that housing’s response was more muted than commercial. The system instead talks about San Francisco’s residential real estate decreasing, New York residential mortgages growing, and does not mention Dallas or Boston at all. While it still conveys that real estate reactions were mixed, it does not reproduce the specific districts and patterns in the expected answer.\n- The system also adds several other districts (San Francisco, New York, Kansas City) and details that are not in the expected answer. Extra detail is fine as long as it’s not wrong, but here we have at least one clear contradiction (Chicago business loan demand).\n\nBecause of the direct contradiction about Chicago business loan volumes/demand, the answer cannot be considered correct or merely incomplete; it is factually inconsistent with the expected answer. Thus it is INCORRECT under the rubric.",

Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong.

Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts.

The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months.

In Cleveland, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to federal grant uncertainty. In New York, nonprofits faced challenges from reduced federal benefit programs, with community health-care centers reporting financial strain. Manufacturing employment in Boston was mixed, with one firm shedding workers to offset tariff-related cost increases.",
      "system_answer": "Cuts and uncertainty in federal funding led to employment declines or hiring freezes in specific areas:\n\n- **Education and health care:** In the Boston District, “cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health-care sectors” [5].  \n- **Nonprofits:** Multiple nonprofit contacts reported reduced or uncertain federal grants, which caused some organizations not to fill open positions [1] and forced others to plan for smaller budgets and prioritize services [7], implying constrained hiring.  \n- **Construction (indirectly):** In the Philadelphia District, “uncertainty surrounding the status of federal funding continued to slow previously planned projects” in nonresidential construction [19], which would dampen construction employment tied to those projects.",

This aligns with the Cleveland nonprofit effect, though it doesn’t name Cleveland; however, that’s acceptable as long as the mechanism and sectoral effect are right.\n- Does NOT mention (3): no reference to New York, reduced federal benefit programs, or community health centers’ financial strain.\n- Does NOT mention (4): no reference to Boston manufacturing or tariff-related worker shedding.\n- Adds a construction example (Philadelphia nonresidential construction slowed by federal funding uncertainty), which is not in the expected answer but is not necessarily wrong or contradictory; it’s just extra.\n\nThere are no clear factual contradictions with the ground truth, but the answer is incomplete because it omits the New York nonprofit/health-center impacts and the Boston manufacturing employment effect.

      "expected_answer": "Multiple factors contributed to uncertainty: Tariff policy changes made planning difficult for manufacturers (noted in Chicago and across districts). Federal grant uncertainty affected nonprofits (Cleveland, New York, Boston). Policy uncertainty was a top business concern (Dallas). Immigration policy changes created labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston). The potential for government shutdown was highlighted as a downside risk. Kansas City noted that despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic.",
      "system_answer": "Several specific factors in the context contributed to economic uncertainty across different districts:\n\n1. **Boston (First District – Community Perspectives) [1]**\n   - Increased economic precarity among low- and moderate-income households (greater food pantry use; more difficulty paying rent, utilities, and bills).\n   - Households drawing down savings to cover basic needs.\n   - Planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid.\n   - Further increases in consumer prices linked to tariffs.\n   - Workforce housing shortages and rising construction costs limiting new affordable housing.\n\n2. **Chicago (Community Conditions) [8]**\n   - Employers becoming more “selective” in hiring and less eager to fill positions, increasing uncertainty for jobseekers facing barriers to employment.\n   - Nonprofits anticipating smaller budgets and needing new funding streams for 2026.\n   - Social service providers facing higher operating costs (e.g., insurance) alongside reduced income and donations, forcing difficult service-prioritization decisions.\n\n3. **San Francisco (Community Conditions) [12]**\n   - Weakened conditions for community support organizations and small businesses, with rising demand for assistance but cuts to funding and grants.\n   - Small businesses experiencing lower demand, strained finances, and needing to draw down savings and cut investment.\n   - Changes in customer behavior tied to immigration policy, reducing demand.\n   - Increased business closures, reduced operating hours, and some rise in loan delinquencies.\n\n4. **Atlanta (Labor Markets and Construction/Real Estate) [13], [14]**\n   - A “hiring chill,” low turnover, and more frequent headcount reductions, with expectations of further cuts tied in part to generative AI and potential demand slowdowns.\n   - Uncertainty about both labor supply and consumer demand weighing on hiring plans.\n   - Homebuyers’ increased hesitation to purchase due to economic uncertainty.\n   - Deteriorating credit profiles of potential buyers making mortgage qualification harder.\n\n5. **St. Louis (Consumer Spending) [18]**\n   - Slight decline in consumer spending and anxiety among businesses about the upcoming holiday season.\n   - Middle-income consumers becoming more cautious and increasingly reliant on credit, “buy now, pay later,” and facing elevated credit card delinquencies.\n   - Rising food pantry usage among low- and middle-income households.\n   - Weaker travel and event-related demand described as a “middle-class recession” affecting certain hospitality segments.\n\n6. **Minneapolis (National Summary and Consumer Spending) [19], [20]**\n   - Slight contraction in overall district activity and softer labor demand.\n   - Rising input price pressures despite modest overall price increases.\n   - Concern over China’s elimination of soybean purchases in agriculture.\n   - Lower retail, hospitality, and tourism revenue and profits, with expectations of continued weakness and margin pressure.\n   - Businesses noting higher labor and expense costs alongside flat or declining revenue.\n   - Reported “economic uncertainties” creating caution among consumers and leading to curtailed vacation and discretionary spending.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key elements in the expected answer:\n- Tariff policy changes made planning difficult for manufacturers (Chicago and broadly)\n- Federal grant uncertainty affected nonprofits (Cleveland, New York, Boston)\n- Policy uncertainty cited as a top business concern (Dallas)\n- Immigration policy changes created labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston)\n- Potential government shutdown noted as a downside risk\n- Kansas City noted that despite current decline, expectations for 2026 remained optimistic\n\nThe system answer instead:\n- Lists many factors like economic precarity, SNAP/Medicaid cuts, housing shortages, hiring chill, consumer caution, etc.\n- Mentions tariffs only in the context of “further increases in consumer prices linked to tariffs,” not “tariff policy changes making planning difficult for manufacturers (Chicago and across districts).”\n- Talks about nonprofits anticipating smaller budgets and needing new funding streams, and cuts to funding and grants, but does not tie this to **federal grant uncertainty in Cleveland, New York, and Boston** as specified in the ground truth.\n- Does not mention Dallas or that policy uncertainty was a top business concern there.\n- Mentions “changes in customer behavior tied to immigration policy, reducing demand” (San Francisco) but does **not** mention immigration policy as creating **labor supply** concerns in St. Louis and Boston.\n- Does not mention the potential for a government shutdown as a risk.\n- Does not mention Kansas City or the point that despite current decline, 2026 expectations were optimistic.\n\nSo, the system answer is largely about different uncertainties but it does not capture most of the specific factors and districts required by the expected answer, and it adds many other details that aren’t in the ground truth. There is no explicit contradiction of the ground truth, but the key required items are mostly missing. The included points are not clearly wrong, but the answer fails to address the main specified factors. This makes it incomplete rather than factually incorrect.\n\nTherefore the best classification is PARTIALLY_CORRECT: it discusses economic uncertainties but misses most of the specific factors and district associations in the expected answer.",

      "question": "What service-related costs contributed to input cost increases, and how did this affect different sectors?",
      "expected_answer": "Several service-related costs drove input cost increases: insurance, health care, and technology solutions all saw higher costs. In New York, rising business costs including insurance added to financial pressures for community service providers. Employer-sponsored health insurance expenses saw outsized increases, intensifying labor cost pressures across districts. These service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.",
      "system_answer": "Service-related costs contributing to input cost increases included:\n\n- **Insurance premiums** – especially liability and trucking insurance, as well as general business insurance.  \n  - Affected sectors: professional and business services, transportation and logistics firms, restaurants and other service firms, and a broad set of businesses citing higher insurance as a key cost pressure.\n\n- **Health care costs** – notably rising employee health-care premiums.  \n  - Affected sectors: many service firms and other employers generally, including firms in the Philadelphia and Minneapolis districts that reported nearly 10 percent increases in health-care costs and significant premium hikes.\n\n- **Technology / IT services / technology solutions** – higher costs for technology systems and IT services.  \n  - Affected sectors: banking, professional and business services, and other firms using technology solutions, with IT service prices reported rising moderately.\n\nThese rising service-related input costs (insurance, health care, technology/IT) increased overall cost pressures for service sector firms (professional services, logistics, hospitals, and other nonfinancial services) as well as firms in goods-producing sectors (manufacturing, retail) that must purchase these services, compressing margins and in some cases prompting price increases or other cost-containment measures.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Service-related costs that drove input cost increases were insurance, health care, and technology solutions.\n2) In New York, rising business costs including insurance added financial pressures for community service providers.\n3) Employer-sponsored health insurance expenses saw outsized increases, intensifying labor cost pressures across districts.\n4) These service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.\n\nComparison with system answer:\n1) The system correctly identifies the same three service-related categories: insurance, health care, and technology/IT services. This matches the core of the ground truth.\n2) The system elaborates on affected sectors (professional/business services, transportation/logistics, restaurants, banking, manufacturing, retail), which is consistent with the idea that these costs affect various sectors; there is no contradiction, just more detail.\n3) It captures that rising health-care costs affected employers broadly and intensified cost pressures, in line with “employer-sponsored health insurance expenses saw outsized increases, intensifying labor cost pressures across districts,” though it doesn’t use the exact phrasing but conveys the same idea.\n4) It notes that these rising service-related input costs increased overall cost pressures and compressed margins, which is consistent with the expected impact description.\n5) The only element it omits is the explicit mention that these service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases, and it does not specifically mention New York community service providers. However, the question is about which service-related costs and how they affected different sectors; the system answer directly addresses that. The omitted tariff detail is extra context, not essential to answering the user’s question.\n6) There are no apparent factual errors or contradictions relative to the expected answer.\n\nGiven that all key service-related cost categories and their sectoral impacts are correctly covered, and no wrong information is added, the answer is complete and accurate for the posed question, even though it doesn’t restate every contextual nuance from the ground truth.\n\nVerdict: correct",

Categories seeing gains included restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments, as well as new light vehicle sales which were brisk due to strong underlying demand and the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases. Categories seeing softness included travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels. Used vehicle sales remained steady though dealerships in low-to-moderate income communities reported softer demand. This pattern reflects consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.",
      "system_answer": "Across the reports, gains tended to occur in higher-end, value-differentiated, or necessity-oriented categories, while more price-sensitive and discretionary categories generally declined. Specifically:\n\n**Categories seeing gains or relative strength:**\n- **Luxury and higher-end retail and services**\n  - Luxury goods and athletic footwear performed well (San Francisco [3]).\n  - Small higher-end retailers and luxury restaurants reported solid growth (Richmond [6]).\n  - Luxury travel and accommodations outperformed budget options (Philadelphia tourism [19]; Boston tourism [17]; St. Louis notes continued upper‑income travel and luxury services [12]).\n- **Health-related and necessity categories**\n  - Health care and food & beverage retailers saw flat to slight increases (Dallas [2]).\n  - Demand grew for health-related food services (San Francisco services [11]).\n- **Some technology and durable goods pockets**\n  - Strong spending on appliances and computers (Chicago [4]).\n  - Business technology services demand grew (Boston summary [15]; San Francisco services [11]).\n- **Quick-service / value-focused dining**\n  - Quick service and some fast casual/fast food restaurants saw increased or solid spending (Chicago [4]; Richmond [6]; San Francisco services [11]).\n- **Electric and used vehicles**\n  - New EV sales were strong ahead of tax credit expirations (Chicago [4]; Atlanta [5]; Boston tourism/retail via NH auto [17]).\n  - Used car sales were a relative bright spot where mentioned (Cleveland [8]; Kansas City shift toward used [7]).\n\n**Categories seeing declines or softness:**\n- **General retail and many goods categories**\n  - Overall retail sales declined or softened in multiple districts (Philadelphia [1]; Dallas [2]; San Francisco retail [3]; Atlanta [5]; Kansas City [7]; Cleveland [8]; Minneapolis [10]).\n  - Specific declines in building materials, garden equipment, furniture, electronics/appliances (Dallas [2]; Chicago building materials and some electronics [4]; Richmond furniture [6]).\n  - Demand weakened for more affordable goods vs. luxury options (San Francisco [3]).\n- **Travel, hospitality, and tourism (non-luxury)**\n  - Broad tourism and travel softness: lower hotel occupancy, curtailed vacation spending, weaker fall bookings (Philadelphia tourism [19]; Minneapolis [10]; Cleveland tourism [8]; St. Louis hotels & events [12]; San Francisco services [11]).\n  - Declines especially among middle-class and select‑service/budget hotels (St. Louis [12]).\n- **Mid-range / full-service restaurants**\n  - Casual sit-down and full-service restaurants reported softer sales, with some closures (Richmond [6]; San Francisco services [11]; Atlanta diners skipping desserts/alcohol [5]).\n- **Autos and certain big-ticket goods**\n  - Auto sales generally weak or flat in several regions, aside from EV timing effects and used vehicles (Dallas [2]; Atlanta [5] for non‑EVs; Cleveland [8]; Kansas City [7] with declines in automotive goods).\n  - Shifts away from SUVs and EVs toward sedans and used cars (Kansas City [7]).\n\n**What this reflects about consumer behavior:**\n- **Increased price sensitivity and “trading down” for the middle and lower income consumer.**\n  - Multiple districts highlight consumers “looking for value,” hunting for deals, and stretching dollars (Richmond [6]; Kansas City [7]; Minneapolis [10]; Cleveland [8]).\n  - Middle-income households are cautious and reliant on credit, BNPL, and food pantries (St. Louis [12]).\n\n- **Bifurcation by income:**\n  - Mid‑ to upper‑income and luxury segments remain relatively strong in apparel, cosmetics, luxury goods, and high‑end travel/restaurant spending (New York [9]; San Francisco [3]; Boston tourism [17]; St. Louis [12]; Philadelphia tourism [19]).\n  - Middle-income and lower-income consumers are cutting back on discretionary travel, full‑service dining, and big-ticket goods.\n\n- **Selective spending and timing behavior:**\n  - Consumers still spend on perceived essentials or high‑value items (health, certain tech, quick-service dining) and respond strongly to discounts and tax incentives (EV rush, deal-driven surges in Kansas City [7], Chicago [4], Boston [17]).\n  - There is some substitution from owning new big-ticket goods (new cars, furniture, home moves) toward cost-saving alternatives (used vehicles; home renovation instead of moving in Richmond [6]).\n\nOverall, the pattern is one of cautious, value-driven spending by much of the population, with continued robust demand at the top end of the market and in some necessity and value-oriented categories, and broad softness in discretionary, mid-priced goods and travel.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts from the expected answer:\n1) Location/scope is Chicago specifically.\n2) Gains: leisure and hospitality sales mixed, but restaurants in fast food, fast casual, and family dining saw gains.\n3) Gains: new light vehicle sales were brisk, driven by strong demand and end of EV tax incentives.\n4) Softness: travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels.\n5) Used vehicle sales remained steady, with softer demand in low‑ to moderate‑income communities.\n6) Interpretation: consumers are seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer is not focused on Chicago at all; it generalizes \"across the reports\" and discusses many other districts and categories.\n- It does mention quick service / fast casual / fast food restaurants seeing increased spending, which aligns partially with the restaurant gains, but it adds a lot of unrelated detail and shifts the framing.\n- It incorrectly characterizes new vehicle trends relative to the ground truth: it says \"New EV sales were strong ahead of tax credit expirations\" and presents autos as generally weak, whereas the ground truth for Chicago is that new light vehicle sales overall were brisk due to strong underlying demand and the end of EV tax incentives. The emphasis and specifics do not match, and the broader treatment of autos conflicts with the described Chicago pattern.\n- It states that used car sales were a relative bright spot, which conflicts with the more nuanced Chicago description (used sales steady overall with softness in low‑ to moderate‑income communities).\n- It does identify travel, hospitality, and tourism softness, which is directionally similar to the airline/hotel softness, but it wraps this in a much broader narrative, including luxury travel doing well, not present in the expected answer.\n- The behavioral interpretation is broader and partially aligned (value‑seeking, cutting back on discretionary travel and full‑service dining), but introduces substantial extra claims not grounded in the Chicago passage, including strong luxury and high‑end demand, health categories, technology, and detailed bifurcation by income that go beyond or diverge from the expected explanation.\n\nBecause the system answer is not scoped to Chicago, introduces many extraneous claims, and contains statements that conflict with the expected description of vehicle and used vehicle trends, it cannot be considered correct or merely incomplete. It is not an abstention. It is therefore incorrect relative to the expected answer.\n",

Retailers and restaurants across Cape Cod, coastal New Hampshire, and Maine reported that summer spending totals rose moderately from the previous year owing to an increase in the number of day trips. The number of Canadian travelers to New England remained down sharply from the previous year, and certain parts of Cape Cod and Maine experienced weaker summer tourism activity (from the previous year) as a result. Nonetheless, tourism-related spending increased modestly overall, as domestic and other international travel compensated for the decline in Canadian visitors.

This matches and expands on point 2.\n- For Dallas, it says “drilling activity and oil production were flat,” capturing the flat drilling idea but omitting the specific mention of well completion activity; however, what is stated is not contradictory. This partially aligns with point 3.\n- It does not explicitly synthesize that, nationally, energy activity was generally down among reporting districts. It lists several district-level details (e.g., KC, Minneapolis, SF) that imply weakness but never states the national pattern as such, so point 4 is not clearly captured as in the expected answer.\n- It omits the Chicago District note about higher energy prices affecting manufacturers (point 5).\n- It adds details about Kansas City, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and New York that are not in the expected answer but are not contradictory.\n\nThere are no clear factual errors or contradictions relative to the expected answer; the answer is more detailed but misses some key expected elements (national summary, specific Chicago reference, explicit well completion mention). Hence it is accurate where it speaks, but incomplete relative to the expected answer.",

      "question": "How did banking conditions differ for consumer versus business lending across districts?",
      "expected_answer": "In Kansas City, while expectations for 2026 were optimistic, consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately, signaling stress among households. In Chicago, business loan demand decreased slightly on net with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity, while consumer loan demand increased slightly with a pickup in mortgage refinancing. In Dallas, loan demand grew overall. St. Louis reported banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions. Consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.",
      "system_answer": "Banking conditions showed a consistent pattern across districts: business lending was generally steadier or stronger than consumer lending, while consumer credit quality deteriorated more.\n\nBy district:\n\n- **St. Louis:**  \n  - Business: Strong commercial loan demand; one banker “bullish” due to falling rates, though small-business demand had been depressed but was rebuilding.  \n  - Consumer: Delinquency rates “steadily increasing” and expected to keep rising; some borrowers turning to credit counseling.\n\n- **Kansas City:**  \n  - Business: Loan demand and credit standards largely unchanged across categories.  \n  - Consumer: “Moderate deterioration” in consumer lending portfolios, with expectations of further challenges as disposable incomes fall.\n\n- **Atlanta:**  \n  - Business: Corporate loan demand muted but not singled out as deteriorating in quality.  \n  - Consumer: Overall consumer lending contracted further; delinquencies ticked up.\n\n- **New York:**  \n  - Business: Sagging demand for business loans led to an overall decline in loan demand; delinquencies worsened “especially for business loans.”  \n  - Consumer: Demand for consumer loans held steady; residential mortgage demand grew moderately with strong volumes.\n\n- **Philadelphia:**  \n  - Business: Commercial and industrial lending showed a “continued strong decline”; commercial real estate loans declined modestly.  \n  - Consumer: Most consumer segments grew—consumer lending rose strongly (ex-auto/credit cards); HELOCs, auto loans, and mortgages all increased at varying paces; only credit card volumes declined modestly.\n\n- **Richmond:**  \n  - Business: Demand for most loan types stable, with some modest increase in commercial loan demand.  \n  - Consumer: Slight rise in delinquencies “mainly within their consumer loan portfolios,” including mortgages and HELOCs.\n\n- **Dallas:**  \n  - Business: Loan demand up overall; credit standards tightened for most non-residential types; commercial real estate loan performance improved sharply.  \n  - Consumer: Credit standards continued tightening for all loan types except residential real estate; overall loan performance deteriorated slightly.\n\n- **San Francisco:**  \n  - Business: Commercial loan demand generally muted, with localized strength (e.g., semiconductor projects in Arizona).  \n  - Consumer: Overall lending steady; no specific sign of broad consumer stress, though one contact reported increased fraud-related losses (not clearly split by loan type).\n\nOverall, across districts:\n- **Business lending**: Frequently described as flat to muted, with some areas of strength (commercial loans in St. Louis, Richmond; residential/commercial real estate or corporate demand in some areas). Quality issues were more localized (notably NY business delinquencies).\n- **Consumer lending**: Often weaker or under more stress—falling or flat demand in several districts and more consistent reports of rising delinquencies and portfolio deterioration (St. Louis, Kansas City, Atlanta, Richmond, Dallas), though Philadelphia was an exception with notably strong consumer loan growth.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Kansas City: consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately despite optimistic expectations for 2026, indicating household stress.\n2) Chicago: business loan demand decreased slightly on net, with a cited decline in acquisition activity; consumer loan demand increased slightly with more mortgage refinancing.\n3) Dallas: loan demand grew overall.\n4) St. Louis: banking activity unchanged, overall credit conditions strong; consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.\n\nComparison:\n- The system answer is organized by many districts, but it does NOT mention Chicago at all, so it misses the specific and central contrast in Chicago between declining business loan demand and slightly rising consumer loan demand with mortgage refinancing.\n- For Kansas City, it aligns with the expected answer on consumer conditions: it notes “moderate deterioration” in consumer lending portfolios and expectations of further challenges, which matches the ground truth about moderate deterioration and household stress. It also states “loan demand and credit standards largely unchanged across categories” for business, which does not contradict the ground truth (which only comments on expectations for 2026 and consumer deterioration, not on business lending conditions). So Kansas City is effectively consistent, though it adds neutral business information not in the ground truth.\n- For Dallas, the expected answer simply says “loan demand grew overall.” The system answer says: “Business: Loan demand up overall; … Consumer: … overall loan performance deteriorated slightly.” This is consistent with the idea that loan demand grew overall; it adds nuance about tightening standards and slight deterioration in performance but doesn’t contradict the ground truth.\n- For St. Louis, the expected answer: banking activity unchanged, strong overall credit conditions, consumer lending shows some stress, business lending mixed. The system answer: business – strong commercial loan demand, bullish; consumer – delinquency rates steadily increasing, some borrowers in credit counseling. That is directionally consistent with “strong overall credit conditions” plus “consumer stress,” although it characterizes business as stronger rather than “mixed.” However, “mixed” vs “strong commercial loan demand” are not directly contradictory, just more specific and somewhat more positive; there’s no explicit factual conflict given the limited detail in the ground truth.\n- The system answer includes many other districts (Atlanta, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, San Francisco) that are not mentioned in the expected answer. Those added details may or may not match the source document, but for this task we only judge relative to the expected answer. Their presence is not penalized as long as they are not contradicting the key facts, and they don’t.\n\nMain issue: the user question is about how banking conditions differed for consumer vs business lending across districts, and the expected answer appears scoped to only four districts (Kansas City, Chicago, Dallas, St. Louis). The system answer omits Chicago entirely and therefore misses a key contrast between business and consumer lending conditions in that district. This makes the answer incomplete relative to the ground truth. However, what it does say about Kansas City, Dallas, and St. Louis is broadly consistent with the ground truth and not factually wrong.\n\nThus, the answer contains some correct key facts but omits an important one and is incomplete, without introducing clear contradictions to the expected answer. That fits “PARTIALLY_CORRECT.”",

In Richmond, price growth remained moderate overall despite some pickup in price growth in the manufacturing sector. In Chicago, producer prices grew moderately with contacts reporting moderate nonlabor cost increases including energy and raw materials. Manufacturing contacts attributed some raw materials price increases to tariffs, suggesting tariffs disproportionately affected goods-producing sectors.",
      "system_answer": "Across the reports, price pressures were generally higher and more upward‑moving in manufacturing than in services:\n\n- Richmond: Service firms reported “virtually no change in price growth,” while manufacturers saw “a slight increase in prices received.”\n- Kansas City: Input prices grew “at a strong pace” for manufacturing but only “more moderately” for services. Manufacturers expected selling price growth to accelerate to a strong pace; services anticipated only moderate price growth.\n- Dallas: Selling prices rose “more sharply in the manufacturing sector,” while “price pressures were subdued in services.”\n- National Summary (Dallas highlight): “Price pressures were subdued in services but remained elevated in the manufacturing sector.”\n\nOverall, manufacturing faced stronger and more accelerating price pressures, while services experienced more moderate or subdued price growth.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) Dallas: price pressures were subdued in services but remained elevated in manufacturing.\n2) Richmond: price growth remained moderate overall despite some pickup in price growth in manufacturing.\n3) Chicago: producer prices grew moderately with moderate nonlabor cost increases (energy, raw materials); manufacturing contacts tied some raw materials price increases to tariffs, implying tariffs disproportionately affected goods‑producing sectors.\n\nCheck against system answer:\n- Dallas: The system states “Price pressures were subdued in services but remained elevated in the manufacturing sector,” and also that selling prices rose more sharply in manufacturing while subdued in services. This matches and elaborates correctly.\n- Richmond: The system says service firms reported virtually no change in price growth, while manufacturers saw a slight increase in prices received. This is consistent with the idea that overall price growth was moderate and manufacturing saw some pickup, so Richmond is covered without contradiction.\n- Chicago: The system answer does not mention Chicago at all, so it omits the information on moderate producer price growth, moderate nonlabor cost increases (energy, raw materials), and the role of tariffs disproportionately affecting goods‑producing sectors.\n- The system introduces Kansas City and a “National Summary” highlight, which are not in the ground truth but are not stated to be false; however, they are extraneous relative to the asked comparison and do not conflict with the expected answer.\n\nBecause the Chicago component (including the tariff‑related distinction for goods‑producing sectors) is entirely missing, the answer does not contain all key facts. The included facts are accurate and non‑contradictory, but the answer is incomplete.\n\nThus, the appropriate verdict is PARTIALLY_CORRECT.",

Firms noted a wide range of tariff impacts on operating costs and pricing responses, as well as approaches to managing those impacts, such as absorbing cost increases, negotiating with suppliers, and passing through to customers. Contacts warned that price pass-through resulting from tariffs has just begun and expect to see prices rise into 2026. Some auto manufacturers reported feeling the pinch from tariffs on new car sales but were absorbing these increases to prevent further declines in demand. Some firms, however, reported little to no tariff impacts thus far. A few service-oriented firms noted an ability to increase prices without pushback from customers. Steel prices flattened amid slower demand, but some producers held prices steady to preserve strong margins. Internal cost pressures continued to mount, and firms noted there was little room to cut costs further. The accelerated depreciation schedule from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will help to offset cost pressures going forward according to several contacts.",

      "expected_answer": "Employers showed cautious hiring behavior: More employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. Those still hiring favored temporary and part-time workers over full-time employment. In Boston, both hiring and layoffs increased modestly, indicating churn rather than net growth. Employment in IT services increased modestly with hiring in sales and technical positions - a relative bright spot. Jobseekers in Cleveland reported offers were more likely to be part-time with little or no benefits. This pattern indicates employer uncertainty and reluctance to commit to permanent workforce expansion.",
      "system_answer": "Hiring shifted from broad expansion to more cautious, replacement-focused, and often temporary hiring, with some outright reductions:\n\n- Many firms are now hiring mainly to replace turnover rather than to support growth (San Francisco, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, National Summary).\n- Several districts report “hiring chills,” slower or postponed hiring, and greater use of temp or project-based roles instead of permanent staff (Atlanta, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, National Summary).\n- Some firms are trimming head counts or planning modest layoffs, often tied to weaker demand, economic uncertainty, or adoption of AI (Dallas, Kansas City, Boston, National Summary).\n- Where hiring does occur, employers generally find it easier to fill roles and have plentiful applicants, and turnover is very low.\n\nThese patterns indicate employers’ confidence is subdued: businesses are cautious about future demand, reluctant to commit to permanent expansion of staff, and focused on right-sizing and efficiency rather than aggressive growth.",

However, it omits several specific regional details (Boston churn, IT services bright spot, Cleveland part-time offers) that are part of the expected answer. So it is accurate but incomplete.",

      "expected_answer": "Chicago District indicators: Economic activity was little changed (matching national 'little change on balance'). Consumer spending increased modestly (better than national 'inched down'). Manufacturing demand declined modestly (consistent with national challenging conditions). Employment was flat (matching national stable levels). Wages and benefits costs were up modestly (matching national modest-to-moderate). Prices rose moderately (matching national rising trend). Financial conditions loosened slightly (better than mixed national picture). Construction/real estate increased slightly (better than mixed national). Farm income prospects unchanged. Compared to national trends, Chicago showed relative strength in financial conditions, construction, and consumer spending while manufacturing weakness aligned with broader trends.",
      "system_answer": "For the Chicago (Seventh) District, the key economic indicators mentioned were:\n\n- **Overall economic activity:** Flat / little changed.  \n- **Consumer spending:** Increased modestly.  \n- **Construction and real estate activity:** Increased slightly.  \n- **Employment:** Flat.  \n- **Nonbusiness (community/nonprofit) activity:** No change.  \n- **Business (capital) spending:** Declined slightly.  \n- **Manufacturing activity:** Declined modestly.  \n- **Prices:** Rose moderately.  \n- **Wages:** Up modestly.  \n- **Financial conditions:** Loosened slightly.  \n- **Agriculture (prospects for 2025 farm income):** Unchanged.\n\n**Comparison to national trends (based on the National Summary snippet provided):**\n\n- The context only gives national-style highlight text for individual districts (including Chicago) but does not provide an explicit, unified national-average description for all indicators.  \n- Therefore, I cannot definitively compare each Chicago indicator to a stated national trend within the provided material.\n\nI cannot find more specific information about how these Seventh District indicators compare to overall national trends in the provided context.",
      "verdict": "partially",
      "judge_reasoning": "Key facts in the expected answer:\n1) List of Chicago District indicators: little-changed economic activity; modestly higher consumer spending; modestly lower manufacturing demand; flat employment; modest wage/benefit increases; moderate price increases; slightly loosened financial conditions; slightly higher construction/real estate; unchanged farm income prospects.\n2) Explicit comparison to national trends: \n   - Overall activity: Chicago ‘little changed’ matches national ‘little change on balance’.\n   - Consumer spending: Chicago up modestly vs national ‘inched down’ (relatively stronger).\n   - Manufacturing: Chicago modest decline aligns with national “challenging conditions”.\n   - Employment: flat, matching national stable.\n   - Wages: modest, matching national modest-to-moderate.\n   - Prices: rose moderately, matching national rising trend.\n   - Financial conditions: loosened slightly, relatively stronger than mixed national picture.\n   - Construction/real estate: increased slightly, stronger than mixed national.\n   - Farm income: unchanged (no explicit national comparison but stated as such).\n\nSystem answer:\n- It correctly lists essentially all the Chicago indicators, matching the expected facts: activity little changed, consumer spending up modestly, construction/real estate up slightly, employment flat, manufacturing down modestly, prices up moderately, wages up modestly, financial conditions loosened slightly, farm income prospects unchanged. It also adds community/nonprofit and capital spending, which are not in the ground truth but are not wrong or contradictory.\n- On comparison to national trends, however, it explicitly says it cannot definitively compare each Chicago indicator to national trends and that it cannot find more specific information on that comparison. This directly omits the second major part of the expected answer, which is a detailed comparison dimension-by-dimension, including the point that Chicago shows relative strength in financial conditions, construction, and consumer spending while manufacturing weakness matches broader trends.\n- There is no factual error; the omission is that it abstains on the comparison rather than providing it, but it does not say anything incorrect about that comparison.\n\nGiven that: the system answer is complete and correct for the Chicago indicators themselves, but it fails to provide the required comparative analysis to national trends. The present content is accurate and non-contradictory but incomplete relative to the full expected answer. That fits \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\" rather than \"ABSTAINED\" (because it does answer much of the question) or \"INCORRECT\" (no wrong facts).",
