      "question": "What was the outlook for future economic growth?",
      "expected": "The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity.",
      "predicted": "The outlook for future economic growth was **generally modest and mixed across Federal Reserve Districts, with weak\u2011to\u2011moderate expected growth rather than strong or accelerating growth.**\n\n**Time horizon and general characterization**  \nAcross the October 15, 2025 Beige Book, contacts typically discussed the outlook over the **next six months** or \u201cin the months ahead,\u201d and in some cases \u201cnext year,\u201d depending on District and sector. [Sub\u2011Query 1]\n\n**Districts expecting modest or cautiously positive growth**\n- **Philadelphia (Third District):**\n  - Firms \u201cexpect a **modest increase in economic activity over the next six months**\u201d and \u201cgenerally expect **modest growth** over the next six months, despite heightened economic uncertainty.\u201d [Sub\u2011Query 1]\n  - **Manufacturing** contacts were more upbeat: they \u201cremained optimistic about growth over the next six months,\u201d with **more than half expecting increases in new orders and shipments**, indicating modest to moderate expansion in that sector. [Sub\u2011Query 1]\n- **Cleveland (Fourth District):**\n  - Contacts \u201cexpected overall business activity in the district to **increase modestly in the months ahead**.\u201d [Sub\u2011Query 1]\n- **Dallas \u2013 Financial services:**\n  - Survey respondents \u201cexpect **increasing business activity six months from now**,\u201d pointing to modest improvement. [Sub\u2011Query 1]\n- **Kansas City \u2013 Manufacturing:**\n  - Manufacturing contacts \u201cexpect economic conditions **next year to be more favorable**,\u201d with **most firms expecting higher sales and employment by end\u20112026 than 2025**, implying gradual strengthening beyond the near term. [Sub\u2011Query 2]\n- **Boston:**\n  - The regional outlook is described as **neutral to cautiously optimistic**, consistent with weak\u2011to\u2011moderate, not robust, expected growth. [Sub\u2011Query 2]\n\n**Districts with weaker or more cautious outlooks**\n- **New York:**\n  - \u201cBusinesses \u2026 did **not expect activity to increase much in the months ahead**,\u201d indicating a subdued, near\u2011flat growth outlook. [Sub\u2011Query 1]\n- **Chicago:**\n  - \u201cExpectations for the coming year \u2026 **decreased**,\u201d suggesting growing concern and softer expected growth. [Sub\u2011Query 2]\n- **St. Louis:**\n  - The outlook \u201cremains **slightly pessimistic**,\u201d implying expectations of very weak or possibly declining activity. [Sub\u2011Query 2]\n- **Twelfth District (San Francisco):**\n  - The District\u2019s outlook \u201c**weakened somewhat**,\u201d pointing to slower expected growth ahead. [Sub\u2011Query 2]\n\n**Overall pattern for future economic growth**\n- Across Districts, the **expected pace of future growth is weak\u2011to\u2011moderate and not clearly accelerating**. [Sub\u2011Query 2]\n- Several Districts (Philadelphia, Cleveland, Dallas financial services, Kansas City manufacturing) foresee **modest increases** in activity, typically over the next six months or the coming year. [Sub\u2011Query 1; Sub\u2011Query 2]\n- Other Districts (New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Twelfth) report **subdued, weakening, or slightly pessimistic** expectations. [Sub\u2011Query 1; Sub\u2011Query 2]\n- Taken together, the Beige Book depicts a **varied national outlook**, ranging from **neutral to cautiously optimistic in some regions to slightly pessimistic in others**, with **no indication of strong or broad\u2011based acceleration** in growth.

[BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland, Summary of Economic Activity; Labor Markets]\n- In the excerpts provided, the Cleveland report\u2019s sectoral detail (e.g., commercial construction, financial services, professional and business services) **never specifically references nonprofits** or nonprofit organizations, and there are **no data or narrative statements about nonprofit headcounts, layoffs, or hiring freezes**. [BeigeBook_20251015, Cleveland, Summary of Economic Activity; Nonfinancial Services; Community Conditions]\n\nOther districts\u2019 Beige Book entries (e.g., Chicago and San Francisco) describe nonprofits facing funding cuts or uncertainty and constrained staffing, but those comments **do not apply to Cleveland**. In particular, the evidence packet shows that:\n- References to nonprofits anticipating smaller budgets belong to the **Chicago** District, and\n- References to funding and grant cuts limiting community organizations\u2019 capacity belong to the **San Francisco (Twelfth)** District, **not** Cleveland.\n\nPutting this together, the most accurate factual statement we can make from the cited sources is:\n> For the Cleveland District, the Beige Book indicates a **slight overall increase in employment across the economy**, but it **does not provide any specific information on nonprofit employment**, nor does it document a rise or fall in nonprofit jobs. Any stronger claim\u2014such as a decline in nonprofit headcount\u2014would go beyond the evidence available.\n\n[Sources: BeigeBook_20251015 \u2013 Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Summary of Economic Activity; Labor Markets; Nonfinancial Services; Community Conditions; and cross\u2011district comparisons in the same Beige Book release.]",

      "question": "How did artificial intelligence affect employment decisions?",
      "expected": "In some cases, employers cited increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies as a reason for lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition.",
      "predicted": "Artificial intelligence affected employment decisions mainly by enabling employers to reduce or slow staffing, especially in roles held by less\u2011experienced workers, and by shaping expectations about future cuts. The Beige Book evidence describes **cause\u2011and\u2011effect chains** rather than detailed algorithms or fairness metrics.\n\n1. **AI investments causing reductions in certain jobs**  \n- In the San Francisco District, **employers invested in AI at the same time they reduced staff**:\n  - This was caused by firms adopting AI \u201c**particularly for positions and tasks usually reserved for less experienced employees**.\u201d As a result, some of the work previously done by these less\u2011experienced workers could be automated or handled with fewer people, and employers **coupled employment reductions with these AI investments**.\n  - As a result, opportunities for entry\u2011level or less\u2011experienced workers were squeezed: employers were **holding headcounts steady**, hiring mainly to replace departures, while simultaneously substituting AI for some junior tasks.\n\n2. **AI adoption leading to expectations of future headcount cuts**  \n- In the Atlanta District, **early generative AI implementation results changed how firms planned their future staffing**:\n  - This was caused by those early AI results convincing some firms that they could maintain operations with fewer workers. As a result, **\u201csome firms in the District expect further head count reductions based on early Generative AI implementation results, particularly if demand slows further.\u201d**\n  - As a result, AI didn\u2019t just coincide with current staffing decisions; it **shaped expectations** that, if business conditions weaken, AI will allow firms to cut more jobs rather than hire or redeploy workers.\n  - At the same time, firms described a **\u201chiring chill\u201d**\u2014welcomed attrition and **fewer headcount additions even in growth areas**. This was caused partly by a cautious outlook on demand and, in context, by the fact that AI was making it easier to meet needs without expanding staff. As a result, hiring slowed, especially for new or marginal roles.\n\n3. **Mechanisms used: layoffs and attrition instead of expansion**  \n- Nationally and across districts, employment was described as **largely flat**, but the way employers managed headcount shows how AI factored into decisions:\n  - Employers reduced staff **through both layoffs and attrition**. This was caused by a combination of **weaker demand, economic uncertainty, and, in some cases, AI adoption**. As a result, firms often chose not to backfill departing workers and, in some cases, actively laid people off while bringing in AI tools.\n  - In the San Francisco District, **manufacturing and health care** contacts reported reductions in staff via attrition, layoffs, and early retirements. This was caused mainly by broader cost and demand pressures; in some cases, those reductions were **paired with AI investments**, indicating AI was one of the tools enabling smaller staffs.\n  - As a result, AI was used more to **streamline staffing**\u2014reducing or holding down headcount\u2014than to support broad new hiring or expansion.\n\n4. **Who was most affected: less\u2011experienced and entry\u2011level workers**  \n- The clearest group affected was workers in **positions \u201cusually reserved for less experienced employees.\u201d**\n  - This was caused by firms targeting AI at more routine, junior\u2011level tasks that are easiest to automate. As a result, the **direct impact fell on less\u2011experienced or entry\u2011level roles**, even though the Beige Book does not list specific job titles.\n  - Because employers were already in a \u201chiring chill\u201d and managing headcount via attrition, as AI took over some junior tasks, **fewer new entry\u2011level positions were likely created or backfilled**. As a result, the pathway into the labor market narrowed even if total employment stayed roughly flat.\n\n5. **AI\u2019s role in HR decision automation vs. traditional HR processes**  \n- The evidence describes AI primarily as **a tool for automating work and enabling smaller staffs**, not as a detailed HR decision engine:\n  - This was caused by firms focusing AI on task automation (what work gets done and by how many people) rather than on **who** gets promoted or fired. As a result, AI shows up in the Beige Book in connection with **headcount levels (hiring, attrition, layoffs)**, not in descriptions of automated promotion or termination criteria.\n  - There is no mention of AI systems directly managing **promotion, firing criteria, or scheduling** decisions in the cited passages. As a result, we cannot say from this evidence that AI changed how individual employees were evaluated, only that it changed **how many** employees firms believed they needed.\n\n6. **Effects on fairness or bias in employment decisions**  \n- The Beige Book excerpts do **not** report on AI\u2011driven **fairness or bias** in hiring, promotion, or firing:\n  - This absence is caused by the report\u2019s focus: it summarizes economic conditions and staffing levels, not algorithmic discrimination or regulatory issues. As a result, it does not discuss whether AI tools made employment decisions more or less biased.\n  - As a result, from these sources alone, **no conclusion can be drawn** about whether AI increased or reduced bias or changed fairness in individual employment decisions.\n\n7. **Overall cause\u2011effect picture**  \n- **AI adoption and generative AI pilots** \u2192 showed firms they could perform the same or similar work with fewer, especially junior, workers.  \n- This was caused by AI\u2019s ability to automate routine tasks and by firms\u2019 focus on cost control amid uncertain demand.  \n- **As a result**:\n  - Some employers **paired employment reductions with AI investments**, particularly in positions for less\u2011experienced workers.\n  - Firms in at least one district **expected further headcount cuts** if demand weakened, explicitly because of early generative AI results.\n  - Employers widely used **attrition and layoffs** rather than expansion, contributing to **flat overall employment** but fewer entry\u2011level opportunities.\n  - The documented impact of AI is on **how many people were hired or retained and at what experience level**, not on the **fairness** of specific hiring or promotion decisions.\n\nWithin these limits, AI\u2019s main documented effect on employment decisions in the Beige Book is to **enable and justify leaner staffing\u2014especially at the low\u2011experience end of the workforce\u2014rather than to alter the fairness mechanics of HR decisions.**",

      "expected": "Higher-income individuals maintained strong spending on luxury travel and accommodation. Lower- and middle-income households sought discounts and promotions due to rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. This bifurcation was driven by rising prices eroding purchasing power for lower/middle-income groups while higher-income groups remained insulated.",
      "predicted": "Consumer spending patterns differed sharply by income group, and those differences can be traced to how inflation, uncertainty, and budget constraints affected each group\u2019s choices.\n\n1. Lower- and middle-income households: tighter budgets \u2192 price sensitivity \u2192 value-seeking and selective cutbacks\n\n- Rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty **tightened budget constraints** for lower- and middle-income households. This was caused by inflation eroding their real incomes and leaving less room for discretionary purchases. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- As a result, these households became **highly price-sensitive** and **value-focused**:\n  - They increasingly **sought discounts, promotions, and markdowns**, and engaged in **comparative price shopping** across categories, including retail goods and vacations. [National Summary; Richmond > Summary of Economic Activity]\n  - This was caused by the need to stretch limited budgets, making every dollar count more.\n- Because they waited for bargains, **sales and promotions could trigger small, temporary surges in their spending**:\n  - This was caused by pent\u2011up demand that could only be realized when prices dropped enough to fit within tight budgets.\n  - As a result, their consumption became **more volatile**, rising around deals and softening between them. [National Summary]\n- They **pulled back selectively on discretionary items**:\n  - Contacts noted that middle-income consumers were increasingly cautious, **cutting back on discretionary goods** and some services. [St. Louis > Consumer Spending; Chicago > Consumer Spending]\n  - This was caused by the need to prioritize essentials and perceived \u201cgood value\u201d purchases when money was tight.\n- In restaurants, they **traded down and trimmed extras** rather than stop dining out entirely:\n  - Some consumers cut discretionary add\u2011ons such as **desserts and alcoholic beverages**. This was caused by a desire to lower the total bill while keeping the core dining experience. [Richmond > Retail, Travel, and Tourism]\n  - At the same time, spending **shifted toward quick-service/fast food**, which continued to see solid revenue growth. This was caused by its lower price point and better perceived value, making it attractive to budget-conscious diners. [Richmond > Retail, Travel, and Tourism]\n  - As a result, **mid-range casual and family dining underperformed**, squeezed between luxury and fast-food options. [Richmond > Retail, Travel, and Tourism]\n- In travel and other services, lower- and middle-income groups **reduced or postponed some leisure spending**:\n  - Some Districts reported **softness in non-luxury travel-related leisure and hospitality**, even as certain goods (like appliances, computers, landscaping) held up better. [Chicago > Consumer Spending]\n  - This was caused by the need to cut higher-ticket, easily deferrable expenses first when budgets were stressed.\n\n2. Higher- and upper-income households: income buffers \u2192 lower sensitivity \u2192 resilient luxury and discretionary spending\n\n- Higher and more secure incomes **buffered upper-income households from inflation and uncertainty**. [National Summary]\n  - This was caused by larger financial cushions, higher savings, and more stable or higher earnings.\n  - As a result, they were **less price-sensitive** and did not need to cut back as aggressively when prices rose.\n- Their spending therefore remained **strong in discretionary and premium categories**:\n  - The national summary notes that **strong spending on luxury travel and accommodation** was driven by higher-income individuals. [National Summary]\n  - Boston reports that growth in accommodations demand was **\u201cfueled almost entirely by luxury accommodations,\u201d** with a widening gap between luxury and budget options. This was caused by affluent travelers continuing to spend freely while budget travelers pulled back. [Boston > Retail and Tourism]\n  - Philadelphia found that **only luxury leisure travel grew**, while most other tourism segments declined modestly. This was caused by weaker demand from non-luxury segments even as wealthy travelers maintained or increased trips. [Philadelphia > Trade and Services]\n  - St. Louis noted that **upper-income households and corporate clients** continued spending on **travel, events, and luxury services** despite a slight overall decline in consumer spending. [St. Louis > Consumer Spending]\n  - Richmond noted that **higher-end retailers and luxury restaurants** posted solid revenue growth. This was caused by continued patronage from higher-income customers. [Richmond > Retail, Travel, and Tourism]\n- As a result, **luxury and higher-end segments** of retail, dining, and travel were relatively resilient, even while mass-market or budget segments weakened.\n\n3. Goods vs. services: broad goods softness vs. luxury services resilience, driven by who could still spend\n\n- Nationally, **overall consumer spending\u2014especially on retail goods\u2014inched down**. [National Summary]\n  - This was caused largely by cautious behavior among lower- and middle-income households, who cut or delayed discretionary goods purchases as their budgets tightened.\n  - Chicago reported weakness in certain **consumer electronics and building materials**, illustrating this discretionary goods pullback. [Chicago > Consumer Spending]\n- At the same time, **many services tied to higher-income consumers held up or grew**:\n  - Luxury travel and accommodations nationwide; luxury accommodations in Boston; luxury leisure travel in Philadelphia; luxury dining and services in Richmond and St. Louis all remained strong. [National Summary; Boston; Philadelphia; Richmond; St. Louis]\n  - This was caused by the continued willingness and ability of higher- and upper-income consumers to spend on experiences and premium services, even as other groups retrenched.\n- As a result, the **overall pattern** was: \n  - Weakness concentrated in **mass-market retail goods and non-luxury services** (where lower- and middle-income consumers dominate).\n  - Resilience or growth in **luxury and high-end services and retail**, driven by higher-income households.\n\n4. Summary of cause\u2013effect by income group\n\n- Lower- and middle-income households:\n  - **Cause:** Inflation + economic uncertainty + tight budgets.\n  - **Effects:**\n    - Heightened price sensitivity and value-seeking.\n    - Greater reliance on discounts, promotions, and comparative shopping.\n    - Selective cutbacks in discretionary goods and some services.\n    - Trading down in restaurants (toward quick-service) and trimming extras.\n    - More volatile spending, with small surges when bargains appear.\n\n- Higher- and upper-income households:\n  - **Cause:** Higher, more secure incomes and financial buffers.\n  - **Effects:**\n    - Lower sensitivity to price increases.\n    - Continued or stronger spending on luxury travel, accommodations, dining, and services.\n    - Better performance at higher-end retailers and service providers, even as overall retail goods spending softened.\n\nIn short, the **same macro forces\u2014higher prices and uncertainty\u2014produced opposite spending responses** across income groups: they forced lower- and middle-income households to hunt for value and pull back on discretionary items, while higher-income households, insulated by stronger finances, continued to fuel robust demand in luxury and premium segments.",

Generative AI adoption thus contributed to firms planning to shrink, rather than expand, their workforce.  \n   - [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n3. **Technology and AI as labor substitutes rather than job creators**  \n   - Across these reports, AI and related technology spending is often treated as a **substitute for labor**, not primarily as a complement that would boost hiring. This was caused by firms\u2019 strategic choice to use AI to improve efficiency and reduce costs, rather than to support large-scale expansion of staff.  \n   - As a result, **increased AI-related capital spending coincided with tempered labor demand**\u2014firms invested in software, automation, and AI tools while becoming more cautious about adding workers or even planning workforce reductions.  \n   - [Sources: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n4. **Contrasting cases where tech investment did *not* affect employment**  \n   - In the **Boston District**, contacts reported that technology spending was **unchanged**, and there was **no direct link** noted between this spending and hiring or layoffs.  \n   - This suggests that the **causal relationship between AI investment and employment trends varies by region and sector**. Where AI is being actively deployed to automate tasks (Atlanta, San Francisco), it is causing hiring slowdowns and job cuts; where tech investment is flat or less focused on automation (Boston), Beige Book contacts did not report a clear employment impact.  \n   - [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n5. **Broader context: weaker activity vs. AI-specific effects**  \n   - In the **Cleveland District**, weaker business activity was reported as the cause of reduced labor demand, **not specifically AI investment**.  \n   - As a result, in Cleveland, employment softening is attributed more to the overall economic environment than to AI or automation. This contrast highlights that while AI is an important *additional* driver of employment trends in some districts, it is one factor among several shaping labor demand nationally.  \n   - [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Overall causal relationship:**  \n- Where AI investment is active and targeted at automating existing tasks (especially routine or entry-level work), **this has caused firms to reduce current staff, slow hiring, and anticipate further headcount cuts**, thereby contributing to softer employment trends in those districts.  \n- In other districts, employment trends are more strongly caused by general economic conditions, with AI playing a smaller or unreported role.\n",

Overall economic trajectory\n\n**Growth / improving districts**  \n- Nationally, three districts reported **slight to modest growth**; examples with clear evidence include **Philadelphia**, **Richmond**, and districts with **neutral\u2011to\u2011positive outlooks** such as **Boston** and **Cleveland** (flat now but expecting growth). [BeigeBook_20251015 National Summary; Evidence 3; Evidence 1\u20132, 4\u20135, 8\u201310]\n- **Philadelphia (Third District):** \u201cBusiness activity \u2026 **increased slightly**,\u201d employment also **increased slightly**, with modest wage and moderate price increases. Firms **generally expect modest growth over the next six months**. [Evidence 1\u20132, 5, 8\u20139]\n- **Richmond (Fifth District):** The economy **continued to grow modestly** (from prior district text). Labor markets were \u201con balance **unchanged**,\u201d implying modest growth overall with flat employment. [Evidence 8]\n- **Boston (First District):** The outlook was described as **\u201cneutral to cautiously optimistic,\u201d** indicating no clear current surge in activity but a **non\u2011negative, slightly positive** forward view. (Corrected from earlier misstatement that activity \u201cexpanded slightly.\u201d)\n- **Cleveland (Fourth District):** Business activity was **flat** in recent weeks, but contacts **\u201cexpected activity to increase modestly in the months ahead.\u201d** Certain sectors (commercial construction, financial services) already saw upticks. [Evidence 4, 10]\n\n**Decline / weakening districts**  \n- Four districts nationally had **slight softening**, including **New York**, **Minneapolis**, and **Kansas City**, plus others such as **San Francisco** in the broader context. [Evidence 3; prior district text]\n- **New York (Second District):** \u201cEconomic activity \u2026 **continued to decline slightly**.\u201d Employment held steady; wage growth modest; prices still rising at an elevated but steady pace. [Evidence 10]\n- **Minneapolis (Ninth District):** \u201cEconomic activity was **slightly down**,\u201d with employment **flat to slightly down** and modest price increases. [Evidence 7, 9]\n- **Kansas City (Tenth District):** Overall economic activity **\u201cfell slightly\u201d**, and employment edged down, placing it in the \u201cslight softening\u201d group. (This comes from the district text cited earlier; not fully repeated in the new evidence.)\n- In the broader Beige Book: **San Francisco** reported a **slight decline**, and **Chicago** was **flat**, while **St. Louis** had flat activity but a **slightly pessimistic** tone. [Broader Beige Book context]\n\n**Comparison:**  \n- Growth districts are either **already expanding slightly** (Philadelphia, Richmond) or **flat but turning up** (Cleveland, Boston\u2019s outlook).  \n- Decline districts are seeing **ongoing or recent slight drops** in activity (New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco), sometimes with flat employment but no clear rebound yet.\n\n---\n### 2. Near\u2011term outlook and expectations\n\n**Growth / improving districts**  \n- **Philadelphia:** Firms \u201c**generally expect modest growth** over the next six months\u201d and a \u201c**modest increase in economic activity**\u201d despite \u201cheightened economic uncertainty.\u201d [Evidence 1, 2, 7, 9]\n- **Cleveland:** Contacts \u201c**expected activity to increase modestly in the months ahead**,\u201d with some sectors already seeing more demand. [Evidence 4, 10]\n- **Boston:** Described as **\u201cneutral to cautiously optimistic\u201d**\u2014businesses are **not expecting a downturn**, and many see at least modest upside.\n- **Richmond:** Though explicit six\u2011month language is not in the new excerpts, characterization as **\u201ccontinued to grow modestly\u201d** implies a **steady, modestly positive** near\u2011term outlook.\n\n**Decline / weakening districts**  \n- **New York:** With activity that \u201c**continued to decline slightly**,\u201d contacts **do not expect much increase in activity** in the near term; the tone is **subdued**, with limited anticipated improvement. [Evidence 10; earlier summary]\n- **Minneapolis:** The \u201cslightly down\u201d description and flat\u2011to\u2011slightly\u2011down employment signal **softening**, with no strong near\u2011term rebound indicated; the tone is one of **modest weakening**, not crisis. [Evidence 7, 9]\n- **Kansas City:** Activity \u201cfell slightly.\u201d Earlier narrative suggested **generally positive medium\u2011term sentiment**, but **we lack a quoted passage** in the current evidence about specific 2026\u2011vs\u20112025 sales expectations; the near\u2011term is clearly **softer**.  \n- **St. Louis (Eighth District):** Overall outlook described as **\u201cslightly pessimistic\u201d** despite flat activity, implying **low or negative expectations** for near\u2011term growth. [Broader Beige Book context]\n- **Dallas:** Overall activity was flat, but **business outlooks deteriorated**, indicating **rising pessimism** even without current decline. [Broader Beige Book context]\n\n**Comparison:**  \n- Growth districts talk about **\u201cmodest growth,\u201d \u201cmodest increases,\u201d or \u201ccautious optimism\u201d** over the next few months.  \n- Decline districts emphasize **\u201ccontinued slight decline,\u201d \u201cslightly down,\u201d or \u201cslightly pessimistic\u201d** outlooks, with **little or no expected improvement**, and in some cases outright deterioration in sentiment (Dallas, St. Louis).\n\n---\n### 3. Labor markets and wages\n\n**Growth / improving districts**  \n- **Philadelphia:** Employment **increased slightly**; wages \u201cagain rose at **modest pre\u2011pandemic rates**.\u201d [Evidence 5, 8]\n- **Richmond:** Employment \u201con balance was **unchanged**,\u201d with some firms expanding headcount and others cutting to manage costs\u2014consistent with **stable to slightly positive** conditions in a modest\u2011growth district. [Evidence 8]\n- **Cleveland:** No major change in total activity, but modestly positive expectations; labor conditions are **stable**, fitting a flat\u2011to\u2011improving picture. [Evidence 4]\n\n**Decline / weakening districts**  \n- **New York:** Despite activity **declining slightly**, employment **held steady**; wage growth was modest, and price increases remained elevated but steady. [Evidence 10]\n- **Minneapolis:** Employment was **flat to slightly down**, consistent with **slightly weaker demand**. Wage growth was **moderate**, and prices increased modestly. [Evidence 7, 9]\n- **Kansas City:** Reported **slight declines in activity and employment** in the earlier district text, marking a **softening labor market**.\n\n**Comparison:**  \n- Growth districts show **flat\u2011to\u2011rising employment** and **modest wage increases** (Philadelphia, Richmond), consistent with **gradual expansion** or at least stability.  \n- Decline districts show **flat or slightly declining employment** (New York steady but with falling activity; Minneapolis and Kansas City slightly down), signaling **mild labor\u2011market softening** alongside weaker activity.\n\n---\n### 4. Prices, inflation, and cost pressures\n\n**Growth / improving districts**  \n- **Philadelphia:** Prices **continued to rise moderately**; wage growth modest. This is consistent with **controlled but ongoing inflation** in a modest\u2011growth setting. [Evidence 5]\n- **Cleveland:** Some sectors (like commercial construction and financial services) saw **increasing demand**, which can support prices; overall, the district expects **modest increases** in activity, not a price\u2011driven downturn. [Evidence 4]\n\n**Decline / weakening districts**  \n- **New York:** Price increases remained **elevated but little changed**, even as activity continued a slight decline, suggesting **persistent cost pressures** amid slower growth. [Evidence 10]\n- **Minneapolis:** Prices increased **modestly** despite slightly down activity, again indicating **moderate inflation** in a softening environment. [Evidence 7, 9]\n\n**Comparison:**  \n- Both sets of districts report **ongoing price increases**, but in growth districts (e.g., Philadelphia) this coincides with **rising activity and employment**, while in decline districts (New York, Minneapolis) **inflation coexists with soft or falling activity**, reinforcing a more challenging outlook.\n\n---\n### 5. Business sentiment and uncertainty\n\n**Growth / improving districts**  \n- **Philadelphia:** Even with \u201cheightened economic uncertainty,\u201d firms **\u201cgenerally expect modest growth\u201d** and a \u201cmodest increase in activity\u201d over six months, indicating **resilient but cautious confidence**. [Evidence 1, 7, 9]\n- **Boston:** \u201cNeutral to cautiously optimistic\u201d encapsulates a **balanced but slightly positive** sentiment\u2014businesses see more upside than downside, but are clearly aware of risks.\n- **Cleveland:** Flat current conditions paired with expected modest increases show **measured optimism**, especially in specific sectors (commercial construction, financial services). [Evidence 4]\n\n**Decline / weakening districts**  \n- **New York:** Ongoing slight decline and no expectation of much improvement reflect **subdued sentiment** and **limited risk\u2011taking appetite**. [Evidence 10]\n- **Minneapolis:** \u201cSlightly down\u201d activity and flat\u2011to\u2011down employment portray a **cautious or wary business mood** rather than optimism. [Evidence 7, 9]\n- **Kansas City:** Slight declines place it in the **\u201cslight softening\u201d** group; while earlier text suggested some longer\u2011term hope, the **current business climate is clearly weaker**.  \n- **St. Louis:** Explicitly \u201c**slightly pessimistic**\u201d outlook despite flat activity\u2014businesses are **anticipating more downside risk** than upside.  \n- **Dallas:** Even with flat activity, **business outlooks deteriorated**, indicating **rising concern** about the future.\n\n**Comparison:**  \n- Growth districts show **cautious confidence** (\u201cmodest growth,\u201d \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d).  \n- Decline districts emphasize **pessimism or at best muted expectations**, often highlighting risks and **limited improvement** rather than expansion.\n\n---\n### 6. Summary: How the economic outlook differs\n\n- **Path of activity**  \n  - *Growth districts (Philadelphia, Richmond, Boston\u2019s outlook, Cleveland)*: Either **slight current growth** or **flat with expected modest increases**.  \n  - *Decline districts (New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, plus St. Louis and Dallas in tone)*: **Slight ongoing declines or softening**, with some districts already seeing multiple periods of \u201ccontinued\u201d slight decline.\n\n- **Forward\u2011looking expectations**  \n  - *Growth*: Language like **\u201cmodest growth,\u201d \u201cmodest increase in activity,\u201d \u201cneutral to cautiously optimistic\u201d**, pointing to **gradual expansion** despite uncertainty.  \n  - *Decline*: Phrases such as **\u201ccontinued to decline slightly,\u201d \u201cslightly down,\u201d \u201cslightly pessimistic,\u201d \u201cdeterioration in outlooks\u201d** point to **weak or negative near\u2011term expectations**.\n\n- **Labor and prices**  \n  - *Growth*: Employment is **flat to slightly up**, wages rising modestly; price increases are **moderate**, consistent with a **soft\u2011landing / slow\u2011growth** environment.  \n  - *Decline*: Employment is **flat or slightly down**; prices still rising (modestly to elevated), creating a mix of **soft activity with ongoing cost pressures**.\n\nIn essence, districts that saw **growth or stabilizing conditions** (Philadelphia, Richmond, Boston\u2019s outlook, Cleveland) are looking for **modest expansion** in the near term, whereas districts with **recent declines or softening** (New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and others with pessimistic tones like St. Louis and Dallas) anticipate **little improvement or further mild weakening**, often under a cloud of greater pessimism and uncertainty.\n",

      "question": "How did trade-related concerns affect the agriculture sector across different districts?",
      "expected": "In the Minneapolis District, agricultural contacts were specifically concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases, representing a direct trade policy impact. In the St. Louis District, agriculture conditions were strained and further deteriorated, with the overall pessimistic outlook. Across reporting districts, activity in agriculture was generally down, with trade uncertainty adding to sector challenges.",
      "predicted": "Trade-related concerns affected agriculture mainly through export channels and foreign demand, but the size and direction of the impact differed by District. Below, each causal link is made explicit (\u201cthis was caused by\u2026\u201d, \u201cas a result\u2026\u201d). \n\n1. National backdrop\n- The Beige Book summary said that agricultural activity was **\u201cgenerally down\u201d** among reporting Districts.\n- This overall softness was **not caused by a single factor**; instead, trade-policy developments, weak foreign demand, low prices, and cost pressures each played a role, with different mixes by District.\n\n2. Districts where trade policy clearly hurt agriculture\n\nA. Atlanta (Sixth District)\n- **Cause \u2013 trade policy volatility and foreign buyers switching suppliers:**\n  - The Atlanta Fed reported that **\u201ctrade policy volatility weighed on agricultural exports.\u201d** Overseas buyers of U.S. rice **switched to other countries offering lower prices.**\n  - This was caused by **uncertainty and changes around trade policy**, which made U.S. rice relatively less attractive and encouraged foreign buyers to diversify or re\u2011source.\n- **Effect \u2013 weaker export sales for specific crops but overall \u201cmostly healthy\u201d conditions:**\n  - As a result, **overseas sales of domestic rice declined**, and trade-related concerns also weighed on crops such as **soybeans** via export channels.\n  - However, agriculture in the Sixth District was still described as **\u201cmostly healthy\u201d** overall. This was likely because **domestic demand and other segments of agriculture offset some of the export drag**, so trade-related weakness in exports caused **pressure** rather than an outright downturn in the broader farm economy.\n\nB. San Francisco (Twelfth District)\n- **Cause \u2013 trade policy adjustments and negotiations reducing foreign demand, especially from China:**\n  - The San Francisco Fed reported that **\u201cdemand from abroad, particularly from China, reportedly continued to fall because of trade policy adjustments and negotiations.\u201d**\n  - This fall in demand was **directly caused by changes and uncertainty in trade policy**, which made Chinese and other foreign buyers pull back from purchasing U.S. agricultural products from the Twelfth District.\n- **Effect \u2013 slightly weaker agricultural and resource-related conditions:**\n  - As a result, **\u201cconditions in agriculture and resource-related sectors weakened slightly\u201d** in the Twelfth District.\n  - The causal chain ran: **trade policy adjustments and negotiations \u2192 reduced foreign demand (especially China) \u2192 slightly weaker agricultural conditions** despite no indication of severe production problems.\n\n3. Districts with weaker agriculture but drivers not clearly tied to trade\n\nA. Minneapolis (Ninth District)\n- **Cause \u2013 low crop prices and elevated expenses (not explicitly linked to trade in the text):**\n  - The Minneapolis Fed noted that **agricultural conditions weakened**, while **corn and soybean production was very strong**.\n  - This weakening was **caused by \u201clow crop prices and elevated expenses\u201d** weighing on producer incomes, not by any explicitly stated trade policy or export shock in the available evidence.\n- **Effect \u2013 income pressure despite strong harvests:**\n  - As a result, farm incomes were squeezed: **record or near-record harvests of corn and soybeans did not translate into stronger financial conditions**, because low prices and high costs eroded revenue and profits.\n  - Trade may have been in the background, but based on the text provided, the **documented causal story** is: strong production + low prices + high costs \u2192 **weaker agricultural conditions**, with no explicit mention of trade as the trigger for the low prices.\n\nB. St. Louis (Eighth District)\n- **Observed outcome \u2013 strained and deteriorating conditions, but cause unspecified:**\n  - The St. Louis Fed reported that agricultural conditions **\u201care strained\u201d** and **\u201chave further deteriorated.\u201d**\n- **Causal gap in the evidence:**\n  - The excerpt does **not** say whether this strain was caused by **trade-related concerns, low prices, weather, credit conditions, or other factors**.\n  - As a result, we can state only that agriculture was **under stress**, but we **cannot causally attribute** that stress to trade from the evidence provided.\n\n4. Districts where conditions were not clearly down, but uncertainty was elevated\n\nA. Chicago (Seventh District)\n- **Cause \u2013 elevated uncertainty (source not specified):**\n  - The Chicago Fed reported that **\u201cnet farm income prospects for the District were unchanged\u201d**, and that **\u201celevated uncertainty continued to unsettle agricultural operators.\u201d** Corn and soybean fields were \u201cin good shape\u201d across most of the District.\n- **Effect \u2013 stable incomes but unsettled decision\u2011making:**\n  - As a result, farmers faced **unchanged near\u2011term income prospects** but were **hesitant or uneasy in planning**, because of this uncertainty.\n  - The text does **not** explicitly say that this uncertainty was **caused by trade policy or export issues**, so we cannot firmly claim that trade-related concerns were the source, even though they may have been one contributing factor in the broader environment.\n\n5. How and why the effects differed across Districts\n\nPutting the Districts side by side shows how trade-related concerns translated into different outcomes:\n\n- **Atlanta (Sixth)**\n  - **Cause:** Trade policy volatility \u2192 foreign buyers source rice elsewhere at lower prices.\n  - **Effect:** Rice exports (and some soybean\u2011related exports) declined; exports were under pressure, **but overall agriculture remained \u201cmostly healthy.\u201d**\n\n- **San Francisco (Twelfth)**\n  - **Cause:** Trade policy adjustments and negotiations \u2192 foreign demand, especially from China, fell.\n  - **Effect:** **Slight weakening** in agriculture and resource-related sectors; foreign demand channels were a clear drag on conditions.\n\n- **Minneapolis (Ninth)**\n  - **Cause:** Low crop prices and high expenses (causes of price weakness not specified) \u2192 incomes squeezed.\n  - **Effect:** Agriculture weakened even with strong corn and soybean output; this was **primarily a price/cost story**, not clearly a trade story in the text.\n\n- **St. Louis (Eighth)**\n  - **Cause:** Not specified in the excerpt.\n  - **Effect:** Agriculture conditions \u201cstrained\u201d and deteriorating, but **no documented link** to trade-related concerns in the available evidence.\n\n- **Chicago (Seventh)**\n  - **Cause:** Elevated uncertainty from unspecified sources.\n  - **Effect:** Net farm income prospects unchanged, good crop conditions, but **operators were unsettled**; the role of trade in causing that uncertainty is **not explicitly documented**.\n\n6. Overall causal picture\n- **Where the trade channel is explicit (Atlanta and San Francisco):**\n  - Trade-policy changes and volatility **caused** foreign buyers to reduce or re\u2011route purchases, especially for **rice (Atlanta)** and for exports to **China (San Francisco)**.\n  - As a result, these Districts saw **weaker exports and slightly weaker overall agricultural conditions**, though Atlanta\u2019s sector remained mostly healthy thanks to offsetting strengths.\n\n- **Where other factors dominated (Minneapolis) or causes are unclear (St. Louis, Chicago):**\n  - In Minneapolis, **low prices and high costs** clearly **caused** weaker farm incomes despite strong yields.\n  - In St. Louis, agriculture was **strained**, but the Beige Book excerpt does not identify a cause, so any claim that trade was responsible would be speculative.\n  - In Chicago, **uncertainty** unsettled farmers, but the text does not link that uncertainty specifically to trade; incomes were **unchanged**.\n\nThus, trade-related concerns most clearly affected agriculture in the **Atlanta (Sixth)** and **San Francisco (Twelfth)** Districts by **reducing export demand and weakening conditions**, while other Districts saw agriculture weaken for **non\u2011trade or unspecified reasons**, leading to a **mixed and uneven impact** of trade-related concerns across the country.\n",

The Beige Book evidence is qualitative and district-specific, so the cause\u2013effect links below are drawn from what is explicitly reported for each district.\n\n---\n### Core causal mechanism across districts\n\n**Cause:**\n- Heightened **uncertainty about federal grants and funding** (e.g., whether grants would be renewed, at what level, and when), and in some places **reductions in federal benefit programs**.\n\n**Direct financial effects on nonprofits:**\n- This was caused by changes and uncertainty in federal policy and appropriations that made federal funding **less predictable** and, in some cases, **smaller**.\n- As a result, nonprofits experienced:\n  - Decreased or less predictable revenue from federal sources.\n  - Greater reliance on reserve funds.\n  - Tighter budgets and more cautious financial planning.\n\n**Operational and service-delivery effects:**\n- This funding uncertainty and tightening was caused by federal policy shifts and grant uncertainty.\n- As a result, nonprofits:\n  - Left positions unfilled or trimmed staff.\n  - Reprioritized which services to offer or expand.\n  - Slowed or delayed previously planned projects.\n  - Struggled with rising demand (in some districts) at the same time their capacity was constrained.\n\nBelow, these patterns are broken out by district to show how the same federal-policy-driven pressures played out differently.\n\n---\n### Cleveland District\n\n**Cause:** Uncertainty around federal grants and reduced funding reported in a semiannual survey of nonprofits.\n\n**Financial effects:**\n- A growing share of surveyed nonprofits reported that their **funding had decreased over the past six months**.\n  - This was caused by uncertainty and tightening around federal grants.\n  - As a result, at least one nonprofit **had to dip into its reserve fund to cover operating expenses** for the first time in more than ten years.\n\n**Staffing and hiring:**\n- One survey respondent reported that the **nonprofit sector was not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants**.\n  - This was caused by fear that expected federal grant money might not materialize or might be cut.\n  - As a result, nonprofits chose **not to hire for vacancies**, effectively shrinking staff capacity without formal layoffs.\n\n---\n### Chicago District\n\n**Cause:** Reduced income and donations paired with ongoing uncertainty about economic conditions and federal funding, in the broader policy environment.\n\n**Budget planning:**\n- Nonprofit organizations, in planning for 2026, **anticipated the need to adapt to smaller budgets**.\n  - This was caused by expectations of tighter funding\u2014including from federal sources\u2014and weaker donations.\n  - As a result, nonprofits began **planning ahead for leaner operations**, rather than assuming stable or growing budgets.\n\n**Costs and service prioritization:**\n- Social service contacts reported that **increased operating costs combined with reduced income and donations** were forcing them to think carefully about **which services to prioritize**.\n  - Higher operating costs were caused by general inflationary pressures; reduced income and donations were partly caused by the same economic and policy uncertainty that clouded federal support.\n  - As a result, nonprofits **reordered their service mix**, protecting some programs while scaling back or delaying others, even though:\n    - Community and nonprofit contacts overall reported **no change in activity** during the period.\n    - This means that activity remained roughly flat, but **internal allocation of resources and services shifted** in response to financial strain.\n\n---\n### New York District\n\n**Cause:** Unpredictable funding streams and a **reduction in federal benefit programs**.\n\n**Nonprofit funding conditions:**\n- \u201cMany nonprofits\u201d reported **challenges due to unpredictable funding and a reduction in federal benefit programs**.\n  - This was caused by federal policy changes that reduced or reshaped benefit programs (for example, changes affecting Medicaid patients are mentioned) and made funding flows less reliable.\n  - As a result, nonprofits faced **greater financial volatility** and had more difficulty planning and sustaining services.\n\n**Effects on clients and service pressure:**\n- A community health-care center noted rising financial distress among Medicaid patients, which **limited patients\u2019 access to care**.\n  - This was caused by reductions in federal benefit support and rising economic pressures on low\u2011income clients.\n  - As a result, nonprofits serving these populations faced **higher need with shakier funding**, forcing them to stretch resources further and complicating their ability to maintain access to care.\n\n---\n### Dallas District\n\n**Cause:** A tighter financial and policy environment, including uncertainty around public funding, feeding into nonprofit cost-cutting.\n\n**Staffing cutbacks:**\n- Nonprofits in the Dallas District **trimmed head counts over the reporting period**.\n  - This was caused by budget pressures and concerns about the reliability of future funding, including federal sources, in a softening economic environment.\n  - As a result, nonprofits **reduced staff levels**, which likely constrained their ability to provide services even if demand did not fall.\n\n*(The evidence does not explicitly tie Dallas staffing cuts to a specific federal program; the link is inferred from the broader policy and funding context.)*\n\n---\n### St. Louis District\n\n**Cause:** Rising needs in the community amid a constrained funding environment.\n\n**Demand-side pressure:**\n- Nonprofit organizations **reported a growing demand for their services**.\n  - This was caused by worsening economic and social conditions for households\u2014even as public and philanthropic resources were not clearly expanding to match.\n  - As a result, nonprofits had to **serve more people with roughly the same or uncertain resources**, creating operational strain.\n\n*(The St. Louis evidence explicitly documents rising demand; it does not explicitly document federal funding cuts, though those are part of the national backdrop.)*\n\n---\n### Philadelphia District\n\n**Cause:** **Uncertainty about the status of federal funding** for planned projects.\n\n**Project delays and slower expansion:**\n- A Philadelphia contact reported that **uncertainty surrounding the status of federal funding was slowing previously planned projects**.\n  - This was caused by not knowing whether promised or expected federal dollars would actually be available.\n  - As a result, nonprofits (or related organizations) **delayed or slowed projects**\u2014such as facilities, programs, or expansions\u2014instead of moving ahead at the original pace.\n\n---\n### San Francisco (Twelfth) District\n\n**Cause:** **Funding and grant cuts** affecting community support organizations.\n\n**Capacity reductions and rising need:**\n- Community support organizations reported that **funding and grant cuts limited their capacity** and that they **had reduced capacity to provide assistance due to funding and grant cuts**.\n  - These cuts were caused by changes and reductions in public and philanthropic grantmaking, including federal-related support.\n  - As a result, organizations **scaled back what they could offer**, even as:\n    - Demand for assistance\u2014especially for **food, basic necessities, and health care**\u2014was rising.\n    - This mismatch between **higher demand and lower capacity** directly reduced the amount of help nonprofits could provide.\n\n---\n### Cross-district patterns and differences\n\nAcross the cited districts, the same underlying force\u2014greater **uncertainty and/or cuts in federal funding and benefits**\u2014produced different but related outcomes:\n\n- **Budget tightening and financial strain**\n  - Caused by: Decreased or unpredictable federal grants and benefit funding.\n  - As a result: \n    - Cleveland nonprofits reported **decreased funding** and dipped into reserves.\n    - Chicago nonprofits **planned for smaller 2026 budgets**.\n\n- **Staffing reductions or hiring freezes**\n  - Caused by: Concern that future federal funding would not support current staffing levels.\n  - As a result:\n    - Cleveland respondents said nonprofits were **not filling open positions**.\n    - Dallas nonprofits **trimmed head counts**.\n\n- **Reprioritizing services and internal reallocation**\n  - Caused by: Higher operating costs combined with reduced or uncertain revenue tied in part to federal policy.\n  - As a result:\n    - Chicago social service organizations **re\u2011evaluated which services to prioritize**.\n    - San Francisco\u2013area community support organizations **reduced capacity** and focused on what they could still sustain despite cuts.\n\n- **Delaying or slowing projects and growth**\n  - Caused by: Uncertainty about whether planned federal funding would arrive.\n  - As a result:\n    - Philadelphia contacts reported **slower implementation of previously planned projects**.\n\n- **Rising demand meeting shrinking or unstable support**\n  - Caused by: Economic stress on households plus reductions in federal benefits (e.g., in New York) and broader social needs.\n  - As a result:\n    - St. Louis nonprofits experienced **growing demand for services**.\n    - San Francisco organizations saw **rising demand for food, basic necessities, and health care** while capacity fell.\n    - New York nonprofits faced **higher client need** (e.g., distressed Medicaid patients) amid **unpredictable funding**.\n\nIn sum, federal policy changes\u2014felt through **uncertain and reduced grants and benefit programs**\u2014caused nonprofits in various districts to **tighten budgets, cut or freeze staffing, reprioritize services, delay projects, and in some places reduce capacity**, even as demand for their services often increased. The exact mix of effects differed by district, but the causal chain from federal funding uncertainty to nonprofit financial strain to operational adjustments is consistent across the reported cases.\n",

[National Summary > Prices, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n- Some firms **raised selling prices**, sometimes citing tariffs explicitly; others **kept prices largely unchanged**, absorbing costs or using existing (pre\u2011tariff) inventory.

[Dallas > Prices, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n  - **Richmond:** Manufacturers cited tariffs as a driver of **faster price growth**. [Richmond > Summary of Economic Activity, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n  - **Minneapolis:** Several manufacturers had **recently increased prices specifically in response to tariffs**; about **one\u2011fifth of firms** raised prices in September and a similar share anticipated further increases. [Minneapolis > Prices, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n  - **Philadelphia:** Some suppliers (often manufacturing or goods\u2011producing) explicitly cited **tariffs when raising prices**, even where the goods were **not themselves directly tariffed**, using tariffs as the rationale. [Philadelphia > Prices, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n\n**Extent of pass\u2011through vs. absorption**\n- **Variation, not uniform full pass\u2011through:** Nationally, the Beige Book stresses that **\u201cthe extent to which tariff\u2011induced input cost increases passed through to final prices varied across many Districts.\u201d** It does **not** say manufacturers fully passed all tariff costs on.

[Richmond > Prices, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n- **Who bore the burden:** Earlier qualitative descriptions indicate that **smaller manufacturers\u2019 customers often bore a larger share of tariff\u2011induced costs** (i.e., relatively higher pass\u2011through by smaller producers), but the cited Beige Book passages **do not quantify** this or clearly separate small vs. large manufacturers. [National Summary, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n\n**Strategic aspects**\n- Manufacturers commonly used **straightforward list\u2011price increases** once tariffs raised input costs.\n- Some firms reportedly worked through **pre\u2011tariff inventories** to delay price hikes or smooth adjustments. [National Summary; New York; St. Louis, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n- Evidence of more elaborate pricing\u2011structure changes (e.g., complex surcharges or new fee menus) is **limited in the excerpts**; the clearest strategic element is firms **framing** increases explicitly as \u201cbecause of tariffs,\u201d as seen in Philadelphia. [Philadelphia > Prices, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n\n### B. Services\n\n**Direction and timing of price changes**\n- Service providers faced **higher costs** related to tariffs indirectly (e.g., through imported materials, equipment, or higher costs of insurance, health care, technology solutions, and utilities), but **price responses were more muted or delayed**:\n  - The **National Summary** notes that these service inputs were an important part of overall cost increases, alongside tariffs, but **does not document strong, broad-based service price spikes tied directly to tariffs**. [National Summary > Prices, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n\n**Pass\u2011through vs. absorption**\n- **Richmond:** Service firms, like manufacturers, reported that **\u201csome of the higher input costs associated with tariffs had yet to be passed along to customers\u201d**\u2014a clear sign of **incomplete pass\u2011through and margin absorption** in services. [Richmond > Prices, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n- Nationally, the narrative indicates that **many service firms showed little change in price growth** and had **not yet passed on tariff\u2011related input costs**, though specific named examples by industry (e.g., IT consulting, logistics) are not given in the excerpts. [National Summary > Prices, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n\n**Strategic aspects**\n- The available evidence suggests that service firms tended to **hold posted prices steady** and absorb costs, at least in the short run, to preserve demand and contracts.\n- Detailed strategies such as **changing fee structures, adding surcharges, or re\u2011bundling services** in explicit response to tariffs are **not documented** in the cited passages.\n\n**Comparison: Manufacturing vs. Services**\n- **Speed and magnitude:** Manufacturing prices generally **responded faster and more strongly** to tariff shocks than service prices, which changed less or later. [Dallas; Richmond; Minneapolis; National Summary, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n- **Pass\u2011through:** Manufacturers more often **passed at least some costs on**, whereas service firms showed more **cost absorption** and **incomplete pass\u2011through**.\n- **Documentation:** Manufacturing examples (Dallas, Minneapolis, Philadelphia suppliers) are explicit; service\u2011sector examples are **more generic** in the National Summary and Richmond text, without rich industry detail.\n\n---\n## 3. Retail Trade and Consumer\u2011Facing Firms vs. Upstream / Foreign Suppliers\n\n### A. Retail and other consumer\u2011facing goods sellers\n\n**Price increases vs. caution**\n- **National pattern:** Many goods\u2011oriented firms (including retailers) **raised selling prices** when tariffs lifted import costs, with some reports describing **full pass\u2011through** in individual cases; however, the national summary again emphasizes **variation** and not uniform behavior. [National Summary > Prices, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n- **Kansas City (consumer spending):** Several firms became **more cautious about passing along higher input costs** to manage **softer sales**, indicating **partial or delayed pass\u2011through** in consumer\u2011facing sectors. The excerpt does not explicitly tie these particular costs to tariffs, but they occurred in the same environment of tariff\u2011driven pressures. [Kansas City > Consumer Spending, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n\n**Firm size and competitive strategy**\n- Qualitative evidence (not backed by precise Beige Book numbers in the excerpts) suggests that:\n  - Some **larger or better\u2011positioned retailers** were more willing or able to **raise prices** to cover tariff costs.\n  - Some **smaller or regional retailers** reportedly **delayed or only partially raised prices** to maintain competitive positioning, absorbing more of the costs in margins or seeking efficiencies instead. This small\u2011retailer pattern, however, is **not specifically documented with District\u2011level quotes** in the provided text and should be treated as an inference rather than directly cited fact. [Beige Book 2025\u201110\u201115 summary]\n\n**Comparison to manufacturing and services**\n- Like manufacturers, many retailers **did pass through** higher costs, sometimes fully on particular lines, especially when import content was high and demand relatively inelastic.\n- But similar to services and to Kansas City\u2019s report, **some retailers were cautious**, holding prices steady or slowing the pace of increases to avoid losing customers in a softening demand environment.\n\n### B. Upstream and foreign suppliers\n\n**Absorbing costs to protect relationships**\n- In some **import\u2011intensive supply chains** (for example, pharmaceuticals or other sectors heavily reliant on foreign inputs), **foreign manufacturers and upstream suppliers absorbed part of the tariff costs**. They did this to preserve market share, maintain production levels, and keep downstream demand intact. [BeigeBook_20251015, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n- This behavior **limited immediate downstream price hikes** for U.S. distributors, retailers, and in some cases final consumers, effectively **sharing the tariff burden** between foreign producers and domestic firms.\n\n**Comparison: Retailers vs. Upstream suppliers**\n- **Retailers** were balancing pressure from higher landed costs against competition and demand, sometimes passing costs on, sometimes absorbing.\n- **Foreign/upstream suppliers** occasionally acted as a buffer by **partially absorbing tariffs**, which reduced the need for immediate, full retail price increases.\n\n---\n## 4. Absorbing costs vs. raising prices: Sector\u2011by\u2011sector trade\u2011offs\n\n**Manufacturing**\n- More frequent and sharper **price increases** in response to tariffs, especially in Districts like Dallas and Minneapolis. [Dallas; Minneapolis, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n- Nonetheless, **not all tariff costs were passed through**; Richmond explicitly notes that some tariff\u2011related costs were **still being absorbed** rather than priced in. [Richmond > Prices, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n\n**Services**\n- Tariffs contributed to higher input costs (directly or via higher prices for goods and business services), but **service firms more often absorbed these costs**, at least initially.\n- **Less aggressive pricing**: Many service firms showed **little immediate change in price growth**, indicating more emphasis on margin compression than on raising customer prices. [National Summary; Richmond, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n\n**Retail / Consumer\u2011facing sectors**\n- Mixed strategies: some firms **passed through** tariff costs quickly, while others\u2014especially where demand was soft or competition intense\u2014became **cautious about raising prices**, opting to **protect volume** and relationships. [Kansas City > Consumer Spending; National Summary, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n\n**Upstream / foreign producers**\n- In specific supply chains, **foreign and upstream suppliers absorbed a share of tariff costs**, moderating the price shocks faced by downstream U.S. firms and consumers. [BeigeBook_20251015, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n\n---\n## 5. Key comparative takeaways\n\n- **Manufacturing vs. Services:** Manufacturing firms **more frequently and visibly raised prices** in response to tariff\u2011induced cost increases, while service firms showed **smaller, slower, and more incomplete pass\u2011through**, absorbing more in margins. [Dallas; Richmond; Minneapolis; National Summary, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n- **Goods\u2011producing vs. consumer\u2011facing retail:** Both raised prices, but **manufacturers\u2019 price hikes were more clearly tied to tariffs** in the reports, whereas retailers showed more **heterogeneous, demand\u2011sensitive behavior**, with some firms becoming cautious about passing costs through. [Dallas; Minneapolis; Kansas City; National Summary, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n- **Within sectors, significant variation:** Even in manufacturing and retail, **not all firms fully passed through costs**. Richmond specifically documents **partial pass\u2011through**, and the National Summary emphasizes **variation across Districts and firms**, rather than any universal full pass\u2011through. [Richmond > Prices; National Summary > Prices, 2025\u201110\u201115]\n- **Role of foreign/upstream suppliers:** In certain import\u2011intensive industries, **foreign suppliers\u2019 willingness to absorb part of the tariff** dampened how aggressively downstream firms needed to raise prices.\n\nOverall, tariff\u2011induced cost shocks led to **stronger, more frequent price increases in manufacturing (and many goods\u2011oriented firms) than in services**, but **no sector exhibited uniform, full pass\u2011through**. Pricing strategies reflected a balance between recovering higher costs and preserving demand, with that balance differing systematically across sectors and even within them.",

      "question": "What was the relationship between federal policy and electric vehicle sales, and how did this affect overall auto sales?",
      "expected": "Auto sales were boosted in some districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September. However, in the Chicago District, light vehicle sales declined overall, especially for EVs following the end of federal tax credits. This shows the federal tax credit created a pre-expiration demand surge followed by a post-expiration decline.",
      "predicted": "Federal policy affected electric vehicle (EV) sales and overall auto sales through a clear chain of cause and effect:\n\n1. **Federal policy change \u2192 incentive to buy EVs sooner**  \n   - The federal EV tax credit was scheduled to expire at the end of September.  \n   - This created a deadline for consumers to qualify for the credit.  \n   - **This was caused by** federal policy design: the tax credit was time\u2011limited and its expiration date was known in advance.  \n   - **As a result**, consumers had a strong financial incentive to purchase EVs before the credit ended.\n\n2. **Impending expiration \u2192 surge in EV demand and sales**  \n   - Across multiple Federal Reserve Districts (Philadelphia, Boston/First District, Atlanta, Chicago, and in the national summary), dealers reported a **\u201crush,\u201d \u201crobust surge,\u201d or \u201cstrong demand\u201d** for EVs just before the end\u2011September expiration of the federal (and some state) tax credits. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - **This was caused by** consumers pulling purchases forward to capture the tax benefit before it disappeared.  \n   - **As a result**, EV sales temporarily spiked above what underlying demand alone would have produced.\n\n3. **Higher EV sales \u2192 support for overall auto sales levels**  \n   - In Philadelphia and the First District, contacts explicitly said that **overall auto sales would have fallen more sharply** without the last\u2011minute uptick in EV purchases. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - In Atlanta and New Hampshire, a **robust surge in EV sales directly drove modest increases or surges in total auto sales** before the credits expired. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - Nationally and in Chicago, reports noted that strong EV demand, supported by tax incentives, **kept new light\u2011vehicle sales brisk even as broader consumer spending softened.** [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n   - **This was caused by** EVs making up a growing share of new vehicle purchases; when EV sales rose, they materially lifted the total number of vehicles sold.  \n   - **As a result**, overall auto sales were either:  \n     - modestly increased, or  \n     - prevented from declining as much as they otherwise would have.\n\n4. **Overall causal chain**  \n   - **Federal EV tax credit and its scheduled end** \u2192 created a strong, time\u2011limited financial incentive.  \n   - **This was caused by** federal policy decisions about how to structure EV subsidies.  \n   - **As a result**, consumers **pulled forward** EV purchases into the period before expiration.  \n   - **This surge in EV sales** \u2192 either lifted total auto sales or cushioned them against broader weakness in demand.  \n   - **As a result**, the observed pattern in the data is that federal policy did not just affect the EV segment; it indirectly shaped the trajectory of **overall auto sales** by concentrating EV purchases in the pre\u2011expiration window.\n\nIn summary, federal policy (the EV tax credit and its impending expiration) **caused** a temporary spike in EV sales, which **in turn caused** overall auto sales to be higher\u2014or to fall less\u2014than they otherwise would have been in that period.",

      "question": "What were the multiple factors affecting labor costs, and how did they interact with wage growth?",
      "expected": "Wages grew at a modest to moderate pace across all districts. However, labor cost pressures intensified due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses. Additionally, some contacts in the Chicago District reported moderate increases in nonlabor costs including energy and higher prices for raw materials. This meant total compensation costs were rising faster than wage growth alone would suggest.",
      "predicted": "Labor costs were influenced by several interacting forces, and these forces largely *kept wage growth modest* rather than allowing a strong acceleration. The main cause\u2011and\u2011effect channels were:\n\n1. **Waning labor demand \u2192 Less need to raise wages \u2192 Subdued labor\u2011cost growth**\n- In the Kansas City District, wage growth was \u201ccurrently subdued **due to waning growth in labor demand**.\u201d This was caused by softer demand for workers, including small employment declines in some service sectors and headwinds in construction. As a result, firms there had little reason to bid up pay, and overall labor costs rose only slowly.\n- Nationally, the Beige Book noted that **demand for labor was generally muted** and that employment levels were \u201clargely stable\u201d across Districts. This was caused by slower overall economic momentum, which reduced hiring plans. As a result, wage pressures stayed contained, and total labor costs did not surge.\n\n2. **Increased labor supply (including former federal workers) \u2192 More competition for jobs \u2192 Wage growth held down**\n- The Kansas City Fed reported that \u201c**the availability of former federal workers in many local markets contributed to keeping wage growth subdued**.\u201d This was caused by those workers entering or re\u2011entering the job market after leaving federal employment, effectively increasing the pool of available labor.\n- Because firms could fill vacancies more easily from this larger labor pool, they did **not** have to offer significantly higher wages to attract staff. As a result, wage growth\u2014and therefore labor\u2011cost growth\u2014remained restrained despite only a small fall in employment.\n- In New York, \u201clabor supply continued to exceed labor demand,\u201d and \u201cit has been consistently easier to find workers.\u201d This excess supply again reduced the need to raise pay. As a result, the New York Fed reported that **wage growth remained modest**, keeping overall labor\u2011cost increases modest as well.\n\n3. **Low turnover and easy hiring \u2192 Lower recruitment/training pressure \u2192 Modest wage increases and stable labor costs**\n- In Philadelphia, business contacts reported **low employee turnover** and \u201clittle trouble hiring workers.\u201d This was caused by a relatively balanced labor market in which employees were not frequently switching jobs and firms could staff positions without intense competition.\n- Because firms were not struggling to retain or recruit workers, they could continue offering only **modest, pre\u2011pandemic\u2011like wage increases**. As a result, wages in the Philadelphia District \u201cagain rose at modest pre\u2011pandemic rates,\u201d and labor costs increased only gradually.\n- Extremely low turnover also meant fewer replacement hires and less frequent onboarding. As a result, recruitment and training components of labor costs likely stayed contained, reinforcing the effect of modest wage growth on total labor costs.\n\n4. **Stable or slightly changing headcounts \u2192 Limited expansion of the wage bill \u2192 Contained total labor costs**\n- In several Districts (Boston, Richmond, Philadelphia, and in the national summary), employment was described as **flat or only slightly higher**:\n  - Boston: \u201cEmployment was flat overall.\u201d\n  - Richmond: \u201cOn balance, employment \u2026 was unchanged.\u201d\n  - Philadelphia: \u201cEmployment levels increased slightly,\u201d and most firms reported little change in employee counts.\n- This stability in headcount was caused by muted hiring needs and some sectoral headwinds (e.g., slight reductions in consumer and business services and construction in Kansas City).\n- As a result, even where wages were rising modestly, the **total wage bill** (wage per worker \u00d7 number of workers) did not increase rapidly. This limited the pass\u2011through from wage growth into overall labor\u2011cost growth.\n\n5. **Sector\u2011specific weakness (services, construction) \u2192 Softer wage pressure where demand fell \u2192 Dampened contribution to labor costs**\n- In Kansas City, \u201cslight reductions in head counts at consumer and business service providers\u201d and \u201cheadwinds\u201d in construction reduced labor demand in those sectors.\n- This was caused by weaker demand for their output and increased uncertainty, which reduced hiring or prompted small cuts.\n- As a result, wage pressures in those sectors eased, and their contribution to aggregate labor\u2011cost growth declined. Any wage increases that did occur tended to be smaller, reinforcing the pattern of **subdued** wage growth at the District level.\n\n6. **District\u2011specific wage outcomes \u2192 Different but uniformly moderate contributions to labor costs**\nAcross districts, these demand and supply conditions produced slightly different, but consistently moderate, descriptions of wage growth:\n- **Kansas City:** Wage growth was **subdued**, caused by waning labor demand and additional supply from former federal workers. As a result, labor\u2011cost pressures were held down.\n- **New York:** Wage growth \u201cremained **modest**,\u201d caused by labor supply exceeding labor demand and easier hiring. As a result, labor costs rose slowly.\n- **Philadelphia:** Wages \u201cagain rose at **modest pre\u2011pandemic rates**,\u201d caused by slight employment gains, low turnover, and little hiring difficulty. As a result, total labor costs increased only gradually.\n- **Richmond:** Wage growth remained **moderate**, in a context where employment was flat on balance. This was caused by neither strong tightening nor loosening of labor markets. As a result, wage growth contributed to cost increases but did not accelerate.\n\n7. **Limited evidence on non\u2011wage cost surges \u2192 Wage dynamics as the primary documented driver**\n- Earlier interpretations suggested that employer health\u2011insurance costs, payroll taxes, or other benefits might be unusually large drivers of labor costs in this period. The specific Beige Book excerpts here **do not** document such patterns: they do not report outsized benefit cost increases, tariff\u2011driven layoffs tied directly to labor costs, or rising payroll\u2011tax burdens.\n- Because of this, there is no evidence in these excerpts that **non\u2011wage labor costs were independently surging** or amplifying wage increases. As a result, the main, documented interaction is between **wage dynamics, labor demand/supply, turnover, and headcounts**, not between wages and sharply rising benefits or taxes.\n\n8. **Net interaction: Why total labor costs rose only modestly**\nPutting the channels together:\n- **Muted labor demand**, **increased labor supply** (including former federal workers), **low turnover**, and **stable headcounts** all reduced firms\u2019 need to raise wages aggressively.\n- This was caused by softer economic conditions and ample availability of workers in several Districts.\n- As a result, wage growth was generally described as **modest, subdued, or moderate**, and firms did not face strong wage\u2011driven cost shocks.\n- Because headcounts were mostly flat and recruitment/training pressures were limited, **total labor costs**\u2014driven by wages, number of workers, and turnover\u2011related expenses\u2014rose only gradually.\n\nThus, the multiple factors affecting labor costs interacted in a largely reinforcing way: cooler demand, ample supply, and low turnover all **caused wage growth to remain contained**, and that, in turn, **kept overall labor\u2011cost increases moderate** rather than allowing the kind of rapid cost escalation that would occur in a very tight labor market.\n",

      "question": "How did consumer spending patterns affect different restaurant segments in the Chicago District?",
      "expected": "In the Chicago District, leisure and hospitality sales were mixed, with softness in some travel-related categories including airlines and hotels, but increased spending at restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments. Demand from restaurant groups remained solid, as indicated by commercial real estate leasing activity.",
      "predicted": "Modest overall consumer spending growth in the Chicago (Seventh) District caused **disproportionately strong gains for certain restaurant segments**, particularly value- and convenience-oriented formats.\n\n1. **Overall consumer spending \u2192 Higher spending at specific restaurant types**  \n   - Consumer spending in the district showed **only modest overall gains**.  \n   - **This was caused by** generally steady but not booming household spending across categories in the period.  \n   - **As a result**, the restaurant sector did not just grow uniformly; instead, the modest overall gains **translated into notably higher spending at three specific segments**:\n     - **Fast food (quick service)**  \n     - **Fast casual**  \n     - **Family dining**  \n   - These segments **\u201cexperienced increased consumer spending during the reporting period,\u201d** which implies more customer traffic, higher average checks, or both in these formats. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. **Shift toward value and convenience \u2192 Stronger performance for fast food, fast casual, and family dining**  \n   - Households facing only modest income/spending growth tend to prioritize **value, affordability, and convenience** when eating out.  \n   - **This was caused by** consumers looking for lower price points or better value propositions rather than high\u2011end, discretionary dining.  \n   - **As a result**, spending **concentrated in**:\n     - **Fast food/quick service**, which offers low prices and speed.  \n     - **Fast casual**, which combines relatively moderate prices with perceived quality.  \n     - **Family dining**, which often provides budget\u2011friendly full\u2011service meals suitable for groups.  \n   - These formats thus captured a **larger share of restaurant dollars** within the Chicago District during the period, even though total consumer spending was only modestly higher. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n3. **Segment\u2011specific spending gains \u2192 Solid demand for restaurant real estate**  \n   - Because fast food, fast casual, and family dining operators were seeing stronger sales, many had the confidence and cash flow to consider growth or maintain footprints.  \n   - **This was caused by** the increased consumer spending in those segments, which supported operators\u2019 willingness to invest and expand.  \n   - **As a result**, the Beige Book reports that **\u201cdemand from restaurant groups for commercial space remained solid\u201d** in the Chicago District.  \n     - Even though the report does not name particular brands or locations, the solid real\u2011estate demand is **directly linked** to the healthier sales performance in these restaurant segments. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n4. **Information limits on other segments (fine dining/luxury)**  \n   - The Chicago section **does not report** on fine dining or luxury restaurant performance at all.  \n   - **This absence is caused by** the fact that the cited Beige Book passage for Chicago only highlights fast food, fast casual, and family dining; any mention of luxury and quick service together comes from **another district (Richmond), not Chicago.**  \n   - **As a result**, we **cannot causally link** Chicago consumer spending patterns to outcomes for luxury/fine\u2011dining or higher\u2011end casual sit\u2011down restaurants from this source alone; their gains or losses in Chicago remain unknown based on the available evidence. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nIn summary, modest overall consumer spending growth in the Chicago District **caused a targeted boost in restaurant spending**, especially in **fast food, fast casual, and family dining** segments. **As a result**, these segments saw stronger revenues and helped **drive solid, ongoing demand for restaurant commercial space**, while the impact on fine dining or luxury restaurants in Chicago cannot be determined from the report.",

      "question": "How did lower interest rates affect different interest rate-sensitive sectors across districts?",
      "expected": "Lower interest rates had positive effects across multiple sectors: In Cleveland, commercial construction and financial services saw uptick in demand due to lower rates. In Chicago, financial conditions loosened modestly with business loan volumes increasing. However, the impact was mixed - while some reports noted improved business lending, residential real estate remained weak in Dallas and home sales were flat in Boston. The housing market's response to lower rates was more muted than commercial sectors.",
      "predicted": "Lower interest rates affected interest\u2011rate\u2011sensitive sectors in **causal**, but **uneven**, ways across Districts.\n\n1. Cheaper borrowing costs \u2192 modest pickup in some business lending and commercial real estate\n- **Cause:** Policy rates moved lower, reducing borrowing costs.\n- **Effects:**\n  - **Business lending nationally:** The Beige Book notes that \u201csome reports\u201d saw **improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates**. This was caused by firms responding to cheaper credit by taking out more commercial loans, but the wording (\u201csome reports,\u201d \u201cimproved\u201d) shows the effect was **modest and not universal** across Districts. [Evidence 4]\n  - **Boston (First District) \u2013 commercial real estate:** Overall activity \u201cticked up,\u201d and **commercial real estate activity increased slightly**. This was likely supported by lower financing costs, which made commercial projects and transactions somewhat more attractive, causing a **slight** increase rather than a surge. [Evidence 9]\n  - **Dallas \u2013 commercial real estate:** The **Dallas District** reported that commercial real estate activity **improved**. This improvement was consistent with lower interest rates making it easier or cheaper to finance commercial property purchases or refinancings, causing a modest strengthening in that rate\u2011sensitive sector. [Evidence 5]\n\n2. Lower rates \u2192 stronger response in some Districts (Cleveland) but not others (San Francisco, New York)\n- **Cleveland District \u2013 clear positive response:**\n  - **Cause:** Lower interest rates and expectations of further cuts.\n  - **Effects:** Contacts reported that interest\u2011rate\u2011sensitive sectors such as **commercial construction and bank lending** strengthened. Bankers saw **moderately higher loan demand from both households and businesses** and even **expected a sharp further increase** as additional rate cuts were anticipated. Lower rates directly reduced loan costs, causing borrowers in this District to step up both construction and credit demand. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **San Francisco District \u2013 limited response:**\n  - **Cause:** The same lower\u2011rate environment applied, but local conditions constrained the response.\n  - **Effects:** Lending activity there was reported as **largely steady**, with only **emerging additional loan demand**. This means lower rates had begun to prompt more borrowing, but local businesses and households were slower to respond, so the immediate effect was **small and just beginning to show up** rather than a clear boost. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n- **New York District \u2013 negative loan demand despite lower rates:**\n  - **Cause:** Even with cheaper credit, other forces (e.g., weaker demand, risk aversion, or regional conditions) dominated.\n  - **Effects:** The **New York District reported declining overall loan demand**. Here, lower rates did **not** prevent a fall in credit activity; instead, non\u2011rate factors caused borrowers to pull back, more than offsetting the incentive provided by cheaper borrowing. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n3. Lower rates \u2192 mixed effects in real estate; housing often more responsive than commercial, but not uniformly\n- **Nationally \u2013 real estate as rate\u2011sensitive, but muted in many places:**\n  - **Cause:** Declining rates should support both **residential and commercial real estate** by lowering mortgage and financing costs.\n  - **Effects:** The Beige Book identifies residential and commercial real estate as key **interest\u2011rate\u2011sensitive sectors**, but notes that conditions in these sectors were **mixed** and that some remained **muted despite lower interest rates**. This means that while lower rates *could* have stimulated sales and construction, in many Districts other headwinds (like affordability problems, supply constraints, or weak demand) caused real\u2011estate activity to stay subdued. [Evidence 1, 2, 4]\n- **San Francisco District \u2013 housing moved, commercial did not:**\n  - **Cause:** Lower interest rates interacted with local housing and commercial property fundamentals.\n  - **Effects:** In the San Francisco District, **housing (residential) activity decreased somewhat** while **commercial real estate was unchanged**. Under the same lower\u2011rate environment, residential activity fell but commercial held steady. This pattern is **consistent with** housing being more immediately affected by other negative forces (e.g., affordability issues or weak buyer confidence) that outweighed the benefit of lower rates, causing a decline; commercial property, facing different dynamics, neither improved nor deteriorated. The Beige Book does not explicitly say this is \u201cbecause of\u201d interest rates, so this is a cautious interpretation rather than a stated causal finding.\n\n4. Lower rates \u2192 financial services remain muted in many places\n- **Cause:** Lower rates normally stimulate **financial services** (banking, lending, related activities) because they encourage borrowing and refinancing.\n- **Effects:** The national summary states that **financial services is itself an interest\u2011rate\u2011sensitive sector**, yet \u201csome reports continued to highlight **muted activity levels in the financial services sector despite lower interest rates**,\u201d and that conditions in financial services were **mixed across Federal Reserve Districts**. This means that, in some areas, even though lower rates should have boosted loan originations and deal activity, other factors (such as tight credit standards, risk concerns, or weak demand) caused financial\u2011services activity to remain subdued. The specific Districts with muted financial\u2011services activity are not named in the excerpts we have. [Evidence 2, 5, 7]\n\n5. Overall across Districts: lower rates \u2192 modest, uneven support, not a broad surge\n- **Cause:** A uniform national easing in interest rates.\n- **Aggregate effects:**\n  - The national summary reports that \u201cconditions in interest rate\u2011sensitive sectors were **mixed across Federal Reserve Districts**\u201d and that overall economic activity \u201c**changed little on balance**,\u201d with three Districts seeing slight to modest growth, five no change, and four a slight softening. [Evidence 1, 4, 8, 9]\n  - This was caused by the fact that, although lower rates **did** make borrowing cheaper and **did** modestly support some segments\u2014especially **business lending** in some areas and **commercial real estate** in Boston, Dallas, and Cleveland\u2014other forces (regional demand conditions, credit standards, structural issues in housing, or risk aversion) often counteracted these rate effects.\n  - As a result, the response of interest\u2011rate\u2011sensitive sectors was **not broad\u2011based**: some Districts (like **Cleveland**) experienced a clear pickup in credit and construction, some (like **San Francisco**) saw only tentative or emerging gains, while others (like **New York**) actually reported weakening loan demand despite lower rates.\n\n6. Important limitations and clarifications\n- The evidence explicitly documents:\n  - **Improved business lending** in some Districts due to lower rates. [Evidence 4]\n  - **Slightly stronger commercial real estate** in Boston and improved conditions in Dallas. [Evidence 5, 9]\n  - **Cleveland\u2019s** stronger response in commercial construction and bank lending, and **San Francisco\u2019s** mostly steady lending with only emerging demand, alongside **New York\u2019s** declining loan demand. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  - **Financial services** as a rate\u2011sensitive sector that often remained **muted** despite lower rates. [Evidence 2, 5, 7]\n- The excerpts **do not** clearly document:\n  - A broad, explicit increase in **household lending** (such as mortgages or consumer credit) across many Districts.\n  - District\u2011by\u2011District attribution of which specific interest\u2011sensitive sectors were muted or improving, beyond the few Districts named above.\n\nIn sum, lower interest rates **caused** some easing in borrowing costs that **led to** modest gains in business lending, commercial construction, and commercial real estate in a few Districts (notably Cleveland, Boston, and Dallas). However, other factors often **caused** loan demand, housing, and financial\u2011services activity to remain muted or even weaken (as in New York and parts of San Francisco), so the net effect across interest\u2011rate\u2011sensitive sectors and across Districts was **mixed and generally modest rather than strong and uniform**.",

      "question": "How did federal funding changes affect employment in specific sectors?",
      "expected": "Federal funding changes negatively impacted employment across multiple sectors: In Boston, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in education and health-care sectors. In Cleveland, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to federal grant uncertainty. In New York, nonprofits faced challenges from reduced federal benefit programs, with community health-care centers reporting financial strain. Manufacturing employment in Boston was mixed, with one firm shedding workers to offset tariff-related cost increases.",
      "predicted": "Federal funding changes affected employment mainly by tightening labor demand in specific, funding\u2011dependent sectors. The Beige Book evidence is mostly qualitative, but it does support several clear cause\u2011and\u2011effect chains.\n\n---\n### 1. Health care: grant cuts \u2192 layoffs\n\n- **Cause:** In the Boston Federal Reserve District, **cuts to federal grant funding** for health\u2011care providers and services.\n- **Effect:** **Layoffs in the health\u2011care sector.** The Boston Fed explicitly reports that \u201ccuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the health\u2011care sector.\u201d This was caused by providers losing a revenue stream they relied on, forcing them to reduce payroll to balance budgets. \n- **Broader context:** In Boston overall, employment was flat but **layoffs became more common even as total employment remained unchanged**, showing that grant\u2011driven layoffs in health care occurred within a wider pattern of rising layoff activity.\n\nOther districts show health\u2011care job reductions but **without a documented causal link to federal funding**:\n- **New York:** Health\u2011care firms saw \u201cfairly significant declines in head counts,\u201d but this was **not explicitly attributed** to federal funding changes.\n- **San Francisco:** Health\u2011care employers reported staff reductions via **attrition, layoffs, and early retirements**; again, the evidence **does not link** these cuts specifically to federal funding.\n\nSo, the **only clearly causal chain** we can state is:\n> Federal grant cuts (Boston health care) \u2192 reduced revenue \u2192 layoffs among health\u2011care providers.\n\n---\n### 2. Nonprofits and social\u2011service organizations: funding uncertainty \u2192 hiring restraint and head\u2011count cuts\n\nAcross several districts, nonprofits are portrayed as highly sensitive to federal funding and benefit programs.\n\n**a. Uncertainty or reductions in federal grants \u2192 unfilled vacancies and smaller organizations**\n\n- **Cause:** Decreases and, especially, **uncertainty around federal grant funding**, along with **unpredictable funding and reductions in federal benefit programs**.\n- **Effects:**\n  - **Not filling open positions:** A nonprofit respondent in a Federal Reserve district survey (previously attributed to Cleveland) reported that **\u201cthe nonprofit sector was not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants.\u201d** This was caused by organizations\u2019 fear that promised or expected federal money might not materialize, making them reluctant to commit to new payroll costs.\n  - **Trimmed head counts:** In the **Dallas** district, nonprofits \u201c**trimmed head counts**,\u201d indicating they actively reduced staff. This appears as a response to financial and economic uncertainty; the text suggests funding conditions as a headwind but does not always isolate federal dollars as the sole cause.\n  - **Planning to be smaller:** In the **Chicago** district (from the broader evidence base), nonprofit and community contacts anticipated operating with **smaller budgets** in the coming year, which implies future staffing restraint. This was caused by expectations of tighter or less reliable funding, including public grants.\n  - **Using reserve funds for operations:** In the **Cleveland** district survey, at least one nonprofit had to **tap its reserve fund for operating expenses for the first time in more than ten years**, a sign of acute funding stress. This pushed organizations to become more cautious about hiring.\n\n**b. Reduced federal benefits and unpredictable funding \u2192 operational strain, not always directly quantified in jobs**\n\n- **New York:** Many nonprofits and at least one **community health\u2011care center** reported that **unpredictable funding and reductions in federal benefit programs** (e.g., affecting Medicaid patients) increased financial distress among clients and strained service providers. As a result, nonprofits faced pressure to do more with constrained resources, which discouraged new hiring and likely limited staff expansion, though specific job numbers are not given.\n- **St. Louis:** Nonprofits saw **growing demand for services** while operating under funding pressure. This was caused by rising community need combined with constrained or uncertain funding, encouraging them to stretch existing staff instead of adding workers.\n\nOverall nonprofit cause\u2013effect chain:\n> Decreased or uncertain federal grants / reduced federal benefits \u2192 higher financial strain and budget risk \u2192 nonprofits delay hiring, do not fill vacancies, and in some cases trim head counts or plan to be smaller.\n\nThe Beige Book does **not** provide numerical job losses for nonprofits; the evidence is directional and qualitative.\n\n---\n### 3. Construction and real estate: federal\u2011funding uncertainty \u2192 slowed projects \u2192 weaker labor demand\n\nThe clearest link here is in **nonresidential construction and related real estate** in the **Philadelphia** district.\n\n- **Cause:** **Uncertainty about the status of federal funding** for certain projects.\n- **Effect:**\n  - A Philadelphia contact reported that **\u201cuncertainty surrounding the status of federal funding was slowing previously planned projects.\u201d** This was caused by clients or developers hesitating to proceed until they knew whether federal funds would be available.\n  - As a result, **nonresidential construction activity, already slightly declining, faced additional headwinds**, implying weaker labor demand for construction workers and related real estate and development jobs in that region.\n\nWhile the report does **not** name the specific projects or count affected jobs, the causal chain is clear:\n> Federal\u2011funding status uncertain \u2192 planned nonresidential projects delayed or slowed \u2192 reduced or delayed construction work \u2192 weaker or deferred hiring in construction and related real estate.\n\nOther construction references:\n- **Kansas City** district contacts mentioned headwinds and some reductions in construction employment, but the evidence attributes these mainly to softer demand and profitability concerns, **not explicitly to federal funding**.\n\n---\n### 4. Manufacturing and other private services: staff reductions mainly from demand and general uncertainty, not clearly from federal funding\n\n**Manufacturing**\n\n- In **San Francisco**, contacts in manufacturing reported that staff levels were reduced through **attrition, layoffs, and early retirements**. This was caused by firm\u2011specific conditions and broader uncertainty, but **no direct link** to changes in federal funding or grants is stated.\n- In **Boston**, manufacturing employment was \u201cunchanged on balance\u201d; some firms added workers, some held headcounts steady because of **uncertainty**, and at least one shed workers due to **weaker demand**. Again, this weaker demand is **not tied explicitly** to federal funding decisions.\n\nThus, for manufacturing the Beige Book supports:\n> Softer product demand / general economic uncertainty \u2192 selective layoffs, attrition, and early retirements in manufacturing.\n\nBut it **does not show**:\n> Federal funding cuts \u2192 manufacturing layoffs.\n\n**Consumer and business services, retail, and other sectors**\n\n- In the **Kansas City** district, some consumer and business service providers planned **modest layoffs to \u201cright\u2011size\u201d staffing** amid softer demand and to maintain profitability. This was caused by weaker private\u2011sector demand rather than any documented federal funding shift.\n- In the **New York** district, **retail** firms reported \u201cfairly significant declines in head counts,\u201d and **education and health care** plus **construction** underperformed other sectors. However, no explicit causal link ties these head\u2011count declines to federal budget changes; they appear as sectoral softness driven by demand conditions.\n\nSo the main chain here is:\n> Softer sectoral demand / profitability concerns \u2192 right\u2011sizing layoffs and staff reductions (services, retail, some construction and manufacturing), with **no clear evidence** that federal funding changes were the primary driver.\n\n---\n### 5. Overall patterns and limits of the evidence\n\nAcross the Beige Book passages, the employment impact of federal funding changes shows up through a few distinct mechanisms:\n\n1. **Direct funding cuts \u2192 direct layoffs**\n   - Boston health\u2011care sector: federal grant cuts **caused** layoffs.\n\n2. **Funding uncertainty \u2192 hiring freezes and project delays**\n   - Nonprofits in several districts: uncertainty about federal grants \u2192 **not filling open positions** and, in some cases, **trimming head counts**.\n   - Philadelphia nonresidential construction: uncertainty about federal funds \u2192 **slowed or delayed projects** \u2192 weaker labor demand.\n\n3. **Reduced or unpredictable federal benefits \u2192 operational strain that suppresses hiring**\n   - Nonprofits and a community health\u2011care center in New York: reductions in federal benefit programs and unpredictable funding \u2192 greater client need and fiscal strain \u2192 pressure to limit hiring or operate leaner.\n\nAt the same time, the evidence has clear **limitations**:\n- **No numerical job counts** are provided for any sector; all impacts are described qualitatively (e.g., \u201ctrimmed head counts,\u201d \u201clayoffs,\u201d \u201cnot filling open positions\u201d).\n- Some sectors with reported job losses (manufacturing, retail, parts of education and construction) are **not explicitly linked** to federal funding changes; their job cuts appear driven by demand and general uncertainty.\n- For nonprofits, we know funding uncertainty and reduced grants **constrained hiring** and sometimes reduced staffing, but we often lack district\u2011by\u2011district breakdowns or specific organization names.\n\nWithin those limits, the clearest causal relationships are:\n- **Federal grant cuts** \u2192 **health\u2011care layoffs** (Boston).\n- **Federal grant/funding uncertainty** \u2192 **nonprofit hiring freezes and occasional head\u2011count cuts** (multiple districts).\n- **Uncertainty about federal funding for projects** \u2192 **slower nonresidential construction and related real\u2011estate work**, thereby weakening construction\u2011sector labor demand (Philadelphia).",

      "expected": "Multiple factors contributed to uncertainty: Tariff policy changes made planning difficult for manufacturers (noted in Chicago and across districts). Federal grant uncertainty affected nonprofits (Cleveland, New York, Boston). Policy uncertainty was a top business concern (Dallas). Immigration policy changes created labor supply concerns (St. Louis, Boston). The potential for government shutdown was highlighted as a downside risk. Kansas City noted that despite current decline, 2026 expectations remained optimistic.",
      "predicted": "Economic uncertainty across districts arose from several distinct but related causes, with clear cause\u2011and\u2011effect channels:\n\n1. Policy and macroeconomic risks\n\n- Dallas District \u2013 policy and inflation concerns\n  - Businesses in Dallas \u201chighlighted policy uncertainty as a top concern,\u201d and also cited inflation and slowing demand as top concerns. This was caused by domestic policy questions and elevated price pressures, which made firms unsure about future costs and regulations. As a result, manufacturers reported that \u201cdomestic policy uncertainty continued to weigh on manufacturing outlooks,\u201d and uncertainty remained a headwind for the nonfinancial service sector, where activity had already \u201ccontracted slightly.\u201d This led firms to be cautious about investment and growth plans. [BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary > Dallas; Dallas > Manufacturing; Dallas > Nonfinancial Services]\n\n- New York District \u2013 trade policy and tariffs\n  - In New York, \u201cuncertainty relating to tariffs continued to weigh on manufacturers.\u201d This was caused by unresolved trade policy and tariff regimes that directly affect input costs and export demand. As a result, manufacturers of electrical equipment, machinery, and instruments faced weaker confidence in their future orders and profitability, contributing to broader economic uncertainty in the district. [New York > Manufacturing and Distribution]\n\n- Kansas City (Tenth District) \u2013 energy-sector investment risk\n  - In the Kansas City energy sector, \u201cmany Tenth District firms cited heightened uncertainty as a headwind for investment.\u201d This was caused by volatility in energy prices and uncertainty about future regulation and regional economic conditions. As a result, oil and gas firms delayed or scaled back capital spending, which dampened activity in the broader regional energy supply chain. [Kansas City > Energy]\n\n- Philadelphia District \u2013 federal funding and general uncertainty\n  - Firms in the Philadelphia District \u201cface heightened economic uncertainty.\u201d Part of this was caused by uncertainty over the status of federal funding, which one contact said was slowing previously planned construction projects. As a result, some investments and projects were postponed, reinforcing a cautious stance among firms more generally. [National Summary > Philadelphia]\n\n- Boston and Chicago \u2013 broad economic-condition uncertainty\n  - Contacts in Boston and Chicago described elevated or ongoing uncertainty around economic conditions, especially among manufacturing, retail, tourism, and community organizations. This was caused by a mix of unclear demand prospects and broader macro risks, though specific policy triggers were not always identified. As a result, firms in these sectors were more hesitant to expand capacity or take on new commitments. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n2. Demand-side uncertainty and consumer behavior\n\n- Minneapolis District \u2013 consumer caution and softer discretionary spending\n  - In Minneapolis, \u201cconsumer spending was slightly lower,\u201d and \u201cretail, hospitality, and tourism firms reported lower foot traffic, revenue, and profits relative to a year ago\u201d and expected these trends to persist. This was caused by consumers \u201cexhibiting caution and value-seeking behavior\u201d and \u201ccutting back on nonnecessities, including vacations.\u201d As a result, firms in retail, hospitality, and tourism faced weaker demand, rising margin pressure, and greater uncertainty about near-term sales and staffing needs. [Minneapolis > Consumer Spending; Minneapolis > Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprises]\n\n- Dallas District \u2013 slowing demand\n  - Dallas contacts also cited \u201cslowing demand\u201d as a top concern. This was caused by softer orders and weaker consumer and business spending. As a result, uncertainty about future revenues increased, especially in nonfinancial services, where leisure and hospitality \u201cexhibited weakness,\u201d adding to firms\u2019 caution about expansion. [National Summary > Dallas; Dallas > Nonfinancial Services]\n\n3. Labor-market and hiring uncertainty\n\n- Atlanta District \u2013 uncertain demand and labor supply\n  - In Atlanta, \u201cuncertainty around consumer demand in the District continued to weigh on firms\u2019 hiring plans,\u201d and \u201cuncertainty around labor supply in the District continued to weigh on firms\u2019 hiring plans.\u201d This was caused by firms not knowing whether future sales would justify new positions, and by concerns about whether they could even fill those positions. As a result, firms reported a \u201chiring chill,\u201d welcomed attrition, and made fewer headcount additions, which in turn reinforced slower employment growth and contributed to broader economic uncertainty. [Atlanta > Labor Markets]\n\n- Boston District \u2013 hiring held steady because of uncertainty\n  - In Boston manufacturing, \u201csome firms kept head counts steady because of uncertainty.\u201d This was caused by unclear outlooks for orders and costs, which made firms reluctant to expand payrolls. As a result, hiring plans remained limited even where business conditions had not yet deteriorated sharply, dampening local labor-market momentum. [Boston > Labor Markets]\n\n4. Sector-specific and regional factors\n\n- Manufacturing (Dallas, New York, Boston)\n  - Dallas: \u201cDomestic policy uncertainty continued to weigh on manufacturing outlooks,\u201d as firms faced unclear regulations and macro conditions. As a result, they reported slower output growth and softer new orders, particularly in some durable goods segments. [Dallas > Manufacturing]\n  - New York: Tariff uncertainty directly affected manufacturers\u2019 cost structures and export markets. As a result, producers of electrical equipment, machinery, and instruments experienced heightened concern about future profitability and investment. [New York > Manufacturing and Distribution]\n  - Boston: Manufacturing firms chose to keep headcounts steady \u201cbecause of uncertainty,\u201d signifying that unclear demand and cost trajectories translated into restrained hiring and capital decisions. [Boston > Labor Markets]\n\n- Nonfinancial services and tourism (Dallas, Minneapolis, Chicago)\n  - Dallas: \u201cActivity in nonfinancial services contracted slightly,\u201d and \u201cuncertainty remained a headwind for the service sector,\u201d with notable weakness in health care, information, and leisure and hospitality. This was caused by a combination of policy concerns, inflation, and slowing demand. As a result, service firms curtailed expansion and became more guarded about future hiring and investment. [Dallas > Nonfinancial Services]\n  - Minneapolis: Cautious, value\u2011seeking consumers reduced spending on vacations and other nonessential services. As a result, tourism and hospitality firms reported lower traffic, revenues, and profits and anticipated continued strain, heightening uncertainty about their viability and staffing levels. [Minneapolis > Consumer Spending]\n  - Chicago: Community organizations and tourism-related sectors reported elevated uncertainty around economic conditions. This was caused by inconsistent demand and funding expectations, which made planning difficult. As a result, these organizations remained conservative in budgeting and program expansion. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n5. Investment and construction decisions\n\n- Kansas City energy \u2013 delayed capital spending\n  - Heightened uncertainty was \u201ca headwind for investment\u201d among Tenth District energy firms. This was caused by unclear future price and policy paths. As a result, exploration and development projects were postponed or scaled down, slowing associated employment and supplier activity. [Kansas City > Energy]\n\n- Philadelphia construction \u2013 funding-related delays\n  - In Philadelphia, uncertainty over federal funding status led at least one contact to slow previously planned construction projects. This was caused by doubts about whether committed public funds would materialize. As a result, construction timelines stretched, and related hiring and materials purchases were pushed back, amplifying local economic uncertainty. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nSummary cause\u2011effect pattern across districts:\n- Policy and regulatory uncertainty (Dallas, New York, Philadelphia, Kansas City) caused firms to delay investment, moderate hiring, and report weaker outlooks.\n- Softer and less predictable demand (Minneapolis, Dallas, Atlanta) caused reduced consumer and business spending, which in turn led to lower revenues, margin pressure, and more cautious hiring and expansion.\n- Labor-market uncertainty (Atlanta, Boston) caused firms to freeze or slow hiring, maintaining headcounts rather than expanding.\n- Sector\u2011specific shocks (manufacturing, services, energy, tourism) caused localized pullbacks in output, employment, and investment, feeding into broader district\u2011level economic uncertainty.\n\nWhere the Beige Book excerpts are silent (e.g., on government shutdown risk, food pantry usage, or a broad shift to temporary staffing), the underlying drivers of uncertainty cannot be tied to specific districts based on the current evidence, so those remain general national concerns rather than documented district\u2011level causes in this report.\n",

      "question": "What supply chain disruptions affected manufacturing, and how did they impact production?",
      "expected": "Supply chain challenges varied across districts. In San Francisco, manufacturers noted higher costs for utilities and imported semiconductor chips. In Chicago, manufacturing demand declined modestly with fabricated metals demand unchanged on balance as higher sales to some sectors were offset by lower sales to construction and automotive industries. Tariff-induced input cost increases affected manufacturing across many districts, with firms reporting difficulty planning due to changing tariff policies. Labor shortages due to immigration policy changes also constrained production in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture sectors.",
      "predicted": "Supply chain disruptions affected manufacturing mainly through three linked channels\u2014procurement delays/shortages, rising input costs (including tariffs), and related operational constraints. These causes led to specific production outcomes such as flat or weaker output, higher prices, and, in extreme cases, temporary shutdowns.\n\n1. Procurement delays and input shortages \u2192 Slower or constrained production\n- Manufacturers in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s district **had difficulty procuring equipment and materials** during the reporting period after a summer uptick in activity. This was caused by supply chain frictions in sourcing needed inputs. [Sub\u20111; Sub\u20112]\n- As a result, even though manufacturing had picked up earlier in the summer, **overall manufacturing activity was described as \u201clittle changed\u201d**, with **new orders down and shipments mostly unchanged**. The procurement challenges, together with weaker demand, limited further growth in output and likely contributed to production schedules being held back from expanding. [Sub\u20111; Sub\u20112]\n- More generally, the Beige Book notes that **difficulty securing equipment and materials can slow or delay production schedules**, because firms cannot fully utilize capacity when key inputs arrive late or in insufficient quantities. This was caused by disruptions in upstream supply availability and logistics. As a result, manufacturers face risks of late deliveries to customers and may be forced to prioritize or ration production among orders. [Sub\u20113]\n\n2. Rising input costs (materials, components, tariffs) \u2192 Higher production costs, margin pressure, and pricing/volume adjustments\n- In the New York district, manufacturers **faced elevated input prices**. This was caused by broad-based cost pressures in materials and components, including tariff-related increases. [Sub\u20111; Sub\u20112]\n  - As a result, their **cost structures rose**, squeezing margins. Combined with softening new orders, this likely discouraged aggressive expansion of production capacity or hiring, helping explain why overall activity remained \u201clittle changed\u201d after the summer uptick. [Sub\u20111]\n\n- In the Atlanta district, manufacturers **remained concerned about rising costs**, and in the Boston district **certain cost pressures intensified**. This was caused by higher prices for various inputs (materials, components, and other business expenses). [Sub\u20111; Sub\u20112]\n  - As a result, firms in these districts faced similar margin pressure and had to weigh whether to raise output prices, delay investments, or slow production growth, even if current output had not yet fallen sharply. [Sub\u20112]\n\n- In the San Francisco district, **input costs for imported semiconductor chips increased in recent weeks**. This was caused by higher prices for imported chips, likely tied to global supply chain and trade conditions. [Sub\u20112]\n  - As a result, manufacturers that rely on these chips (e.g., electronics and advanced equipment producers) saw **higher component costs**, which can force them either to raise final product prices, accept lower margins, redesign products to use alternative components, or scale back production plans if demand cannot absorb higher prices. [Sub\u20112]\n\n- Nationally, the Beige Book reports that **tariff-induced input cost increases occurred across many districts**, with **firms in the Philadelphia district specifically reporting increased cost pressures from tariffs and other business expenses**. This was caused by changes in trade policy and tariff schedules that made imported, and sometimes competing domestic, inputs more expensive. [Sub\u20112]\n  - As a result, manufacturers faced **broad-based increases in input costs**, and final prices **continued to rise moderately** in Philadelphia. Firms varied in how much of these costs they passed on; where they could not fully raise prices, higher costs likely constrained profits and reduced incentives to expand production. [Sub\u20112]\n\n3. Extreme cost spikes and logistical frictions \u2192 Acute production interruptions and shutdown risk\n- Across districts, higher materials costs\u2014especially for items such as steel\u2014**raised overall production costs** for manufacturers. This was caused by commodity price increases and tariff effects. [Sub\u20113]\n  - As a result, some firms faced not just tighter margins but **acute stress on individual product lines**, creating a risk of temporary stoppages when production at prevailing input costs was uneconomical.\n\n- One earlier account referenced an **upstate New York keg manufacturer that temporarily ceased production due to high steel prices**. The general pattern\u2014steel-intensive manufacturers facing elevated input prices in the New York district\u2014is supported (manufacturers there did face elevated input prices), but the specific case of this particular keg manufacturer and its shutdown is **not directly documented in the provided Beige Book excerpts** and should be treated as an illustrative example rather than a fully cited case. [Sub\u20111; Sub\u20113]\n  - In causal terms, such a shutdown would be: **caused by** a spike in steel costs that made continued production uneconomic; **as a result**, the firm halted production lines, demonstrating the most severe form of supply chain impact\u2014outright loss of output rather than mere delay or cost pressure.\n\n4. Policy uncertainty and labor constraints \u2192 Reduced flexibility in responding to supply disruptions\n- In the New York district, **uncertainty relating to tariffs continued to weigh on manufacturers**. This was caused by shifting or unclear trade policies, which complicate planning for sourcing, pricing, and investment. [Sub\u20111]\n  - As a result, manufacturers likely hesitated to commit to new long-term supply arrangements or capacity expansions, reducing their ability to quickly reconfigure supply chains in response to disruptions and thereby amplifying the production impact of cost increases and shortages.\n\n- Nationally, **labor supply in manufacturing was strained in several districts**. This was caused by tight labor markets and hiring difficulties. [Sub\u20111]\n  - As a result, even when materials were available, some firms had less capacity to run additional shifts or reorganize production to work around delayed inputs, making them more vulnerable to supply chain problems and limiting their ability to ramp up output.\n\n5. Overall cause\u2013effect summary\n- Supply chain disruptions\u2014**difficulty procuring equipment and materials, rising input and tariff-related costs, and policy/labor constraints**\u2014caused manufacturers to face:\n  - Higher and more volatile production costs;\n  - Procurement-related delays and risks to production schedules;\n  - Flat or weakening indicators of activity (e.g., **new orders down and shipments mostly unchanged** in New York);\n  - Pressures to raise output prices, cut margins, or scale back production growth;\n  - In extreme, though not widely documented, cases, **temporary shutdowns of production lines** when cost spikes (e.g., in steel) made operation uneconomical.\n\nAs a result of these intertwined factors, manufacturing production in affected districts generally stayed flat rather than expanding, became more costly to operate, and faced heightened risk of both short-term interruptions and longer-term underinvestment in capacity.\n",

      "question": "What service-related costs contributed to input cost increases, and how did this affect different sectors?",
      "expected": "Several service-related costs drove input cost increases: insurance, health care, and technology solutions all saw higher costs. In New York, rising business costs including insurance added to financial pressures for community service providers. Employer-sponsored health insurance expenses saw outsized increases, intensifying labor cost pressures across districts. These service cost increases occurred alongside tariff-driven goods cost increases.",
      "predicted": "Service-related costs that drove input cost increases\n\n\u2022 The main service-related cost pressures were:\n  \u2022 Insurance services \u2013 commercial insurance premiums and related coverage costs rose. This was cited explicitly as a driver of faster input cost inflation at the national level and by professional and business services contacts who reported elevated insurance costs. This was caused by broad increases in the price of insurance services that firms purchase as overhead. [BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary > Prices]\n  \n  \u2022 Health care services \u2013 employer-sponsored health insurance and other health care\u2013related expenses increased. This was caused by rising prices for health care services and benefits, which show up as higher labor-related service costs for firms. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  \n  \u2022 Technology solutions \u2013 including software, IT services, and related tech support. This was caused by higher prices for technology-related services that many firms rely on for operations, leading to higher nonlabor operating costs. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\nThese categories together meant that \u201cinput costs increased at a faster pace due to \u2026 the higher cost of services such as insurance, health care, and technology solutions.\u201d [BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary > Prices]\n\nCause \u2192 effect by sector\n\n1. Professional and business services\n\n\u2022 Cause: Higher prices for insurance services and technology solutions, along with rising employer-sponsored health insurance expenses. Professional and business services firms typically spend heavily on these overhead categories.\n  \u2022 Insurance: Firms reported elevated insurance costs. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  \u2022 Technology: Contacts noted higher costs for technology solutions, software, and IT-related services. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n  \u2022 Health benefits: Employer-sponsored health insurance was identified as a key service-related labor cost pressure. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n\u2022 Effect: \n  \u2022 As a result, professional and business services firms experienced higher nonlabor overhead and total input costs.\n  \u2022 This was caused by service-price increases feeding directly into their cost structure, since these sectors rely more on purchased services (insurance, IT, health-related benefits) than on physical materials.\n  \u2022 As a result, overall input cost inflation in this sector picked up, contributing to the faster pace of input cost increases reported in the national summary.\n\n2. Manufacturing\n\n\u2022 Cause: While the primary manufacturing pressures described in the excerpts stem from imported goods (e.g., semiconductor chips) rather than services, these import-related cost increases interact with the broader service-cost environment.\n  \u2022 San Francisco manufacturers reported higher materials input costs and specifically higher costs for imported semiconductor chips. [BeigeBook_20251015, FRB San Francisco > Manufacturing]\n\n\u2022 Effect:\n  \u2022 As a result, manufacturers faced a higher overall input cost base, especially for technologically intensive products.\n  \u2022 This was caused mainly by higher import and tariff-related costs, but it occurred alongside the national rise in service-related costs (insurance, health care, technology solutions), so manufacturing firms also operated against a backdrop of more expensive supporting services even if the Beige Book excerpt does not single that out for manufacturing.\n\n3. Consumer-facing sectors (restaurants, retail, hospitality, tourism)\n\n\u2022 Cause: The cited evidence for these sectors focuses more on ingredient and import costs than on service costs, but they are still indirectly affected by the same national service-cost trends.\n  \u2022 New York restaurants reported that costs for imported wine and beef were \u201cescalating and hurting their businesses.\u201d [BeigeBook_20251015, FRB New York > Prices]\n  \u2022 At the same time, nationally, insurance, health care, and technology solutions became more expensive for all firms, including restaurants and retailers. [BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary > Prices]\n\n\u2022 Effect:\n  \u2022 As a result, restaurants in New York experienced a squeeze from rising food/ingredient costs (e.g., imported wine, beef) layered on top of the general environment of higher service overhead (insurance, health care benefits, IT and payment systems).\n  \u2022 This was caused by input cost escalation both in goods (ingredients) and in services, which \u201churt their businesses,\u201d indicating margin pressure. However, the evidence does not provide quantitative detail on how much of this squeeze came specifically from service-related costs versus ingredients.\n  \u2022 For retail, hospitality, and tourism more broadly, the excerpts do not give specific examples of service-cost impacts, but because insurance, health care, and technology costs were rising nationally, these sectors likely saw higher overhead as well. Any statement beyond that remains an inference not directly documented in the provided text.\n\n4. Cross-sector, national impact\n\n\u2022 Cause: Nationally, input costs \u201cincreased at a faster pace due to higher import costs and the higher cost of services such as insurance, health care, and technology solutions,\u201d and tariff-induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts. [BeigeBook_20251015, National Summary > Prices]\n\n\u2022 Effect:\n  \u2022 As a result, virtually all sectors\u2014service-oriented and goods-producing\u2014faced a more inflationary cost environment.\n  \u2022 In service-heavy industries (like professional and business services), the effect showed up mainly as higher overhead and labor-related service costs.\n  \u2022 In goods-producing and consumer-facing sectors (like manufacturing and restaurants), the effect showed up as a combination of higher imported material/ingredient costs and the same rising service overhead that all firms face.\n\nIn summary: higher costs for insurance services, health care services (including employer-sponsored health insurance), and technology solutions caused a broad-based rise in firms\u2019 nonlabor and labor-related input costs. As a result, professional and business services experienced notably higher overhead; manufacturers and other goods producers operated in a higher-cost environment shaped by both import and service-price pressures; and consumer-facing sectors like restaurants saw escalating input costs, particularly for key ingredients, compounded by the general increase in service-related overhead costs.",

      "expected": "In Chicago, leisure and hospitality sales were mixed. Categories seeing gains included restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments, as well as new light vehicle sales which were brisk due to strong underlying demand and the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases. Categories seeing softness included travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels. Used vehicle sales remained steady though dealerships in low-to-moderate income communities reported softer demand. This pattern reflects consumers seeking value in dining while cutting back on travel.",
      "predicted": "Below is a side\u2011by\u2011side comparison of **retail categories with gains vs. declines**, followed by how each pattern reflects **consumer behavior**.\n\n---\n## 1. Overall Retail Goods vs. Restaurants & Services\n\n**Retail goods (non\u2011auto, broadline)**  \n- Performance: Flat to slight declines in many broad goods categories; non\u2011auto retailers reported slight sales decreases in several districts, and major retailers\u2019 same\u2011store sales underperformed year\u2011earlier levels. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015; Philadelphia \u2013 Trade and Services]  \n- Consumer pattern: Indicates **cautious, value\u2011seeking behavior** on general merchandise; households are trimming or delaying broad goods purchases after a strong summer, and watching price and promotions more carefully.\n\n**Restaurants and consumer-facing services**  \n- Performance: Clear gains: \n  - Richmond: **Luxury and quick\u2011service restaurants** reported solid revenue growth; overall restaurant spending grew modestly. [Richmond \u2013 Retail, Travel, and Tourism; Summary of Economic Activity]  \n  - Chicago: Increased spending at **fast food, fast casual, and family dining** restaurants. [Chicago \u2013 Consumer Spending]  \n  - San Francisco: **Quick\u2011service restaurants** continued to see growing demand. [San Francisco \u2013 Retail Trade and Services]  \n- Consumer pattern: Reflects **ongoing willingness to spend on experiences and convenience** (eating out, especially quick\u2011service and some luxury), even as goods spending softens. Consumers are prioritizing time\u2011saving and experiential purchases.\n\n**Contrast:** Goods retailers face soft or flat demand, while restaurants\u2014especially quick\u2011service and select higher\u2011end venues\u2014are among the strongest gainers, signaling a **shift from \u201cstuff\u201d toward experiences and convenience**.\n\n---\n## 2. Specific Gaining Categories vs. Specific Declining Categories\n\n### A. Gaining Categories (Goods & Niche Retail)\n\n**Small higher\u2011end retailers**  \n- Performance: In Richmond, some **small higher\u2011end retailers** reported solid growth in sales. [Richmond \u2013 Retail, Travel, and Tourism]  \n- Consumer pattern: Suggests a segment of consumers remains willing to pay for **premium, higher\u2011quality or status goods**, consistent with **selective discretionary spending** at the upper end of the market.\n\n**Appliances, computers, and landscaping-related goods**  \n- Performance: Consumer spending rose strongly on **appliances, computers, and landscaping**, aided by a healthy back\u2011to\u2011school season. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- Consumer pattern: Indicates targeted willingness to invest in **functional big\u2011ticket or home\u2011related items** when there\u2019s a clear need (e.g., school, home projects), even as other discretionary goods are deferred. Spending is **needs\u2011driven, not broad\u2011based**.\n\n**Food & beverage and health\u2011care retailers (essentials)**  \n- Performance: In Dallas, **food and beverage retailers** and **health\u2011care retailers** reported flat to slight increases in activity. [Dallas \u2013 Retail Sales]  \n- Consumer pattern: Essentials are being **protected in household budgets**. Consumers are maintaining or slightly increasing spend on groceries and health\u2011related items, consistent with **prioritizing necessities over discretionary goods**.\n\n### B. Declining / Soft Categories\n\n**Non\u2011auto retail goods and major retailers**  \n- Performance: Non\u2011auto retail goods overall showed flat\u2011to\u2011slight declines; major retailers\u2019 same\u2011store sales underperformed year\u2011ago levels. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- Consumer pattern: Shows **broad restraint** in day\u2011to\u2011day goods spending, with households likely **trading down, buying less often, or waiting for deals**.\n\n**Furniture**  \n- Performance: \n  - Dallas: Furniture stores saw lower sales. [Dallas \u2013 Retail Sales]  \n  - Richmond: A furniture store reported fewer sales; housing market weakness negatively affected furniture firms. [Richmond \u2013 Retail, Travel, and Tourism; Manufacturing]  \n- Consumer pattern: Furniture is a classic **postponable, big\u2011ticket purchase**; weaker sales signal households are **deferring larger home\u2011related outlays**, likely due to tighter budgets and housing market uncertainty.\n\n**Building materials and garden equipment**  \n- Performance: Dallas reported lower sales at **building material and garden equipment** stores. [Dallas \u2013 Retail Sales]  \n- Consumer pattern: Suggests a cooling of **home improvement and yard projects**, again pointing to pullbacks in **discretionary, home\u2011investment spending** after prior strength.\n\n**Electronic and appliance stores / some consumer electronics**  \n- Performance: \n  - Dallas: **Electronic and appliance stores** saw lower sales. [Dallas \u2013 Retail Sales]  \n  - Nationally, **\u201cother consumer electronics\u201d** were singled out as weak. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- Consumer pattern: Indicates that outside of specific needs (e.g., computers for school), households are **slowing upgrades and add\u2011on gadget purchases**, treating many electronics as **nice\u2011to\u2011have rather than must\u2011have**.\n\n**Autos and sporting goods**  \n- Performance:  \n  - Kansas City: Sales of goods declined moderately, **particularly for automotive and sporting goods**. [Kansas City \u2013 Consumer Spending]  \n  - Dallas: Auto dealers reported **weak sales**. [Dallas \u2013 Retail Sales]  \n- Consumer pattern: These are **high\u2011ticket or discretionary** items. Weakness here underscores a trend toward **avoiding large commitments and trimming recreational gear purchases** when budgets are under pressure.\n\n**Broader regional retail softness**  \n- Performance:  \n  - Dallas: Retail sales fell overall in the district. [National Summary \u2013 Highlights by District, Dallas]  \n  - New York: Retail firms reported moderate declines in business activity. [New York \u2013 Services]  \n  - Atlanta and Dallas also reported weaker overall retail sales. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- Consumer pattern: Reinforces that **soft goods demand is not isolated**; it\u2019s a multi\u2011district pattern of **tepid or weakening retail spending**.\n\n**Travel\u2013related leisure and hospitality retail**  \n- Performance: Travel spending was described as **mixed**, and some travel\u2011related leisure and hospitality categories experienced softness with expectations of lower foot traffic and revenues. [Richmond \u2013 Summary of Economic Activity; BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- Consumer pattern: Suggests **more selective tourism and leisure spending**, potentially prioritizing essential travel or local outings over more discretionary, higher\u2011cost leisure trips and related retail.\n\n---\n## 3. Value\u2011Seeking vs. Experience\u2011Seeking Behavior\n\n**Value\u2011seeking in goods retail**  \n- Evidence: Kansas City contacts highlighted **heightened price sensitivity**, with \u201csales, deals, and markdowns\u201d driving **small surges** in purchasing rather than steady demand. [Kansas City \u2013 Consumer Spending]  \n- Behavior: Consumers are \n  - **Timing purchases around promotions** \n  - **Trading down** or postponing discretionary and big\u2011ticket items (furniture, autos, electronics, sporting goods, home\u2011improvement goods)  \n  This aligns with the broad declines in these categories.\n\n**Experience\u2011 and convenience\u2011seeking in services and select goods**  \n- Evidence:  \n  - Solid growth in **luxury, fast food, fast casual, family dining, and quick\u2011service restaurants** across several districts. [Richmond; Chicago; San Francisco]  \n  - Strength at **small higher\u2011end retailers** in Richmond and targeted gains in appliances/computers tied to back\u2011to\u2011school. [Richmond \u2013 Retail, Travel, and Tourism; BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- Behavior: Consumers are still **willing to pay for experiences (dining out)** and for **targeted, necessary upgrades** (appliances, computers), while pulling back on broader goods. This points to:  \n  - A **\u201cselective splurging\u201d** pattern (e.g., luxury dining, higher\u2011end niche retail) among some consumers  \n  - A broad preference for **convenience (quick\u2011service)** over more time\u2011intensive or mid\u2011tier options\n\n---\n## 4. Seasonal and Timing Effects\n\n**Seasonal slowing in non\u2011auto retail**  \n- Performance: Non\u2011auto retailers in Philadelphia reported a **slight sales decrease** this period after a slight increase in the prior period, consistent with a **post\u2011summer seasonal slowdown**. [Philadelphia \u2013 Trade and Services; BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- Behavior: After **unusually strong summer spending**, consumers are **pulling back earlier than usual in the fall**, especially in general retail goods. Some firms expect continued lower foot traffic and margin pressure through year\u2011end. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n**Business spending vs. consumer retail timing**  \n- Chicago noted that **business spending** declined slightly in late August and September, but the Beige Book excerpts do not explicitly time retail declines to those exact months. [Chicago \u2013 Business Spending]  \n- Interpretation: We can link **recent softening** to the late\u2011summer/early\u2011fall period, but precise timing of the retail turn is partly interpretive rather than directly dated in the text.\n\n---\n## 5. Summary: What the Gains vs. Declines Say About Consumers\n\n- **Gaining categories** (restaurants, quick\u2011service and some luxury; small higher\u2011end retailers; essentials like food & health\u2011care retail; targeted purchases like appliances and computers) reflect:  \n  - **Prioritization of essentials**  \n  - **Selective spending on experiences and convenience**  \n  - **Targeted, needs\u2011driven big\u2011ticket purchases**, especially when tied to life events (e.g., back\u2011to\u2011school)\n\n- **Declining categories** (non\u2011auto broad retail goods, furniture, building materials/garden equipment, electronics/appliance stores, autos, sporting goods, some tourism\u2011related retail) reflect:  \n  - **Budget constraints and caution**, particularly for big\u2011ticket and discretionary items  \n  - **Heightened price sensitivity**, with purchases bunched around discounts  \n  - **Deferral of home\u2011related and durable\u2011goods projects** after earlier strength\n\nSide by side, the pattern is a **hybrid consumer**: \n- **Defensive and value\u2011oriented in most goods categories**, \n- Yet still **willing to spend on experiences (especially dining out), convenience, and selective premium or necessary items**, leading to gains in restaurants and certain niche or essential retail segments, alongside broad softness in general goods retail.",

[Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- Operation of **active oil and gas rigs**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- Broader **oil and gas sector activity** and **capital expenditures**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**How it compares**\n- Like Minneapolis, Kansas City experienced **declining energy activity**, but the detail here focuses on **rig counts, drilling, and capex**. This contrasts with Atlanta\u2019s expanding and more diversified energy portfolio and with Dallas\u2019s flat conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Dallas \u2013 Eleventh District\n**Performance**\n- **Drilling and well completion activity remained flat**, indicating **neither growth nor decline** in the period. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Specific activities mentioned**\n- **Drilling activity**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Well completion activity**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n- **Oil production**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**How it compares**\n- Relative to other districts, Dallas is **stable but stagnant**: not expanding like Atlanta\u2019s energy sector, but also not contracting like Minneapolis and Kansas City. It is heavily focused on **upstream oil and gas (drilling, completions, production)** with no explicit reference to renewables or power.\n\n---\n\n### Boston \u2013 First District\n**Performance**\n- Boston\u2019s commentary focused on **energy prices**, which **increased by at least moderate margins**, rather than on physical activity levels. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Specific activities mentioned**\n- No detailed listing of activities like drilling, production, or renewables; the emphasis is on **price movements** rather than operational metrics. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**How it compares**\n- Unlike Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis, where specific **operational activities** (drilling, exploration, production, LNG, solar) are discussed, Boston mainly reflects the **cost and price side** of energy, without a clear statement on whether local energy production or related activity is expanding or contracting.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-District Comparison Summary\n- **Direction of performance**\n  - **Expanding**: Atlanta (moderate growth across multiple energy segments). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - **Flat**: Dallas (drilling and well completions unchanged). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - **Declining**: Minneapolis (overall activity down, especially exploration) and Kansas City (oil and gas activity, rigs, and drilling down modestly). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - **Price-focused, activity not specified**: Boston (energy prices up at least moderately). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n- **Types of activities emphasized**\n  - **Upstream oil & gas** (exploration, drilling, rigs, wells, production): Strongly emphasized in Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - **Broader mix including mid/downstream and power**: Atlanta (crude production, refined products demand, LNG, electricity). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - **Energy transition / renewables**: Explicitly mentioned only in Atlanta (solar development, carbon capture and storage). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n  - **Prices instead of activity levels**: Boston (energy prices rising). [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\nIn sum, Atlanta stands out for **moderate growth and diversified, including renewable and transition-oriented activities**, Dallas is **stable but concentrated in upstream oil and gas**, while Minneapolis and Kansas City show **declines primarily in upstream oil and gas**, and Boston\u2019s report centers on **rising energy prices rather than described activity levels**.",

      "expected": "In Kansas City, while expectations for 2026 were optimistic, consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately, signaling stress among households. In Chicago, business loan demand decreased slightly on net with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity, while consumer loan demand increased slightly with a pickup in mortgage refinancing. In Dallas, loan demand grew overall. St. Louis reported banking activity unchanged with strong overall credit conditions. Consumer lending showed some signs of stress while business lending conditions were mixed.",
      "predicted": "Across districts, banks generally saw **more softness in business lending than in consumer lending**, but the pattern varied by district. Below is a side\u2011by\u2011side comparison by key aspect and district where evidence is available.\n\n---\n### 1. Overall loan demand: consumer vs. business\n\n**New York (Second District)**  \n- **Consumer:** Demand for consumer loans held **steady** at small\u2011to\u2011medium\u2011sized banks. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB New York]  \n- **Business:** Overall loan demand **declined**, and banks **explicitly attributed** this drop to **sagging demand for business loans**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB New York]\n\n**Philadelphia (Third District)**  \n- **Consumer:** **Consumer lending (excluding auto and credit card)** rose **moderately**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Philadelphia]  \n- **Business:** Overall lending fell **moderately**, driven by a **continued strong decline in commercial and industrial (C&I) loans** and a **modest decline in commercial real estate (CRE) loans**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Philadelphia]\n\n**Chicago (Seventh District)**  \n- **Consumer:** No specific change reported in the cited excerpt.  \n- **Business:** **Business loan demand decreased slightly on net**, suggesting some softening on the business side. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Chicago]\n\n**Cleveland (Fourth District)**  \n- **Consumer:** Loan demand from **households increased moderately**, supported by lower interest rates. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Cleveland]  \n- **Business:** Loan demand from **businesses also increased moderately** for the same reason, making Cleveland an exception where both segments strengthened. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Cleveland]\n\n**Kansas City (Tenth District)**  \n- **Consumer:** Banks reported **little change in consumer loan demand or credit standards**, but noted **moderate deterioration in consumer loan portfolios**, even as overall loan quality remained sound. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Kansas City]  \n- **Business:** Earlier summaries indicate little change in overall loan demand or standards, without a specific emphasis on weakening business demand. (Direct text not reproduced in the refined evidence set.)\n\n---\n### 2. Credit standards and underwriting\n\n**New York**  \n- **Consumer:** With demand steady and no major deterioration noted, standards appear broadly unchanged in the cited material. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB New York]  \n- **Business:** Sagging demand for business loans, not a sharp tightening of standards, is identified as the main factor behind weaker overall loan demand. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB New York]\n\n**Philadelphia**  \n- **Consumer:** Rising consumer lending (ex\u2011auto and cards) suggests that **standards were not binding enough to prevent growth**, though explicit wording on standards is not provided. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Philadelphia]  \n- **Business:** The **strong decline in C&I and modest decline in CRE** indicates either tighter standards, weaker demand, or both for business borrowers; the Beige Book attributes the volume changes to those loan categories but does not parse standards vs. demand in the cited excerpt. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Philadelphia]\n\n**St. Louis (Eighth District)**  \n- **Consumer:** Overall consumer credit conditions remained **strong**, but standards tightened. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB St. Louis]  \n- **Business:** Bankers **tightened standards and increased scrutiny of small business loans**, and one banker reported **depressed small business credit demand**, even as some contacts noted strong commercial loan demand. This points to more cautious conditions for business borrowers than for consumers. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB St. Louis]\n\n**Kansas City**  \n- **Consumer:** **Little change** in standards overall, but **moderate deterioration in consumer loan portfolios** was noted. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Kansas City]  \n- **Business:** Standards and demand were reported as **largely unchanged**, implying relatively stable conditions for business credit compared with the emerging strain in consumer portfolios. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Kansas City]\n\n---\n### 3. Portfolio performance and risk signals\n\n**Kansas City**  \n- **Consumer:** Banks observed **moderate deterioration in consumer loan portfolios**, signaling rising risk or delinquencies in that segment even though overall credit quality was still sound. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Kansas City]  \n- **Business:** No comparable deterioration was highlighted for business portfolios, indicating relatively better performance on the commercial side. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Kansas City]\n\n**St. Louis**  \n- **Consumer:** Credit conditions described as **strong**, with tightening standards more pre\u2011emptive than reactive. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB St. Louis]  \n- **Business:** Increased scrutiny of small business loans and reports of **depressed small business credit demand** suggest heightened risk concerns in business lending compared with consumers. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB St. Louis]\n\nOther documented districts (New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Cleveland) focus more on **volumes and demand** than on explicit portfolio performance differences between consumer and business loans in the cited excerpts.\n\n---\n### 4. Cross\u2011district pattern: consumer vs. business\n\n- **Business lending generally softer than consumer lending in several districts:**  \n  - In **New York**, overall loan demand fell because **business loan demand sagged**, while **consumer demand held steady**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB New York]  \n  - In **Philadelphia**, overall lending declined as **C&I and CRE loans fell**, even as **consumer lending (ex\u2011auto, cards) rose moderately**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Philadelphia]  \n  - In **Chicago**, **business loan demand decreased slightly on net**, with no parallel evidence of consumer weakness in the cited text. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Chicago]  \n  - In **St. Louis**, banks tightened and scrutinized **small business loans** and reported **depressed small business credit demand**, even as consumer credit conditions remained strong. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB St. Louis]\n\n- **Consumer lending steadier or stronger where detailed:**  \n  - **New York:** Consumer loan demand **steady** vs. weaker business demand. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB New York]  \n  - **Philadelphia:** Consumer lending **up** while business lending **down**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Philadelphia]  \n  - **Cleveland:** Both consumer and business loan demand **up moderately**, making it an exception where **neither side is soft**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Cleveland]\n\n- **Emerging consumer\u2011side strain in specific districts:**  \n  - **Kansas City:** Notable for **moderate deterioration in consumer loan portfolios**, even though demand and standards were broadly unchanged, and business conditions appeared more stable. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, FRB Kansas City]\n\n---\n### Bottom line comparison\n\n- **Across many districts (New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis):**  \n  - **Business lending**: Softer demand and/or tighter scrutiny, particularly for C&I, CRE, and small business loans.  \n  - **Consumer lending**: Generally **steady or improving demand**, with some districts tightening standards but not seeing the same broad softness in volumes.\n\n- **Notable exceptions and nuances:**  \n  - **Cleveland** shows **strength in both consumer and business lending**.  \n  - **Kansas City** shows **stable demand/standards** but **deteriorating consumer portfolios**, suggesting more emerging risk on the consumer side than on the business side there.\n\nOverall, the evidence points to **more pervasive softness and caution in business lending than in consumer lending across districts**, with some regional exceptions and a few signs of emerging consumer credit strain (notably in Kansas City).",

      "expected": "In Dallas, price pressures were subdued in services but remained elevated in the manufacturing sector. In Richmond, price growth remained moderate overall despite some pickup in price growth in the manufacturing sector. In Chicago, producer prices grew moderately with contacts reporting moderate nonlabor cost increases including energy and raw materials. Manufacturing contacts attributed some raw materials price increases to tariffs, suggesting tariffs disproportionately affected goods-producing sectors.",
      "predicted": "Across Federal Reserve Districts, price pressures were consistently stronger in manufacturing than in services, but the pattern and intensity varied by region.\n\n**Overall pattern**  \n- Manufacturing: Price pressures were elevated, driven largely by rising input and materials costs, and in some cases by tariffs. Input and selling prices were generally rising at a strong or accelerating pace. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]  \n- Services: Price pressures were generally subdued or stable, with only moderate increases in input and selling prices and relatively little recent acceleration. Many service firms, however, expected some price increases going forward. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Richmond District**  \n- Manufacturing: Price growth had **picked up**, indicating increasing cost and price pressures on manufacturers. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]  \n- Services: Service-sector firms reported **virtually no change in price growth**, suggesting much more stable and subdued price pressures compared with manufacturing in the same District. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Kansas City District**  \n- Manufacturing: Input prices for manufacturers were growing at a **strong pace and remained elevated**, and high input costs were cited as one of manufacturers\u2019 most significant burdens. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]  \n- Services: For services, both input and anticipated selling price growth were **moderate and softer than in manufacturing**, indicating milder and more contained price pressures relative to the manufacturing sector. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Dallas (Eleventh) District**  \n- Manufacturing: Manufacturing selling prices **rose more sharply than in the overall economy**, with price pressures described as **elevated**, partly due to tariffs increasing costs. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]  \n- Services: Service-sector price pressures were **subdued** over the reporting period, although firms **expected selling price increases to accelerate over the next 12 months**, pointing to weaker current but potentially stronger future pressures compared with manufacturing\u2019s already elevated pressures. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]\n\n**Other Districts (manufacturing-specific notes)**  \n- Manufacturing in New York, San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Atlanta faced **higher or increasing input/materials costs** and concern over rising costs, reinforcing the picture of broad-based manufacturing price pressures. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2025-10-15]  \n- Parallel detail for services in these Districts was not highlighted, but available comparisons (Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas) consistently show **stronger pressures in manufacturing than in services**.\n\n**Summary comparison**  \n- In multiple Districts, **manufacturing** is characterized by strong, sometimes accelerating price pressures, with elevated input and selling prices and specific burdens like tariffs.  \n- In contrast, **services** generally show subdued or stable price pressures, with only moderate increases and less recent acceleration, though some service firms anticipate more price growth ahead.  \nOverall, the data indicate that, during the period covered, price pressures were **more intense and more widespread in manufacturing than in services** across the Federal Reserve Districts.

      "question": "How did hiring patterns change, and what does this indicate about employer confidence?",
      "expected": "Employers showed cautious hiring behavior: More employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. Those still hiring favored temporary and part-time workers over full-time employment. In Boston, both hiring and layoffs increased modestly, indicating churn rather than net growth. Employment in IT services increased modestly with hiring in sales and technical positions - a relative bright spot. Jobseekers in Cleveland reported offers were more likely to be part-time with little or no benefits. This pattern indicates employer uncertainty and reluctance to commit to permanent workforce expansion.",
      "predicted": "Hiring patterns shifted in ways that both reflected and reinforced a cooling in employer confidence, without signaling a full collapse in sentiment.\n\n1. **From expansion to \u201creplacement-only\u201d hiring**  \n- **What changed:** Many firms moved from expansionary hiring to **hiring mainly to replace departures**, holding overall head counts flat. The San Francisco Fed reported that \u201cmost employers hired only to replace workers, holding head counts steady.\u201d [San Francisco District, Labor Markets]\n- **Cause:** This was caused by **weaker or slowing demand** and **elevated cost pressures**, which made firms reluctant to commit to new, permanent positions. Nationally, \u201cdemand for labor was generally muted across Districts and sectors.\u201d [National Summary > Labor Markets]\n- **Effect on confidence indicator:** As a result, this pattern points to **cautious employer confidence**: firms are not confident enough to grow staff aggressively, but they are confident enough in their baseline business to maintain existing staffing rather than cutting deeply.\n\n2. **More head\u2011count reductions in specific sectors**  \n- **What changed:** Instead of broad\u2011based hiring increases, there were **targeted reductions** in sectors facing weaker demand:\n  - Manufacturing and health care in the San Francisco District cut staff via \u201cattrition, layoffs, and early retirements.\u201d [San Francisco District, Labor Markets]\n  - The New York District reported \u201cfairly significant declines in head counts\u201d in **education, health care, retail, construction, and transportation**, while only modest gains were seen in **wholesale, finance, business services, and personal services**. [New York District, Labor Markets]\n  - Richmond contacts reduced head count in response to **slowing demand**, with a couple expecting **future cuts**. [Richmond District, Labor Markets]\n  - Boston manufacturing employment was \u201cunchanged on balance,\u201d with at least one firm shedding workers because of weak demand. [Boston District, Labor Markets]\n- **Cause:** These shifts were caused by **sector\u2011specific demand slowdowns** and by firms trying to manage **higher cost structures** (for example, wages and other input costs). The national summary notes that in most Districts more employers were \u201clowering head counts through layoffs and attrition, with contacts citing weaker demand [and] elevated\u201d economic pressures. [National Summary > Labor Markets]\n- **Effect on confidence indicator:** As a result, confidence is **selectively weaker** where demand has deteriorated most. Employers in those sectors are signaling **lower confidence in their near\u2011term outlook**, using layoffs and attrition to resize their workforce rather than betting on a quick rebound.\n\n3. **National pattern: muted labor demand and stable employment**  \n- **What changed:** Across the country, \u201cemployment levels were largely stable in recent weeks, and demand for labor was generally muted.\u201d [National Summary > Labor Markets]\n  - In **Boston**, employment was flat, with both hiring and layoffs increasing modestly. [Boston District]\n  - In **Minneapolis**, \u201clabor demand softened, according to firms and job seekers.\u201d [Minneapolis District]\n- **Cause:** This was caused by an economy where growth and demand are **slowing but not collapsing**. Firms are feeling **pressure from costs and weaker sales**, which discourages aggressive expansion but doesn\u2019t yet force mass layoffs in many regions.\n- **Effect on confidence indicator:** As a result, the overall hiring stance\u2014stable employment with muted new demand for labor\u2014signals **subdued but not disastrous confidence**. Employers are in a \u201cwait\u2011and\u2011see\u201d mode, preserving core staff while avoiding large new commitments.\n\n4. **Use of attrition and gradual trimming rather than mass layoffs**  \n- **What changed:** In most Districts, more employers reported lowering head counts \u201cthrough layoffs and attrition.\u201d [National Summary > Labor Markets] Several contacts, particularly in manufacturing and health care, used **attrition, early retirements, and selective layoffs** instead of broad cuts. [San Francisco District; Richmond District]\n- **Cause:** This was caused by **risk\u2011averse behavior under uncertainty**: firms expect softer conditions, but they do not yet foresee a deep or prolonged downturn. Using attrition allows them to reduce costs gradually and reversibly.\n- **Effect on confidence indicator:** As a result, this pattern indicates **cautious, not panicked, expectations**. Employers are clearly **less confident** than during an expansion, but the reliance on attrition (rather than sweeping layoff waves) suggests they are trying to manage near\u2011term risks rather than reacting to a perceived crisis.\n\n5. **Pockets of continued hiring and modest growth**  \n- **What changed:** Despite muted demand, some areas and sectors continued to add staff:\n  - The **Philadelphia** District reported that \u201cemployment levels increased slightly, and wages again rose at modest pre\u2011pandemic rates,\u201d implying continued hiring appetite. [Philadelphia District]\n  - In parts of **New York**, wholesale, finance, business services, and personal services reported slight\u2011to\u2011modest hiring increases. [New York District]\n- **Cause:** This was caused by **more resilient or growing demand** in these segments and by firms that still see viable opportunities despite broader headwinds.\n- **Effect on confidence indicator:** As a result, these pockets of hiring show that **employer confidence is uneven rather than uniformly low**. Some firms still feel confident enough to add workers, even as others pull back.\n\n6. **How hiring levels map to confidence overall**  \n- **Increased or expansionary hiring** (net new positions, plans for larger staffs) is typically a sign that employers are **confident about future demand and conditions**\u2014they expect enough business to justify long\u2011term payroll commitments. Where Districts report slight employment gains (e.g., Philadelphia) or sectors with modest upticks in hiring (e.g., parts of New York\u2019s service economy), this reflects **relatively stronger confidence** in those niches.\n- **Flat or reduced hiring**, a shift to **replacement\u2011only** strategies, and willingness to use **attrition and layoffs** to lower head counts are typically linked to **elevated uncertainty, weaker demand, and cost pressures**. The nationwide pattern of \u201cgenerally muted\u201d labor demand, more use of layoffs and attrition, and replacement\u2011only hiring in places like San Francisco clearly indicates **tempered or reduced employer confidence**.\n\nPutting these pieces together:  \nThis environment of replacement\u2011only hiring, selective head\u2011count reductions, and muted labor demand was caused by **weaker demand and higher economic pressures** across many industries and regions. As a result, employers have shifted from growth to preservation\u2014maintaining core staff, trimming around the edges, and delaying broad expansion. This behavior indicates **cautious, risk\u2011averse confidence**: businesses are no longer in a strong expansionary mindset, but they are also not acting as if a severe downturn is inevitable, as shown by largely stable overall employment and continuing (if modest) hiring in some areas.",

Financial conditions loosened slightly (better than mixed national picture). Construction/real estate increased slightly (better than mixed national). Farm income prospects unchanged. Compared to national trends, Chicago showed relative strength in financial conditions and construction while consumer spending and manufacturing weakness aligned with or slightly underperformed broader trends.",
      "predicted": "Below is a side\u2011by\u2011side comparison of the key economic indicators for the Chicago (Seventh) District versus the broader U.S. picture as reflected in the October 15, 2025 Beige Book. All Chicago assessments are qualitative; the Beige Book does not provide hard numerical growth rates.\n\n---\n## 1. Overall Economic Activity\n\n- **Chicago (Seventh District)**  \n  Economic activity was **little changed / flat** over the reporting period, and contacts **expected a slight decrease in activity over the next year**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015 \u2013 Chicago Summary of Economic Activity]\n\n- **United States / Other Districts**  \n  Nationwide, overall economic activity **\u201cchanged little on balance\u201d** compared with the prior report, implying a generally flat national picture as well. Some individual districts (for example, Philadelphia) reported that **\u201cbusiness activity increased slightly.\u201d** [Sub\u2011Query 3 & 4 synthesis]\n\n- **Comparison**  \n  Chicago\u2019s overall activity was **in line with the national summary** (\u201clittle changed\u201d), but **softer than at least some districts** that reported **slight increases**. There is **no quantitative basis** in the Beige Book to say Chicago was definitively growing slower than the nation as a whole, only that it was **flat while some others were expanding slightly**.\n\n---\n## 2. Consumer Spending\n\n- **Chicago**  \n  **Consumer spending increased modestly** over the reporting period. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015 \u2013 Chicago Consumer Spending]\n\n- **United States / Other Districts**  \n  Several districts also reported **modest** gains:\n  - Boston: \u201cEconomic activity expanded slightly, with **modest growth in consumer spending**.\u201d  \n  - New York: \u201c**Consumer spending increased modestly** over the reported period.\u201d  \n  - Richmond: \u201cOn balance, **consumer spending increased modestly** in recent weeks.\u201d [Sub\u2011Query 3]\n\n- **Comparison**  \n  Chicago\u2019s consumer spending performance was **broadly similar to national patterns**, with **modest increases** comparable to Boston, New York, and Richmond. There is no indication that Chicago was notably stronger or weaker than these peers on this dimension.\n\n---\n## 3. Business Spending / Investment\n\n- **Chicago**  \n  Business spending is treated as a distinct category from nonbusiness activity. The national highlights note that **\u201cnonbusiness contacts saw no change in activity; business spending d\u2026\u201d**, indicating **some degree of decline in business spending**, though the exact phrase (for example, \u201cdeclined slightly\u201d) is truncated and not fully available. Earlier synthesis characterizes this as **business investment and capital expenditures declining slightly**, but the precise wording and timing **cannot be confirmed** from the excerpt. [Sub\u2011Query 3]\n\n- **United States / Other Districts**  \n  The Beige Book notes that in at least one other district (Philadelphia), **\u201cbusiness activity increased slightly.\u201d** [Sub\u2011Query 4] Other districts also reported some mix of stable to slightly rising business activity, but detailed, comparable national investment metrics are not provided.\n\n- **Comparison**  \n  - Chicago appears to have had **softening business spending (likely a mild decline)**.  \n  - At least some other districts (e.g., Philadelphia) reported **slight increases in business activity**.  \n  This suggests that **Chicago\u2019s business investment environment was weaker than in regions where activity was expanding modestly**, but the Beige Book does not allow a quantified Chicago\u2011vs\u2011U.S. comparison.\n\n---\n## 4. Construction and Real Estate\n\n### 4.1 Overall Construction and Real Estate\n\n- **Chicago**  \n  **Construction and real estate activity increased slightly.** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015 \u2013 Chicago Summary]\n\n- **United States / Other Districts**  \n  Nationally, many districts reported **modest to slight growth** in construction and real estate activity, though some markets were flat or soft in specific segments. The Beige Book gives a mosaic rather than a single national trend line. [Sub\u2011Query 3 & 4 synthesis]\n\n- **Comparison**  \n  Chicago\u2019s overall construction/real estate performance\u2014**slight increase**\u2014appears **broadly consistent with the typical \u201cslight/modest\u201d gains described in several other districts**, not a clear outlier.\n\n### 4.2 Residential Construction and Real Estate\n\n- **Chicago**  \n  - **Residential construction:** **Edged up**.  \n  - **Residential real estate activity (sales/transactions):** **Unchanged**.  \n  - **Home prices:** **Flat**.  \n  - **Rents:** **Increased modestly**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015 \u2013 Chicago]\n\n- **United States / Other Districts**  \n  Across districts, the Beige Book commonly reports **mixed** housing markets: often **flat to slightly rising** activity, **stable to modestly rising prices**, and **some firmness in rents**. Exact national aggregates aren\u2019t given. [Sub\u2011Query 3 & 4 synthesis]\n\n- **Comparison**  \n  Chicago\u2019s residential sector showed a **very mild pickup in construction**, but **flat sales and prices** and **modest rent increases**. That places it toward the **softer end of expansion** relative to areas where both sales and prices were rising, but still **similar in character** (no sharp declines) to national qualitative patterns.\n\n### 4.3 Nonresidential / Industrial & Warehouse Space\n\n- **Chicago**  \n  - **Nonresidential construction:** **Increased slightly**, supported by **robust demand for data centers**.  \n  - **Industrial/warehouse space:** More warehouse inventory was available, and available industrial space was **sitting longer on the market**, despite overall low vacancy rates. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015 \u2013 Chicago]\n\n- **United States / Other Districts**  \n  Nationally, many districts reported **selective strength in industrial and data\u2011center\u2011related projects**, but also signs of **softening in some commercial real estate segments** (e.g., office) and some increase in available space in particular markets. [Sub\u2011Query 3 & 4 synthesis]\n\n- **Comparison**  \n  Chicago\u2019s **data\u2011center\u2011driven nonresidential growth** is **in line with a broader national theme** of strength in that niche, while the **greater warehouse availability and longer listing times** mirror **emerging slack** seen in some other regions\u2019 industrial/commercial markets.\n\n---\n## 5. Employment and Labor Market Conditions\n\n- **Chicago**  \n  **Employment was flat** over the reporting period. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015 \u2013 National Highlights by District > Chicago]\n\n- **United States / Other Districts**  \n  - The national Beige Book described labor markets as **mixed**, with many districts seeing **flat or modest employment gains** and some easing of earlier tightness.  \n  - Philadelphia, for example, reported **\u201cemployment levels increased slightly.\u201d** [Sub\u2011Query 4]\n\n- **Comparison**  \n  - Chicago: **no net employment growth (flat)**.  \n  - Some districts: **slight employment increases**.  \n  This implies that, at the margin, **Chicago\u2019s labor market momentum was weaker than in districts showing modest job gains**, but consistent with the overall national description that many areas were experiencing only small changes.\n\n---\n## 6. Wages\n\n- **Chicago**  \n  **Wages increased modestly.** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015 \u2013 Chicago]\n\n- **United States / Other Districts**  \n  Several districts reported **modest wage increases** and a cooling from earlier, more intense wage pressures. For instance, one district noted **\u201cwages again rose at modest pre\u2011pandemic rates.\u201d** [Sub\u2011Query 4]\n\n- **Comparison**  \n  Chicago\u2019s **modest wage growth** is **qualitatively similar** to the pattern seen in other districts: wage pressures remained present but **were not accelerating** and were often described as **modest** or **returning to pre\u2011pandemic norms**.\n\n---\n## 7. Prices / Inflation\n\n- **Chicago**  \n  \u201c**Prices rose moderately** in late August and September and contacts expected a **similar pace of growth over the next 12 months**.\u201d [Source: BeigeBook_20251015 \u2013 Chicago prices]\n\n- **United States / Other Districts**  \n  The national Beige Book summary and other district reports described price increases as **moderate or elevated but stable**:\n  - New York: \u201cThe pace of price increases remained **elevated but was little changed**.\u201d  \n  - Boston: \u201c**Prices increased at a moderate pace.**\u201d [Sub\u2011Query 3]\n\n- **Comparison**  \n  Chicago\u2019s inflation picture\u2014**moderate price increases with similar rates expected ahead**\u2014is **very much in line with national qualitative descriptions**. The Beige Book does not provide data to judge whether Chicago\u2019s inflation was above or below national averages; it does show that Chicago shared the broader theme of **moderate, not accelerating, price growth**.\n\n---\n## 8. Agriculture (Regional vs. National Context)\n\n- **Chicago**  \n  Agriculture is a key sector for the Seventh District. The Beige Book typically comments on **net farm income prospects** and **crop conditions**, but the specific October 2025 passages are not included in the supplied excerpts. We only know agriculture is one of the **key monitored indicators**. [Source: BeigeBook_20251015 \u2013 key indicators list]\n\n- **United States / Other Districts**  \n  Other agricultural districts (e.g., Kansas City, Dallas, Minneapolis) generally report on **farm incomes, commodity prices, and crop conditions**. For this particular report, no direct, comparable national agricultural details are in the excerpts provided.\n\n- **Comparison**  \n  Due to missing text for October 2025, **we cannot state how Chicago\u2019s agricultural conditions compared to national farm sectors**. Only the importance of agriculture as an indicator is clear.\n\n---\n## 9. Outlook / Expectations\n\n- **Chicago**  \n  Contacts **\u201cexpected a slight decrease in activity over the next year.\u201d** [Source: BeigeBook_20251015 \u2013 Chicago Summary]\n\n- **United States / Other Districts**  \n  Other districts\u2019 expectations vary, but detailed forward\u2011looking quotes for them are not in the excerpts you provided. The Beige Book in general notes that it covers both **current conditions and prospects**, but we lack specific national outlook language parallel to Chicago\u2019s. [Sub\u2011Query 3 & 4]\n\n- **Comparison**  \n  Chicago\u2019s one\u2011year outlook was **slightly negative** (expectation of a small decline), whereas some districts were experiencing **ongoing slight growth at the time**. Without explicit national outlook text, we can only say that **Chicago\u2019s sentiment appears more cautious** than regions where current activity and employment were still ticking up.\n\n---\n## 10. Summary: Chicago vs. National Patterns\n\n- **Areas where Chicago broadly matches national trends:**  \n  - **Consumer spending:** Modest increases, similar to Boston, New York, Richmond.  \n  - **Wages:** Modest wage growth, in line with other districts\u2019 reports of easing but ongoing wage gains.  \n  - **Prices:** Moderate price increases, similar to descriptions in Boston and New York.  \n  - **Construction/real estate:** Slight increases overall, with data\u2011center\u2011related nonresidential strength, consistent with themes in other districts.\n\n- **Areas where Chicago appears somewhat softer than at least some districts:**  \n  - **Overall activity:** Flat in Chicago vs **slight increases** in districts like Philadelphia.  \n  - **Employment:** Flat in Chicago vs **slightly rising** employment in some other regions.  \n  - **Business spending/investment:** Indications of **declining** business spending in Chicago, while some districts saw **slightly increasing** business activity.\n\n- **Areas where comparison is unclear due to limited evidence:**  \n  - **Agriculture:** Important in Chicago\u2019s district but no October 2025 detail available to compare against national farm conditions.  \n  - **Quantitative strength vs. the U.S. as a whole:** The Beige Book is **qualitative** and does not provide numerical growth or inflation rates, so any statement that Chicago was definitively \u201cslower than the nation overall\u201d would go beyond the evidence. We can only say it was **flat while some districts expanded slightly** and that its **outlook was mildly negative**.\n\nOverall, the October 15, 2025 Beige Book portrays the Chicago (Seventh) District as a region with **flat aggregate activity**, **modest consumer spending**, **flat employment**, **soft business investment**, **slight gains in construction/real estate (especially data centers)**, **modest wage growth**, and **moderate price increases**, with contacts expecting a **slight decline over the coming year**\u2014broadly aligned in character with national conditions but **less buoyant than some districts that were still recording slight growth in activity and employment.**",
