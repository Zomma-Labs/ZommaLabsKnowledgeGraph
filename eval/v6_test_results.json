      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "predicted": "From the available Beige Book information, we can describe the change over time mainly for the most recent reporting window and its comparison with the immediately preceding one.\n\n**Prior reporting period (preceding mid\u2011August 2025)**  \n- The Twelfth District (San Francisco) was at a **slightly higher overall level of economic activity** than in the later mid\u2011August\u2013September window; contacts\u2019 outlook was also **somewhat more optimistic**.  \n- **Agriculture and resource\u2011related sectors** were already **weakening slightly** in that earlier period, and this weakening **continued** into the next period. [The exact calendar dates of this prior period are not given in the October 15, 2025 Beige Book excerpt.]\n\n**Mid\u2011August to September 2025 reporting period**  \n(Source: Federal Reserve Beige Book, October 15, 2025, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.)\n\n- **Overall economic activity**  \n  - During **mid\u2011August through September 2025**, **overall economic activity in the Twelfth District edged down slightly** relative to that prior period.\n  - Contacts\u2019 **economic outlook weakened somewhat** compared with the earlier Beige Book cycle.\n\n- **Sector developments over this period**  \n  - **Retail trade**:  \n    - **Decreased somewhat** in this mid\u2011August\u2013September window compared with the prior period, contributing directly to the slight overall softening.\n  \n  - **Residential real estate**:  \n    - **Activity decreased somewhat** over mid\u2011August to September, a deterioration from the earlier reporting period.\n\n  - **Commercial real estate**:  \n    - Was **unchanged on balance** over mid\u2011August to September, indicating **no significant change** from the prior period.\n\n  - **Manufacturing and lending**:  \n    - Both **remained largely stable** during mid\u2011August\u2013September, implying **little or no change** from their earlier levels.\n\n  - **Consumer and business services**:  \n    - Conditions were **mixed** in the mid\u2011August\u2013September period, suggesting **no clear upward or downward trend**, but not improving enough to offset declines elsewhere.\n\n  - **Agriculture and resource\u2011related sectors**:  \n    - **Weakened slightly**, continuing the **slight weakening already present in the prior reporting period**.  \n    - The ongoing weakening was driven by:  \n      \u2022 **Falling foreign demand**, notably from **China**, amid trade policy changes and negotiations.  \n      \u2022 Generally **favorable weather** for yields but **heat waves and smoke from Pacific Northwest fires** that reduced fruit quality.  \n      \u2022 **Rising costs** for packaging and persistently **high financing costs**, combined with **low commodity prices**, straining producers\u2019 finances.  \n      \u2022 **Labor shortages** linked to immigration policy changes, holding down harvests and future investment plans.\n\n  - **Community support organizations and small businesses**:  \n    - **Conditions weakened modestly** during mid\u2011August\u2013September compared with the prior period, adding to the softening in overall activity.  \n    - The Beige Book excerpt does not specify which types of organizations or small-business industries were most affected.\n\n**Net change over time**  \n- **From the prior reporting period to mid\u2011August\u2013September 2025**, the Twelfth District moved from a slightly stronger footing to a position where **overall activity had edged down slightly**.  \n- The **deterioration was gradual rather than sharp**, driven mainly by:  \n  - New or continued **declines in retail trade and residential real estate**,  \n  - **Ongoing slight weakening in agriculture and resource\u2011related sectors**, and  \n  - **Modest weakening** among community support organizations and small businesses.  \n- At the same time, **commercial real estate, manufacturing, and lending remained broadly flat**, and **services were mixed**, so there was **no broad-based collapse**\u2014rather, a **gentle, sector-specific softening** over this mid\u2011August to September 2025 window relative to the immediately preceding Beige Book period.\n",
