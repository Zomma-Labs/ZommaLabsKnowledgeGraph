      "question": "What drove manufacturing demand in the Chicago District?",
      "expected": "Manufacturing demand declined modestly in late August and September. Steel orders were flat overall. Fabricated metals demand was unchanged on balance, as higher sales to a range of sectors was offset by lower sales to the construction and automotive industries. Machinery orders decreased moderately, driven by a decline in demand from the auto sector. Auto production was down modestly, while heavy truck production was flat.",
      "answer": "Manufacturing demand in the Chicago District (the Seventh Federal Reserve District as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago) was driven primarily by sector\u2011specific dynamics in autos, steel, and machinery, and by cost and labor\u2011market conditions. The findings point to the following drivers and their effects:\n\n1. **Auto industry weakness (downward pressure on demand)**  \n   - Multiple contacts reported **weakness among suppliers in the auto industry** in late August and September (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Banking and Finance).  \n   - **Auto production was down modestly** in late August and September (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing).  \n   - **Fabricated metals** producers reported **lower sales to the automotive industry**, which offset higher sales to other sectors (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing).  \n   Together, these indicate that slowing automotive activity reduced orders and demand for upstream manufactured inputs (e.g., fabricated metals, auto components).\n\n2. **Machinery and agricultural equipment (soft to weakening demand)**  \n   - **Machinery orders decreased moderately** in late August and September (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing), directly contributing to the observed **modest decline in overall manufacturing demand** in the District during that period.  \n   - A **state government contact** reported that **previously announced layoffs in agricultural machinery manufacturing would be weaker than last year** (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Labor Markets). This suggests expectations of **weaker agricultural machinery demand than the prior year**, though not as severe as initially anticipated.  \n   - Output growth for machinery more broadly was noted as having **abated** in durable goods manufacturing (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Manufacturing, cited in the cross\u2011District evidence), indicating a cooling in machinery\u2011related demand consistent with the Chicago District\u2019s reported decline in machinery orders.\n\n3. **Steel and reshoring (mixed, with some support for demand)**  \n   - **Steel orders were flat overall** in late August and September (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing), so steel demand did not contribute to growth but also did not decline.  \n   - **A few contacts reported some reshoring of steel production** in late August and September (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing). This reshoring represents a **supportive driver** for local steel\u2011related manufacturing activity, though the evidence characterizes it as limited (\u201ca few contacts\u201d), so its impact appears smaller relative to auto and machinery weakness.\n\n4. **Tariffs and input\u2011cost pressures (downward pressure via costs and demand)**  \n   - Chicago District **manufacturing contacts reported that metal prices had increased and attributed these increases to tariffs** (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Prices).  \n   - Across Districts, manufacturers reported **modest declines in demand for goods attributed to tariffs** (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Summary of Economic Activity), and auto manufacturers in another District reported **feeling the pinch from tariffs on new car sales and absorbing tariff\u2011related increases to prevent further demand declines** (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta > Prices).  \n   - For the Chicago District, the combination of **tariff\u2011driven metals price increases** and the broader pattern of **tariff\u2011related demand softness** is identified as a **macroeconomic headwind**: higher input costs for Chicago\u2011area manufacturers and weaker demand for tariff\u2011exposed goods (notably autos and metal\u2011intensive products).\n\n5. **Nonlabor input costs (headwind to profitability and pricing, indirectly weighing on demand)**  \n   - Contacts in the Chicago District highlighted **higher costs for energy and raw materials, including aluminum, copper, and steel** as part of a rise in **nonlabor input costs** (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Prices).  \n   - These cost increases, combined with tariff effects on metals, reduce margins and may constrain manufacturers\u2019 ability to price competitively, thereby **indirectly dampening demand** for some manufactured products.\n\n6. **Labor\u2011market conditions (softening labor demand reflecting weaker manufacturing activity)**  \n   - Contacts across many industries in the Chicago District observed **softening labor market conditions** (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Labor Markets).  \n   - An **employment placement agency** in the District reported a **continued decline in demand from manufacturers** (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Labor Markets).  \n   - This softening labor demand is more a **symptom than a cause**, but it reflects and reinforces **weaker underlying manufacturing demand**, as firms post fewer openings and potentially scale back production plans in response to slower orders.\n\n7. **Overall demand outcome and temporal characterization**  \n   - For the recent reporting period (late August and September), the Chicago Fed explicitly noted that **\u201cmanufacturing demand declined modestly\u201d** (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing).  \n   - Within that period:  \n     - **Machinery orders decreased moderately**,  \n     - **Steel orders were flat**, and  \n     - **Auto production and associated supplier activity were down modestly**,  \n     indicating that the **primary short\u2011run drivers of the modest decline** were sector\u2011specific slowdowns in **autos and machinery**, with steel roughly neutral and partially supported by limited reshoring.\n\n8. **Policy, infrastructure, and other factors**  \n   - The findings do **not** identify specific Chicago\u2011District policy measures (such as tax incentives or environmental regulations) or specific Great Lakes/port infrastructure elements as direct, documented drivers of manufacturing demand.  \n   - While separate evidence notes **robust intermodal rail freight volumes** (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta > Transportation), this is not tied explicitly to the Chicago District in the provided materials, so its role as a direct driver of Chicago\u2011area manufacturing demand is not established in the findings.\n\nIn sum, based on the provided evidence, manufacturing demand in the Chicago District was most directly driven downward by **weakness in the auto supply chain, moderating machinery orders and output, and tariff\u2011induced increases in metals and other input costs**, with **flat but partially reshored steel activity** providing limited offsetting support. Labor\u2011market softening and higher energy/raw\u2011material costs reflect and reinforce these demand pressures, and the net result in the latest period was a **modest decline in manufacturing demand**. The findings do not quantify precise magnitudes beyond characterizations such as \u201cmodestly\u201d or \u201cmoderately,\u201d nor do they provide a longer\u2011run time series beyond this recent reporting window.",

      "reasoning": "The expected answer is a specific summary of what happened to manufacturing demand and its key subsectors (steel flat; fabricated metals unchanged overall with higher sales to some sectors offset by lower construction/auto; machinery orders down due to weaker auto demand; auto production down modestly; heavy truck production flat). The agent correctly includes several of these core points: overall manufacturing demand declined modestly; steel orders were flat; machinery orders decreased moderately; auto production was down modestly; and fabricated metals had lower sales to autos offsetting other strength. However, the agent adds a lot of extra, unsupported drivers (tariffs, input costs, labor market conditions, reshoring) that are not part of the expected answer, and it omits key expected facts: that fabricated metals were also offset by lower construction sales, and that heavy truck production was flat. It also does not clearly state that machinery weakness was driven by reduced demand from the auto sector (it implies it, but not as directly/cleanly as expected).",

      "question": "How did tariffs affect prices across districts?",
      "expected": "Tariff-induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts, but the extent of those higher costs passing through to final prices varied. Some firms kept selling prices unchanged to preserve market share, while others fully passed higher import costs to customers.",
      "answer": "Across Federal Reserve Districts, the available evidence shows that tariffs raised input costs and contributed to higher prices, but the magnitude and timing of pass-through differed by sector and firm:\n\n- **Direct cost effects of tariffs by District:**\n  - In the **San Francisco District**, \u201chigher import duties increased the cost of imported supplies, including raw materials, electrical and electronic components, and food,\u201d and \u201cmany suppliers absorbed some of the price increases resulting from higher import duties,\u201d while retailers passed \u201ca sizable portion of the upstream cost and price increases on to consumers, mostly in the mid to high-end markets.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Prices)\n  - In the **Dallas (Eleventh) District**, \u201ctariffs contributed to sharper selling price increases in the manufacturing sector.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Prices)\n  - In the **Boston District**, \u201ctariffs were linked to further increases in consumer prices,\u201d and \u201csmaller manufacturers experienced tariff-induced cost increases\u201d and \u201cpassed through a larger share of tariff-induced cost increases to customers over the period discussed.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Community Perspectives; Boston > Prices)\n  - In the **Richmond District**, \u201cfirms cited tariffs as a factor associated with the pickup in price growth in manufacturing during the period covered,\u201d while \u201csome tariff-driven increases in input costs had not yet been passed along to customers.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond > Summary of Economic Activity; Richmond > Prices)\n  - In the **Atlanta (Sixth) District**, \u201ccontacts warned that price passthrough resulting from tariffs had just begun,\u201d firms \u201cwere passing through tariff-related cost increases to customers,\u201d and \u201ccontacts expected that prices would continue to rise into 2026 due to ongoing tariff-related passthrough.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta > Prices, ConsumerSpending, Summary of Economic Activity)\n  - In the **Cleveland District**, retail contacts reported that \u201ctariffs had driven cost increases\u201d on specific goods such as coffee, chocolate, beef, and that \u201ctwo contacts reported that foreign producers were factoring in tariffs when setting their prices,\u201d including both raising prices and cutting prices to retain market share. (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Prices)\n  - In **Chicago**, \u201cthe price increases by smaller retailers because of tariffs would affect consumers, since these are consumer-facing firms.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Prices)\n\n- **General price dynamics within Districts:**\n  - Multiple District reports document that prices were rising at least modestly or moderately over the same periods tariffs were in effect, with the District as the geographic unit:\n    - **Minneapolis District:** \u201cPrices increased modestly over the reporting period in the District,\u201d with various commodity prices (e.g., hogs, cattle, turkeys, canola, sunflowers) rising from a year earlier, and input price pressures greater than overall price increases. (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis > Prices)\n    - **New York (Second) District:** \u201cSelling prices in the Second Federal Reserve District rose moderately\u201d and \u201ccontinued to rise moderately in the District,\u201d while \u201cinput prices again rose strongly.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of New York > Summary of Economic Activity; New York > Prices)\n    - **Atlanta (Sixth) District:** \u201cPrices in the Sixth District increased moderately\u201d and \u201cat a moderate pace during the period described.\u201d (Atlanta > Body; Atlanta > SummaryofEconomicActivity)\n    - **Cleveland (Fourth) District:** \u201cFourth District contacts reported that selling prices continued to grow modestly.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > SummaryofEconomicActivity)\n    - **Chicago District:** \u201cPrices rose moderately in late August and September.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Prices)\n    - Other area-level reports (e.g., Philadelphia, St. Louis, San Francisco areas) similarly note moderate price increases. (Philadelphia > Body; St. Louis > Body; San Francisco > Body)\n\n- **Mechanism and cross-district variation:**\n  - Across the reports, tariffs are consistently described as raising firms\u2019 input costs, with \u201ctariff-induced input cost increases\u201d being **partially passed through** to final prices. The \u201cextent to which tariff-induced input cost increases were passed through to final prices varied across firms and markets.\u201d (Prices > Body)\n  - Some Districts and sectors show **more complete and quicker pass-through** (e.g., smaller manufacturers in Boston; manufacturing in Dallas; firms in Atlanta expecting continued tariff-driven price increases), whereas other contacts report **incomplete or delayed pass-through** (e.g., Richmond noting some tariff-driven cost increases not yet passed along).\n  - In several Districts, firms actively adjusted pricing strategies around tariffs: in New York, a major retailer \u201cadjusted price increases based on the demand elasticity of each item in the context of tariff-related pricing strategies\u201d; in Philadelphia, \u201csome suppliers raised prices while citing tariffs as justification, even if their goods were not subject to increased levies.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of New York > Prices; Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia > Prices)\n\n- **Limits of the evidence for district-by-district quantification:**\n  - The findings do not provide a unified, quantitative estimate of how much tariffs raised prices in each District or allow precise comparisons across Districts.\n  - The evidence is descriptive, at the level of Federal Reserve Districts and sectors, rather than product-level or HS-code-linked data.\n\nWithin these constraints, the findings indicate that tariffs raised input costs and contributed to higher prices in multiple Federal Reserve Districts, with the strength and timing of the effect differing across Districts, sectors, and firms depending on how much of the tariff-induced cost increase was passed through into final prices.",

      "answer": "Trade-related concerns affected the agriculture sector unevenly across the Federal Reserve Districts, primarily through weaker export demand and tariff\u2011related price and cost pressures, with sharper impacts in crop\u2011heavy areas.\n\n1. **Channels of impact from trade concerns**\n\n   - Across districts, **trade policy volatility and export market loss** weighed on agricultural exports (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta).  \n   - In the **Chicago District**, the **absence of new\u2011crop soybean exports to China** was specifically linked to **lower soybean prices in the District** (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago).  \n   - In the **Minneapolis District**, agricultural contacts were **concerned about the elimination of Chinese purchases of soybeans** (Minneapolis), indicating exposure to the same export-market shock.  \n   - Tariffs and higher import duties **raised costs for food and other inputs**, as:\n     - \u201cTariffs were linked to further increases in consumer prices\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston).  \n     - \u201cHigher import duties increased the cost of imported supplies, including \u2026 food\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco).  \n     - Retail contacts reported tariffs **drove cost increases on beef, coffee, and chocolate** (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland).  \n   - Foreign producers adjusted prices in response to tariffs, with some **factoring tariffs into their prices** and others **cutting prices to retain market share** (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland), affecting competitive conditions faced by domestic agricultural producers.\n\n2. **Resulting agriculture outcomes by district/region**\n\n   - **Chicago District**  \n     - Agriculture \u201cwas reported to be in good shape across most of the District,\u201d but **soybean prices were lower in part due to the absence of new\u2011crop soybean exports to China**, and **corn prices were down despite strong export volumes** (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago).  \n     - This indicates that trade-related concerns (China soybean export loss, broader trade volatility) translated into **lower crop prices**, even amid otherwise solid production conditions.\n\n   - **Minneapolis District (Ninth District)**  \n     - **Production/yields:** Corn production in District states was expected to **set new records**, and **soybean harvests were very strong** (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis).  \n     - **Prices:** Within this District, prices for **sunflowers, canola, hogs, cattle, and turkeys** increased from a year earlier, while **soybeans, wheat, hay, pulse crops, and chickens** saw price declines (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis).  \n     - **Trade linkage:** Contacts were **concerned about the elimination of Chinese purchases of soybeans** (Minneapolis), mirroring the Chicago District\u2019s China\u2011related demand shock.  \n     - **Income and employment:** Producer incomes in the Minneapolis District were **weighed down by low crop prices and elevated expenses**, and overall **employment in the District was down slightly** with surveys finding **declining headcount among employers** (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis).  \n     - Together, these indicate that **trade\u2011driven weakness in key crop prices (notably soybeans)** contributed to **financial strain for farmers** despite strong yields.\n\n   - **Kansas City District (Tenth District)**  \n     - A survey found **over 80% of lenders in crop\u2011heavy areas** (versus about **40% in more cattle\u2011producing areas**) reported **declines in both farm income and working capital** (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City).  \n     - These patterns were attributed to **exposure to policy shocks contributing to shifts in market shares among competitors in the Tenth District** (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City).  \n     - This implies that **district areas more dependent on traded crops were more negatively affected**\u2014via lower income and tighter working capital\u2014than areas focused on cattle production.\n\n   - **St. Louis District**  \n     - Contacts reported that **government support will be a critical lifeline for many farmers in the District** (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis).  \n     - While the St. Louis evidence does not explicitly tie this need to trade concerns, it aligns with the broader pattern in crop\u2011heavy regions where **weak commodity prices and trade\u2011related export uncertainty** heightened financial stress.\n\n   - **Dallas District (Eleventh District)**  \n     - In the agriculture sector, **production and yields were generally coming in strong**, indicating **robust output conditions** (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas).  \n     - The findings do not explicitly tie Dallas District agriculture outcomes to trade concerns; instead, agriculture outlooks there were weighed down by **the spread of New World screwworm** (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas).  \n     - Thus, for this District, the research indicates **strong production with pressures driven more by non\u2011trade factors**, based on the cited evidence.\n\n   - **Atlanta District (Sixth District)**  \n     - \u201cTrade policy volatility weighed on agricultural exports\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta), and **Chinese markets turned to Brazil for commodities such as soybean, wheat, and corn** (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta).  \n     - Domestic demand for **beef, poultry, peanuts, and tobacco** was strong (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta), suggesting that within this District, **export\u2011oriented crop producers were more exposed to negative trade shocks**, while producers serving strong domestic markets fared better.\n\n   - **San Francisco District (Twelfth District)**  \n     - Higher import duties **increased the cost of imported supplies, including food** (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco), and **producers continued to experience financial strain due to conditions in commodities and a recent heat wave** (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco).  \n     - The findings attribute part of the strain to **commodity conditions**, which are influenced by trade\u2011related price dynamics, but do not specify a commodity\u2011 or export\u2011market\u2011level linkage as clearly as in the Chicago and Minneapolis Districts.\n\n3. **Cross\u2011district comparative pattern**\n\n   - **Where trade concerns were most directly tied to specific export losses (e.g., soybeans to China in Chicago and Minneapolis), agriculture saw:**\n     - **Lower prices for key crops** (soybeans, and also wheat, hay, and pulse crops in Minneapolis).  \n     - **Producer incomes weighed down by low crop prices** (Minneapolis).  \n     - **Increased concern among agricultural contacts** about export\u2011market elimination (Minneapolis, Chicago).  \n   - **In crop\u2011heavy areas of the Kansas City District**, exposure to **policy shocks and shifting market shares** was associated with **widespread declines in farm income and working capital**, much more than in cattle\u2011heavy areas (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City).  \n   - Across multiple districts, **tariffs and higher import duties increased food and input costs**, and foreign producers\u2019 pricing responses to tariffs altered competitive conditions (Boston, Cleveland, San Francisco), adding **cost pressures** on top of **weaker export demand**.\n   - At the same time, **overall agricultural production and yields remained strong in several districts** (Dallas; Minneapolis corn and soybeans; Chicago agriculture \u201cin good shape\u201d), so the adverse effect of trade\u2011related concerns manifested **primarily through prices, incomes, and financial conditions rather than through reduced output**.\n\nIn sum, the findings indicate that trade-related concerns\u2014especially trade policy volatility, tariffs, and the loss of key export markets like China for soybeans\u2014produced **district\u2011level declines in crop prices, farm incomes, and working capital**, with **more severe impacts in crop\u2011heavy districts and areas** (Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City) than in regions less reliant on vulnerable export crops or more focused on livestock, even as production itself often remained robust.",

      "answer": "Supply chain disruptions affecting manufacturing, and their production impacts, were as follows (all attribution in parentheses):\n\n1. Types of disruptions and causes\n\n- Labor shortages  \n  - Manufacturing contacts reported labor shortages because workers were not reporting to work due to fears of deportation (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Labor Markets).  \n  - Difficulties finding enough labor led to labor shortfalls in related resource industries (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries).\n\n- Geopolitical/tariff-related disruptions  \n  - Tariffs were repeatedly cited as a headwind for manufacturing and related services (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Manufacturing and Related Services).  \n  - Firms faced higher import duties on raw materials, electrical and electronic components, and food, raising input costs (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Prices).  \n  - A computer manufacturer reported that U.S. customs was applying steel and aluminum tariffs even to products that did not contain these metals (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Prices).  \n  - Many businesses sought alternative inputs from vendors to mitigate tariff cost impacts (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Prices).\n\n- Rising input and energy costs  \n  - Costs for imported semiconductor chips used in manufacturing increased (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Manufacturing).  \n  - Utilities costs for manufacturing and manufacturers\u2019 utilities costs in general rose (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Manufacturing; Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Prices).  \n  - Nonlabor input costs rose robustly, including energy and raw materials such as aluminum, copper, and steel (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Prices; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Prices).  \n  - A manufacturing firm described raw material costs as moving from a \u201cboil\u201d to a \u201csimmer\u201d through 2025, indicating still-elevated but moderating pressures (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Manufacturing and Other Business Activity).\n\n- Production/operations-related disruptions  \n  - Unplanned outages caused a dip in production levels at Gulf Coast refineries (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Manufacturing).  \n  - Firms built multiple facilities across regions to offset shipping and logistics costs, and some shipped unfinished goods to the U.S. for final assembly to manage tariffs, shipping, and labor dynamics (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Manufacturing).  \n  - An apparel company offshored manufacturing to the Caribbean because of labor challenges (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Manufacturing).\n\n- Demand- and policy-related headwinds  \n  - Tariffs were directly linked to modest declines in demand for manufactured goods (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Summary of Economic Activity).  \n  - Domestic policy uncertainty and inflation weighed on manufacturing outlooks (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Manufacturing).  \n\nSome reports explicitly noted that materials availability itself was generally adequate despite these other disruptions (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Manufacturing).\n\n\n2. Affected manufacturing sectors/industries\n\n- Automotive  \n  - Auto production was down modestly in late August and September (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Manufacturing).  \n  - Weaknesses among suppliers were reported in the auto industry (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Banking and Finance).  \n  - Some auto manufacturers felt tariff \u201cpinch\u201d on new car sales and in some cases absorbed tariff-related cost increases to avoid further demand declines (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Prices).\n\n- Machinery and transportation-related durable goods  \n  - Output growth abated for machinery within durable goods manufacturing (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Manufacturing).  \n  - Machinery orders decreased moderately, driven by weaker demand from the automotive industry (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Manufacturing).  \n  - Output growth abated for transportation-related durable goods (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Manufacturing).\n\n- Electronics/automated manufacturing  \n  - Costs for imported semiconductor chips used in manufacturing increased (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Manufacturing).  \n  - Automated manufacturers reported increased excess capacity (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Manufacturing).\n\n- Chemicals and refining  \n  - Gulf Coast refineries experienced a dip in production levels due in part to unplanned outages (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Manufacturing).  \n  - Basic chemicals exporters faced downward pressure on export demand (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Manufacturing).\n\n- Food processing and protein-related businesses  \n  - Labor was described as the main constraint to expansion for protein businesses (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Agriculture and Natural Resources).  \n  - Related retail food channels showed very lean staffing, with grocery stores reduced to \u201cskeleton crews\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Worker Experience).\n\n- General manufacturing and related services  \n  - Manufacturing and related services cited tariffs and general uncertainty as headwinds (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Manufacturing and Related Services).  \n  - Manufacturing activity \u201cdipped\u201d in several districts and demand for goods declined modestly (Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas, Chicago, Cleveland, various Manufacturing/Summary reports).\n\n\n3. Nature of production impact\n\n- Decreased output/volume and excess capacity  \n  - Manufacturing activity \u201cdipped\u201d in the period described (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Manufacturing).  \n  - Output growth abated for most durable goods, with specific mentions for machinery and transportation-related durable goods (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Manufacturing).  \n  - Auto production was down modestly in late August and September (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Manufacturing).  \n  - Gulf Coast refinery production levels dipped due to unplanned outages (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Manufacturing).  \n  - Automated manufacturers reported higher levels of excess capacity as demand softened (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Manufacturing).\n\n- Demand declines linked to disruptions  \n  - Manufacturers reported modest demand declines for goods and attributed these directly to tariffs (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Summary of Economic Activity).  \n  - Manufacturing demand declined modestly in late August and September more broadly (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Manufacturing).  \n  - New orders for manufactured goods were down (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Prices).\n\n- Increased production costs  \n  - Higher import duties increased costs for imported supplies, including raw materials and electronic components (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Prices).  \n  - Costs for imported semiconductor chips and utilities used in manufacturing rose (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Manufacturing).  \n  - Nonlabor input costs, including energy and metals, increased at a robust pace (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Prices; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Prices).  \n  - Manufacturers responded by introducing price increases to cover elevated input costs (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Prices; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Prices; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Prices).  \n  - Tariffs contributed to sharper selling price increases in manufacturing (Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Prices).\n\n- Labor-related production constraints and employment adjustments  \n  - Labor shortages in manufacturing (including absences due to deportation fears) constrained operations (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Labor Markets).  \n  - One manufacturer delayed, then ultimately proceeded with workforce cuts/layoffs while waiting for industrial production to recover (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Labor Markets).  \n  - Another manufacturer postponed layoffs initially, then noted it could not delay them any longer (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Labor Markets).  \n  - Some manufacturing firms added workers to meet demand, while others held or reduced headcounts, leaving aggregate manufacturing employment unchanged (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Labor Markets).  \n  - A manufacturer planned to continue hiring into 2026, suggesting ongoing labor-related adjustments (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Labor Markets).  \n  - In food-related sectors, labor constraints limited expansion (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Agriculture and Natural Resources; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Worker Experience).\n\n- Planning difficulties and operational changes  \n  - Manufacturing and related services contacts had challenges making production and pricing plans amid increased demand from medical, retail, and wholesale sectors and tariff-related uncertainty (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Manufacturing and Related Services).  \n  - Firms reconfigured supply chains\u2014offshoring apparel production, splitting production across multiple facilities, and shifting unfinished goods to the U.S. for final assembly\u2014to manage tariffs, shipping, and labor issues (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Manufacturing).  \n\n- Prices and product-market effects  \n  - Manufacturers and wholesalers raised selling prices to offset elevated input costs (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Prices).  \n  - Some auto manufacturers chose to absorb tariff-related cost increases to avoid further demand declines (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Prices).  \n  - Firms in several districts cited tariffs as a factor behind rising manufacturing prices (Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas, Richmond, Philadelphia, various Prices/Summary reports).\n\nWhere the research is explicit on causality, tariffs and higher import duties are directly tied to modest declines in manufacturing demand, dips in activity, and higher production costs, while labor shortages and unplanned outages are tied to capacity constraints and localized production dips. The findings do not specify quantitative magnitudes beyond descriptors such as \u201cmodest,\u201d \u201cdipped,\u201d or \u201cabated,\u201d and they generally do not provide detailed data on inventory swings or specific factory closure counts.",

Consumers are \u201cincreasingly focused on finding value,\u201d \u201clooking for ways to stretch their dollars,\u201d and \u201cactively seeking deals\u201d (Minneapolis).\n     - Tenants and shoppers in malls are described as looking for \u201cvalue, deals, and ways to stretch their dollars\u201d (Minneapolis).\n     - Some retailers respond by discounting select items instead of broad price hikes (Cleveland), indicating price sensitivity and targeted value strategies.\n   - **Impact of inflation and eroded purchasing power:**\n     - Contacts report that \u201cinflation is eroding consumer purchasing power\u201d (St. Louis, repeated in multiple references).\n     - Low\u2011 and moderate\u2011income households are \u201ctaking steps to reduce spending where possible\u201d (Boston).\n     - Overall, \u201cconsumer spending, particularly for retail goods, inched down in recent weeks\u201d (overall activity; Kansas City, St. Louis).\n   - **Pullback in discretionary and some staples:**\n     - Clothing and travel-related retail spending show notable softening (San Francisco, Chicago).\n     - At restaurants, diners are \u201cpulling back by skipping alcoholic beverages\u201d (Atlanta), consistent with selective cutbacks in more discretionary components of consumption.\n   - **Reduced foot traffic and margin pressure:**\n     - Retail, hospitality, and tourism firms face \u201clower foot traffic\u201d and \u201cincreasing pressure on margins\u201d (Minneapolis).\n     - Slower foot traffic in tourist destinations contributes directly to lower travel-related retail spending (San Francisco).\n\n2. **Categories with gains or relative strength**\n\n   In contrast, certain categories show continued strong or resilient performance:\n\n   - **Luxury goods and high\u2011end retail:**\n     - \u201cRetail sales of luxury goods continued to perform well\u201d (San Francisco).\n     - The \u201cluxury end of the retail market in Manhattan remained particularly resilient\u201d (New York).\n     - A major department store\u2019s stronger sales were attributed partly to \u201cresilience among mid\u2011 to upper\u2011income consumers\u201d (New York).\n   - **Athletic footwear:**\n     - \u201cRetail sales of athletic footwear continued to perform well\u201d (San Francisco).\n   - **Selected services and experiences:**\n     - Corporate clients \u201ccontinue to spend on travel, events, and luxury services despite the slight overall decline in consumer spending\u201d (St. Louis).\n     - Consumer spending increased at restaurants in the \u201cfast food, fast casual, and family dining segments\u201d (Chicago).\n     - Demand from restaurant groups for real estate remained \u201csolid\u201d (Chicago).\n     - Food services providers had \u201cvery strong demand\u201d for certain items such as dairy, described as \u201con fire,\u201d while retail dairy sales were \u201cstable\u201d (Atlanta).\n\n   **Consumer behavior patterns linked to these gains:**\n\n   - **Bifurcation by income:**\n     - The New York Fed notes that part of the increase in consumer spending reflects the \u201cresilience of mid\u2011 to upper\u2011income households.\u201d\n     - Retailers passed a \u201csizable portion\u201d of upstream cost and price increases on to consumers \u201cmostly in the mid\u2011 to high\u2011end markets\u201d (San Francisco), implying that higher\u2011income consumers are absorbing higher prices more readily.\n   - **Resilience in premium and luxury segments:**\n     - Continued strong performance of luxury goods (San Francisco) and resilience of luxury retail in Manhattan (New York) show that premium segments are less affected by inflation\u2011driven cutbacks.\n     - Ongoing spending on \u201ctravel, events, and luxury services\u201d by corporate and higher\u2011income clients (St. Louis) further underscores robust demand for high\u2011end experiences even as overall spending softens.\n   - **Selective spending on convenience and dining out:**\n     - Increased spending at fast food, fast casual, and family dining restaurants (Chicago) indicates consumers directing spend toward relatively affordable or convenient food\u2011away\u2011from\u2011home options.\n     - Strong demand for certain foodservice inputs like dairy (Atlanta) aligns with this restaurant strength, even as some packaged retail food/snack volumes soften (Atlanta).\n\n3. **How gains vs. declines reflect overall consumer behavior patterns**\n\n   Bringing the category performance and behavior patterns together, the findings describe:\n\n   - **Broad softening in many goods categories** (food, beverages, clothing, pet supplies, electronics, appliances, building materials, furniture, packaged snacks) that aligns with:\n     - Inflation\u2011driven erosion of purchasing power (St. Louis and others),\n     - Strong value\u2011seeking and deal\u2011hunting behavior (Minneapolis),\n     - Active efforts by low\u2011 and moderate\u2011income households to cut spending (Boston),\n     - Targeted discounts and selective price increases by retailers (Cleveland, San Francisco, New York).\n\n   - **Relative strength in luxury, premium, and some service-oriented categories** (luxury goods, luxury services, athletic footwear, fast food/fast casual/family dining, some restaurant\u2011related real estate), reflecting:\n     - Spending resilience among mid\u2011 to upper\u2011income consumers (New York),\n     - Willingness of higher\u2011income segments to accept price pass\u2011through in mid\u2011 to high\u2011end markets (San Francisco),\n     - Prioritization of experiences and premium offerings by those less constrained by inflation (St. Louis, New York, San Francisco).\n\n   - **Mixed picture in travel and hospitality:**\n     - Some softness in travel\u2011related categories such as airlines, hotels, and tourist\u2011area retail (Chicago, San Francisco, Minneapolis),\n     - Simultaneous strong spending on corporate travel, events, and luxury services (St. Louis),\n     indicating that travel and experiences remain important for higher\u2011spending segments, while broader consumer constraints and lower foot traffic suppress volume elsewhere.\n\nIn summary, categories tied to everyday goods and many durables are experiencing declines, driven by inflation\u2011induced value\u2011seeking, reduced discretionary spend among lower\u2011 and moderate\u2011income households, and weaker foot traffic. At the same time, luxury goods, athletic footwear, and several premium or convenience\u2011oriented service categories are holding up or growing, supported by resilient mid\u2011 to upper\u2011income consumers who continue to spend on premium products, dining, and high\u2011end experiences.",
