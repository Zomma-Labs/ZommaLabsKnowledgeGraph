      "question": "What was the economic activity in the Seventh District (Chicago)?",
      "expected": "Economic activity in the Seventh District was little changed over the reporting period. Consumer spending declined some; construction and real estate activity increased slightly; employment was flat; business spending declined slightly; and manufacturing demand declined modestly.",
      "got": "Economic activity in the Seventh Federal Reserve District (Chicago) was reported as follows:\n\n- **Overall activity:** Economic activity in the Seventh District was \u201clittle changed\u201d over the reporting period, with contacts indicating that conditions \u201csoftened slightly\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Summary of Economic Activity).\n\n- **Labor market:** Contacts across many industries \u201cobserved softening labor market conditions\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Labor Markets). The findings do not provide specific figures on employment or unemployment.\n\n- **Wages:** The findings do not report a specific wage-growth characterization for the Seventh District; available wage descriptions (e.g., \u201cmodest\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d growth) are drawn from other Federal Reserve districts and cannot be attributed to the Seventh District based on the evidence provided.\n\n- **Prices:** \u201cPrices rose moderately in late August and September and contacts expected a similar pace of growth over the next 12 months.\u201d Nonlabor input costs (notably energy and metals such as aluminum, copper, and steel) also \u201crose moderately,\u201d and overall producer and consumer prices \u201crose moderately\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Prices).\n\n- **Manufacturing:** The Chicago Fed reported on manufacturing conditions (demand, orders, sales, production), and overall District contacts reported that activity \u201csoftened slightly\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing; Summary of Economic Activity). The findings do not give more detailed sector metrics for manufacturing in the Seventh District.\n\n- **Services, construction, and real estate:** The research does not contain Seventh-District-specific statements on services or on construction/real estate; examples cited in the research for these sectors come from other Federal Reserve districts and therefore cannot be applied to the Seventh District based on the available evidence.\n\n- **Agriculture:** \u201cProspects for 2025 farm income were unchanged in the Seventh District over the reporting period\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Summary of Economic Activity). Separately, \u201cagriculture in the District was reported to be in good shape across most of the District\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Agriculture).\n\nIn sum, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\u2019s reporting, the Seventh District\u2019s economy was roughly flat with slight softening, characterized by softening labor market conditions, moderate price increases and input-cost pressures, and generally stable but \u201cin good shape\u201d agricultural conditions with unchanged farm income prospects.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer specifies multiple sector details: consumer spending declined some; construction/real estate increased slightly; employment was flat; business spending declined slightly; and manufacturing demand declined modestly, alongside overall activity being little changed. The agent correctly states overall activity was little changed, but it does not provide the required specific sector movements (consumer spending, construction/real estate, business spending, manufacturing demand) and does not state employment was flat. Instead, it adds other information (prices, wages, agriculture) and claims the research lacks sector-specific statements, which contradicts the expected summary.",

      "question": "How did financial conditions change in the Chicago District?",
      "expected": "Financial conditions loosened slightly in late August and September. Bond and equity values rose a bit, while volatility remained unchanged. Business loan demand decreased slightly on net, with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity.",
      "got": "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, overall financial conditions in the Chicago (Seventh) District **loosened slightly in late August and September**.\n\nMore specifically (all for late August and September, per the Chicago Fed\u2019s banking and finance commentary):\n\n- **Overall conditions:**  \n  - \u201cOverall financial conditions loosened slightly.\u201d\n\n- **Consumer lending:**  \n  - **Loan demand**: \u201cConsumer loan demand increased slightly.\u201d  \n  - **Loan rates**: \u201cConsumer loan rates edged down.\u201d  \n  - **Loan terms**: \u201cConsumer loan terms tightened slightly.\u201d  \n  - **Loan quality**: \u201cConsumer loan quality remained flat.\u201d\n\n- **Business lending:**  \n  - **Loan rates**: \u201cBusiness loan rates moved down.\u201d  \n  - **Loan terms**: \u201cBusiness loan terms tightened.\u201d  \n  - **Loan quality**: \u201cBusiness loan quality declined modestly.\u201d\n\n- **Financial markets:**  \n  - \u201cFinancial market volatility remained unchanged.\u201d\n\nIn summary, the Chicago Fed reported that despite some tightening of loan terms and modest deterioration in business loan quality, slightly higher consumer loan demand and lower loan rates led to a **slight loosening of overall financial conditions** in the District over this period.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The agent correctly states that financial conditions loosened slightly and that volatility was unchanged. However, it misses two key elements of the expected answer: that bond and equity values rose a bit, and that business loan demand decreased slightly on net (with one contact citing reduced acquisition activity). The agent instead discusses consumer loan demand increasing and does not address the expected points about asset prices and business loan demand decline/acquisition activity.",

      "question": "What were the conditions in the agriculture sector?",
      "expected": "Agriculture conditions were mixed across reporting Districts. In St. Louis, agriculture conditions are strained and have further deteriorated. In Chicago, crops were in good shape across most of the District, though soybean prices were lower due to absence of new-crop exports to China. In Atlanta, overall demand for agricultural products was healthy. Minneapolis agricultural contacts were concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases.",
      "got": "Conditions in the agriculture sector were mixed and highly regional, with notable stress in crop-heavy areas and relatively stronger conditions for livestock producers.\n\n1. **Overall conditions and regional differences**\n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that agriculture conditions in its District were \u201cstrained\u201d and had \u201cfurther deteriorated\u201d (St. Louis \u2013 Agriculture and Natural Resources; Summary of Economic Activity). Contacts there indicated that government support would be a \u201ccritical lifeline\u201d for many farmers (St. Louis \u2013 Agriculture and Natural Resources).\n   * The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis reported that agricultural conditions in the Ninth District had \u201cweakened\u201d since the previous report, and producer incomes were weighed down by low crop prices and elevated expenses (Minneapolis \u2013 Summary of Economic Activity; Agriculture, Energy, and Natural Resources).\n   * By contrast, the Chicago Fed reported that agriculture in its District was \u201cin good shape across most of the District\u201d (Chicago \u2013 Agriculture), and prospects for 2025 farm income were unchanged in the Seventh District (Chicago \u2013 Summary of Economic Activity).\n   * The Atlanta Fed noted that agriculture conditions in the Sixth District were \u201cmostly healthy\u201d (Atlanta \u2013 Summary of Economic Activity).\n   * The Dallas Fed reported that in its District, agricultural production and yields were \u201cgenerally coming in strong,\u201d and many cotton growers expected their best cotton harvest in three to four years (Dallas \u2013 Agriculture).\n   * The Kansas City Fed indicated that conditions were \u201cconsiderably stronger for cattle producers\u201d compared with other parts of the sector (Kansas City \u2013 Agriculture).\n\n2. **Farm income, profitability, and prices**\n   * A Kansas City Fed survey found that over 80% of lenders in crop\u2011heavy areas reported declines in both farm income and working capital, versus about 40% of lenders in areas with more cattle production (Kansas City \u2013 Agriculture). This indicates much greater financial pressure in crop-focused regions.\n   * The Dallas Fed reported that grain and cotton prices remained \u201csub\u2011profitable,\u201d meaning prices were too low to be considered profitable (Dallas \u2013 Agriculture).\n   * The Minneapolis Fed noted that producer incomes in its District were weighed down by \u201clow crop prices\u201d and elevated expenses (Minneapolis \u2013 Agriculture, Energy, and Natural Resources).\n   * The Atlanta Fed reported that corn and soybean remained \u201cdepressed\u201d (Atlanta \u2013 Energy).\n   * In contrast, livestock prices were stronger:\n     * The Kansas City Fed stated that conditions were considerably stronger for cattle producers (Kansas City \u2013 Agriculture).\n     * The Chicago Fed reported cattle prices in its District had increased to \u201crecord territory\u201d (Chicago \u2013 Agriculture).\n     * The Minneapolis Fed reported that commodity prices for cattle and hogs had increased from a year earlier (Minneapolis \u2013 Prices).\n\n3. **Input costs and operational pressures**\n   * The Cleveland Fed reported a \u201crobust recent increase in nonlabor input costs,\u201d continuing an earlier trend in chemical input costs; wholesalers raised prices to cover elevated input costs (Cleveland \u2013 Prices).\n   * The Minneapolis Fed reported that input prices faced \u201cincreased pressures\u201d and that elevated expenses weighed on producer incomes (Minneapolis \u2013 Body; Agriculture, Energy, and Natural Resources).\n   * The San Francisco Fed noted that input costs were higher in recent weeks, including for utilities and imported components (San Francisco \u2013 Manufacturing).\n   * The Chicago Fed highlighted concerns about higher input costs for 2026 (Chicago \u2013 Agriculture).\n\n4. **Credit conditions and financial stress**\n   * The Kansas City Fed reported that agricultural credit conditions \u201cdeteriorated\u201d in the period described (Kansas City \u2013 Agriculture) and that farmer sentiment was \u201cweak\u201d (Kansas City \u2013 Agriculture).\n   * In the same survey, over 80% of lenders in crop\u2011heavy areas and about 40% of lenders in more cattle\u2011intensive areas reported declines in farm income and working capital (Kansas City \u2013 Agriculture), underscoring broad but uneven financial stress.\n   * The St. Louis Fed described agriculture in its District as \u201cstrained\u201d and having further deteriorated; weak agricultural conditions were also noted as negatively impacting rural housing markets (St. Louis \u2013 Agriculture and Natural Resources; Real Estate and Construction).\n   * The San Francisco Fed reported producers experiencing \u201cfinancial strain\u201d due to commodity conditions and a recent heat wave (San Francisco \u2013 Agriculture and Resource\u2011Related Industries).\n   * The San Francisco Fed also noted some increases in loan delinquencies affecting borrowers (San Francisco \u2013 Community Conditions). The findings do not specify a direct link to agriculture-specific bankruptcies, and there is no explicit evidence in the provided data of increased farm bankruptcies.\n\n5. **Production, weather, and labor**\n   * The Minneapolis Fed reported \u201cvery strong\u201d soybean harvests and expected record corn production in District states (Minneapolis \u2013 Agriculture, Energy, and Natural Resources), even as low prices limited incomes.\n   * The Dallas Fed reported that production and yields in its District\u2019s agriculture sector were \u201cgenerally coming in strong\u201d (Dallas \u2013 Agriculture).\n   * The San Francisco Fed reported that a recent heat wave put additional financial strain on producers and that labor shortfalls reduced harvests in some cases (San Francisco \u2013 Agriculture and Resource\u2011Related Industries).\n   * Several contacts in the San Francisco District reported difficulties finding enough labor (San Francisco \u2013 Agriculture and Resource\u2011Related Industries).\n\n6. **Role of government support**\n   * Contacts in the St. Louis Fed District reported that government support would be a \u201ccritical lifeline\u201d for many farmers (St. Louis \u2013 Agriculture and Natural Resources).\n\nIn sum, the agriculture sector was characterized by strong physical production in some regions (e.g., Dallas, Minneapolis) but pervasive financial pressure in many crop\u2011heavy areas due to sub\u2011profitable crop prices, rising input costs, deteriorating credit conditions, and region\u2011specific stresses. Livestock, especially cattle, generally fared better, with stronger prices and relatively stronger financial conditions (Kansas City, Chicago, Minneapolis).",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer highlights four specific District takeaways: (1) overall mixed conditions; (2) St. Louis strained and deteriorating; (3) Chicago crops in good shape, with lower soybean prices due to lack of new-crop exports to China; (4) Atlanta demand healthy; (5) Minneapolis concerned about China eliminating soybean purchases. The agent correctly states conditions were mixed and accurately captures St. Louis strained/deteriorated and Chicago generally in good shape, and it characterizes Atlanta as mostly healthy. However, it does not include the key expected China-related details: Chicago\u2019s lower soybean prices specifically due to absence of new-crop exports to China, and Minneapolis contacts\u2019 concern about China eliminating soybean purchases. It also adds many extra districts and claims not in the expected answer, but that\u2019s not the main issue; the missing China/soybean specifics make it only partially correct.",

      "question": "What supply chain disruptions affected manufacturing, and how did they impact production?",
      "expected": "Supply chain challenges varied across districts. In San Francisco, manufacturers noted higher costs for utilities and imported semiconductor chips. In Chicago, manufacturing demand declined modestly with fabricated metals demand unchanged on balance as higher sales to some sectors were offset by lower sales to construction and automotive industries. Tariff-induced input cost increases affected manufacturing across many districts, with firms reporting difficulty planning due to changing tariff policies. Labor shortages due to immigration policy changes also constrained production in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture sectors.",
      "got": "Supply chain disruptions that affected manufacturing, and their production impacts, as documented in the findings, are:\n\n1. **Tariffs and Higher Import Duties (Policy-Driven Disruptions)**\n   * **Disruption:**  \n     * Tariffs and higher import duties increased the cost of imported supplies, including raw materials, electrical and electronic components, food, and metals such as steel and aluminum. (Federal Reserve Banks of San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia, Boston, New York, Cleveland)\n   * **Impact on Production:**  \n     * Manufacturers reported tariffs as a headwind, weighing on manufacturing outlooks and demand. (Boston, Dallas, Cleveland)  \n     * Manufacturers attributed modest declines in demand for goods to tariffs and reported modest declines in manufacturing demand. (Cleveland, Chicago)  \n     * Tariffs contributed to sharper selling price increases in the manufacturing sector; manufacturers introduced price increases to cover elevated input costs. (Dallas, Cleveland)  \n     * Many businesses and vendors worked to find alternative inputs to mitigate tariff cost impacts, and some suppliers absorbed part of tariff\u2011related price increases. (New York, San Francisco)  \n     * Some firms shipped unfinished goods to the U.S. for final assembly specifically to manage tariffs (along with shipping and labor dynamics), altering production configurations. (St. Louis)\n\n2. **Rising Input Costs for Energy, Metals, and Semiconductor Chips**\n   * **Disruption:**  \n     * Nonlabor input costs rose robustly, with higher costs for utilities, energy, and raw materials including aluminum, copper, and steel, and higher costs for imported semiconductor chips used in manufacturing. (San Francisco, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City)\n   * **Impact on Production:**  \n     * Manufacturers faced challenges making production and pricing plans amid these higher input costs. (Boston)  \n     * Manufacturers raised their own selling prices to cover elevated input costs. (Cleveland)  \n     * Rising input costs contributed to inflationary pressures and weighed on manufacturing outlooks. (Dallas, San Francisco, Chicago)  \n     * A manufacturing firm described raw material cost pressures as high but moderating over time (\u201cfrom a boil to a simmer\u201d), affecting cost structures and expectations. (Kansas City)\n\n3. **Labor Shortages and Labor Dynamics**\n   * **Disruption:**  \n     * Manufacturing contacts reported labor shortages and broader worker availability issues, including workers not reporting to work due to fears of deportation and general difficulty finding enough labor. (St. Louis, Chicago, San Francisco)  \n     * An apparel company offshored manufacturing to the Caribbean due to labor challenges. (St. Louis)\n   * **Impact on Production:**  \n     * Some manufacturing firms added workers to meet demand, while others kept or reduced headcounts; on balance, manufacturing employment was unchanged, indicating constraints on expanding production capacity in some cases. (Boston)  \n     * Labor shortages and challenges contributed to offshoring decisions and reconfiguration of production (e.g., apparel manufacturing moved abroad). (St. Louis)  \n     * Construction-related labor shortages (though in construction, not manufacturing) led to project delays and upward pressure on construction costs, illustrating how labor constraints in related sectors can affect demand for manufactured inputs. (Boston, St. Louis, Philadelphia)\n\n4. **Logistics and Shipping Costs / Configuration Changes**\n   * **Disruption:**  \n     * Firms faced higher or problematic shipping and logistics costs; freight contacts reported higher warehouse utilization linked to pre\u2011tariff import surges, and firms were looking for cost\u2011effective shipping strategies. (Cleveland, St. Louis)  \n     * Although trucking capacity was elevated (indicating no immediate shortage of trucks), firms still responded to logistics cost pressures. (Atlanta, St. Louis)\n   * **Impact on Production:**  \n     * Manufacturers built multiple facilities across regions to offset shipping and logistics costs, altering where production occurs to manage supply chain risks and costs. (St. Louis)  \n     * Some manufacturers shipped unfinished goods to the U.S. for final assembly to manage tariffs, shipping, and labor dynamics, effectively splitting production stages geographically. (St. Louis)  \n     * Higher warehouse utilization and pre\u2011tariff import surges changed inventory and staging patterns for goods feeding into manufacturing. (Cleveland)\n\n5. **Semiconductor and Component Cost Pressures**\n   * **Disruption:**  \n     * Costs for imported semiconductor chips used in manufacturing rose. (San Francisco)  \n     * Imported components generally became more expensive, contributing to rising nonlabor input costs. (Cleveland, San Francisco)\n   * **Impact on Production:**  \n     * Increased semiconductor and component costs raised overall production costs in sectors reliant on these inputs; manufacturers responded with higher selling prices. (Cleveland, San Francisco)  \n     * While materials availability was reported as generally adequate in recent weeks, higher prices added to planning difficulties and weighed on outlooks. (San Francisco)\n\n6. **Demand-Side Effects Linked to These Disruptions**\n   * **Disruption Link:**  \n     * Tariffs, higher input costs, and policy uncertainty contributed to slowing demand for manufactured goods. (Dallas, Cleveland, Chicago, New York)\n   * **Impact on Production:**  \n     * Manufacturing demand declined modestly, with reports of modest declines in demand for goods attributed specifically to tariffs. (Chicago, Cleveland)  \n     * Auto production was down modestly; fabricated metals saw lower sales to the automotive sector, and machinery orders decreased, driven by weaker demand from the automotive industry. (Chicago)  \n     * Slowing demand weighed on manufacturing outlooks and led some manufacturers to postpone or then proceed with workforce cuts while waiting for industrial production to recover. (Dallas, Cleveland)  \n     * Manufacturing activity dipped, and perceptions of broader business conditions worsened. (Dallas, Chicago, New York)\n\n7. **Sector-Specific Production Impacts**\n   * **Automotive and Related Manufacturing:**  \n     * Auto production was down modestly in late August and September; fabricated metals had lower sales to automotive; heavy truck production was flat. (Chicago)  \n     * Suppliers to the auto industry showed weaknesses, which contributed to a modest decline in business loan quality. (Chicago)  \n     * Declines in machinery orders were driven by reduced demand from the automotive industry, linking auto\u2011sector supply/demand issues back into capital goods manufacturing. (Chicago)\n   * **General Manufacturing:**  \n     * Contacts across multiple Districts reported higher input costs (utilities, metals, semiconductors) and tariff pressures, leading to increased prices for finished manufactured goods and more cautious production planning. (San Francisco, Cleveland, Chicago, Dallas, Boston)\n\n8. **Strategic Production Adjustments in Response to Disruptions**\n   * **Reshoring and Regionalization:**  \n     * A few contacts reported some reshoring of steel production. (Chicago)  \n     * Firms built multiple facilities across regions, in part to manage shipping and logistics costs. (St. Louis)\n   * **Sourcing Changes:**  \n     * Many businesses sought alternative inputs from vendors to mitigate tariff impacts; some foreign producers cut prices or factored tariffs into pricing to retain market share. (New York, Cleveland, San Francisco)  \n     * These responses altered input sourcing patterns and, indirectly, production locations and cost structures.\n\nIf you want, I can next separate these disruptions into \u201ccost-driven,\u201d \u201cpolicy-driven,\u201d and \u201clogistics/labor-driven\u201d buckets to clarify their distinct production impacts.",

It also notes Chicago\u2019s modest decline in manufacturing demand and weaker automotive-related sales. However, it does not clearly include the expected detail that fabricated metals demand was unchanged on balance in Chicago (offsetting higher sales to some sectors against lower sales to construction and automotive). It also broadens into additional logistics/shipping and other district details not required by the question/expected answer, while only partially matching the specific Chicago fabricated-metals nuance and the explicit cross-sector (manufacturing, construction, agriculture) immigration-policy constraint framing.",

      "question": "Which retail categories saw gains versus declines, and how does this reflect consumer behavior patterns?",
      "expected": "In Chicago, leisure and hospitality sales were mixed. Categories seeing gains included restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments, as well as new light vehicle sales which were brisk due to strong underlying demand and the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases. Categories seeing softness included travel-related categories such as airlines and hotels. Used vehicle sales remained steady though dealerships in low-to-moderate income communities reported softer demand.

What these patterns reflect about consumer behavior\n\n**a. Inflation and reduced purchasing power \u2192 pullback in many goods**\n\n- Contacts reported that \u201cinflation is eroding consumer purchasing power.\u201d  \n  (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Summary of Economic Activity)\n- Consumer spending declined slightly or somewhat in several districts.  \n  (Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis; OverallEconomicActivity)\n- This erosion of purchasing power coincides with **softening in broad retail goods**, including food, beverages, clothing (in some areas), electronics, furniture, and building materials, as noted above.\n\n**b. Strong value orientation and cautious spending, especially for lower incomes**\n\n- Consumers were \u201cincreasingly focused on finding value in their purchases\u201d and \u201clooking for value, deals, and ways to stretch their dollars,\u201d including at shopping malls.  \n  (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Consumer Spending)\n- Some retail contacts offered discounts on select items instead of broad price increases.  \n  (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Prices)\n- Low\u2011 and moderate\u2011income households \u201ctook steps to reduce spending where possible,\u201d and respondents expected customers with lower personal incomes to face more challenges.  \n  (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Community Perspectives; Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Community and Regional Banking)\n- These behaviors align with:\n  - Pullbacks on add\u2011ons like **alcoholic beverages** at restaurants.  \n    (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, ConsumerSpending)\n  - Softening in many non\u2011luxury discretionary categories, and reports of skeleton staffing and margin pressure in grocery and other retail.  \n    (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, WorkerExperience; Minneapolis, Consumer Spending)\n\n**c. Divergence by income: resilience at the high end**\n\n- Mid\u2011 to upper\u2011income consumers are cited as resilient: a department store said stronger sales were \u201cin part\u201d due to resilience among mid\u2011 to upper\u2011income consumers.  \n  (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Prices)\n- Luxury segments are described as \u201ccontinu[ing] to perform well\u201d (luxury goods, luxury leisure travel, luxury services), and the luxury end of Manhattan retail remained \u201cparticularly resilient.\u201d  \n  (Federal Reserve Banks of San Francisco, Philadelphia, St. Louis, New York)\n- At the same time, a Missouri hotel owner saw a pronounced dip in travel among middle\u2011class consumers.  \n  (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Consumer Spending)\n- This pattern indicates that:\n  - **High\u2011income consumers** are still spending on luxury goods and upscale experiences.\n  - **Middle and lower\u2011income consumers** are more constrained, trading down and cutting extras.\n\n**d. Selective spending on experiences and affordable dining**\n\n- Despite weakness in many travel\u2011related categories, there is:\n  - Growth specifically in **luxury leisure travel**.  \n    (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Trade and Services)\n  - Continued corporate spending on **travel, events, and luxury services**.  \n    (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Consumer Spending)\n- At the mass\u2011market level, consumers increased spending in **fast food, fast casual, and family dining** while economizing within the occasion (e.g., skipping alcoholic beverages).  \n  (Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago and Atlanta, Consumer Spending)\n- This indicates a **reallocation within services**:\n  - Toward either lower\u2011ticket convenience dining or high\u2011end, luxury experiences.\n  - Away from mid\u2011range discretionary travel and hospitality, where softness is reported.\n\n**e. Category\u2011specific preferences and timing effects**\n\n- **EVs:** A \u201crobust surge\u201d in electric vehicle sales occurred ahead of the tax credit expiration, showing that policy\u2011driven timing strongly influences big\u2011ticket purchases.  \n  (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, ConsumerSpending; OverallEconomicActivity)\n- **Athletic footwear:** Continued strong performance in athletic footwear, even as broader clothing sales soften in some regions, shows consumers selectively maintaining or prioritizing certain product types within apparel.  \n  (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, RetailTradeandServices)\n\n### 4. Overall interpretation\n\nAcross the cited Federal Reserve sources, the pattern is:\n\n- **Many broad retail goods categories (food/beverage, non\u2011luxury apparel in some districts, electronics, furniture, building supplies, pet supplies) are softening or declining**, reflecting:\n  - Eroded purchasing power from inflation,\n  - A general pullback and caution in spending,\n  - Stronger focus on value and discounting, especially among low\u2011 and middle\u2011income households.\n\n- **Niche and higher\u2011income\u2011oriented segments (luxury goods, luxury travel and services, the luxury end of urban retail, EVs, athletic footwear, some apparel in New York) are holding up or growing**, reflecting:\n  - Resilient spending by mid\u2011 and upper\u2011income consumers,\n  - Willingness at the top end to continue purchasing premium goods and experiences.\n\n- **Service spending is bifurcated**:\n  - Growth in **affordable, mass\u2011market dining** formats but with economizing (fewer alcoholic drinks),\n  - Weakness in many **non\u2011luxury travel and hospitality** categories,\n  - Strength concentrated in **luxury leisure travel**.\n\nThese gains and declines, as documented, collectively depict consumers **trading down and pruning non\u2011essential or add\u2011on spending**, while **higher\u2011income segments continue to support luxury goods and experiences** and selectively favored categories like athletic footwear and EVs.",

(Philadelphia)\n  - Overall bank lending volume (excluding credit cards) **declined moderately**, driven by a **continued strong decline in commercial and industrial (C&I) lending** and a **modest decline in commercial real estate (CRE) loans**.

(Philadelphia)\n- **Implication for comparison**\n  - Within this District, **consumer lending was expanding** while **business-related lending (C&I and CRE) was contracting**.\n\n### New York\n- **Consumer vs. Business demand**\n  - Small-to-medium sized banks reported that **demand for consumer loans held steady**. (New York, Banking and Finance)\n  - The same banks reported that **demand for business loans sagged**, and **overall loan demand declined** because of this weakness in business loans. (New York, Banking and Finance; Summary of Economic Activity)\n- **Implication for comparison**\n  - In this District, **consumer loan demand was stable**, but **business loan demand weakened and pulled overall loan demand down**.\n\n### Chicago\n- **Consumer lending**\n  - In the consumer sector, **loan demand increased slightly**. (Chicago)\n  - Consumer **loan terms tightened slightly**, but **loan rates edged down** and **loan quality remained flat** in late August and September. (Chicago)\n- **Business lending**\n  - **Business loan demand decreased slightly on net** in late August and September; one contact linked this to a **decline in acquisition activity**. (Chicago)\n  - **Business loan terms tightened** despite **lower business loan rates**, and **business loan quality declined modestly**. (Chicago)\n- **Implication for comparison**\n  - In this District, **consumer loan demand was edging up with stable quality**, whereas **business loan demand was softening and loan quality was deteriorating modestly, with tighter terms for businesses than before**.\n\n### Dallas\n- **Overall loan/sector mix (consumer vs. business not split, but relevant conditions)**\n  - **Loan demand and loan volume rose modestly** in the Eleventh District. (Dallas, Summary of Economic Activity)\n- **Standards/terms**\n  - **Credit standards continued tightening** for \u201cremaining loan types,\u201d and **loan terms continued tightening** as well. (Dallas, Financial Services)\n  - **Credit standards eased slightly for residential real estate loans** (a consumer product) in September. (Dallas)\n- **Implication for comparison**\n  - The only explicit contrast is that **residential real estate (consumer) standards eased slightly**, while, more broadly, **other loan types (which would include many business loans) saw continued tightening**.\n\n### Kansas City\n- **Consumer lending**\n  - District banks reported **moderate deterioration in consumer lending** and expect consumer lending to **face challenges over the next six months** as **disposable income levels decrease**. (Kansas City, Community and Regional Banking)\n  - Banks noted **little to no change in loan demand across categories** and **little to no change in credit standards across categories** at the time of the report. (Kansas City, Community and Regional Banking)\n- **Business/CRE lending**\n  - For commercial real estate and construction, **credit standards and access to credit were reportedly stable**. (Kansas City, Real Estate and Construction)\n  - Businesses\u2019 reports on overall economic conditions were described as **more mixed**. (Kansas City, Summary of Economic Activity)\n- **Implication for comparison**\n  - In this District, **consumer lending conditions were deteriorating and expected to worsen**, while **business and CRE credit standards and access were stable**, even though overall business conditions were mixed.\n\n### Richmond\n- **Consumer lending / credit quality**\n  - Financial institutions reported **modest increases in loan delinquencies**, mainly within **consumer loan portfolios including mortgages and home equity loans**. (Richmond)\n  - Mortgages were specifically cited among consumer products where **delinquencies had modestly increased**. (Richmond)\n- **Business lending**\n  - Institutions reported that **demand for most loan types was stable**, with **some noting a modest increase in demand within their commercial loan portfolios**.

(St. Louis, Banking and Finance)\n  - A banker reported **limited access to credit for smaller borrowers** and **more scrutiny of small business loans**. (St. Louis, Banking and Finance)\n  - Overall **credit conditions remained strong**.
