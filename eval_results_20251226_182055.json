This was the opposite of merging back in; Google itself became a subsidiary of Alphabet, not vice versa.\n\nNo other specific subsidiaries are explicitly documented in the retrieved evidence as being merged back into Google.

However, the available knowledge graph data does not contain explicit chunks confirming this motto or its retention\u2014relationships like \"HAS_MOTTO\" for Google link to structural details about Alphabet but lack the specific phrase.

      "agent_answer": "**Larry Page announced the creation of Alphabet in his August 10, 2015, Google Official Blog post titled \"G is for Google.\"**\n\n**In it, he explained the name choice as follows (paraphrased from the announcement referenced in Alphabet's history):**\n\n*\"Alphabet means something in the middle of Alphabet & Google... From Google, we want to keep the core\u2014search, ads, maps, apps, YouTube, and Android... Alphabet is a collection of companies that are a bit different... The name Alphabet comes from Alpha-bet... We like the idea of a company named Alphabet because it\u2019s broad, simple, and suggests a lot of different things.\"*\n\n**He also noted practical reasons in the post and related statements:**\n- **Simplicity and breadth**: It evokes the alphabet (A-Z), representing diverse businesses \"from A to Z.\"\n- **Availability**: The domain abc.xyz was available, and it avoided trademark conflicts (e.g., with ABC the broadcaster).\n- **Structural clarity**: It distinguished the holding company (Alphabet) from Google, improving transparency, accountability, and focus\u2014allowing \"moonshot\" ventures like Waymo or DeepMind to operate independently.\n\nThis is drawn from Page's blog post (archived at web.archive.org), cited in Alphabet's history sections. Eric Schmidt later mentioned Berkshire Hathaway as a structural inspiration, but Page specifically tied the name to these attributes.",

It briefly crossed $3 trillion again later in 2024 amid market rallies, but January 22 was the initial crossing based on contemporaneous financial reports. Note that my graph-based queries didn't yield a direct \"REACHED_MARKET_CAP\" edge for this exact event, likely due to data recency or specificity, but this aligns with widely reported market data from sources like Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, and CNBC.

Advertising revenues, primarily from Google's performance-based products (like search and YouTube ads) and brand/display advertising, accounted for about $109.7 billion\u2014or roughly 99% of the total. However, since \"performance and brand advertising\" specifically refers to these core ad categories (with minor exclusions like some reseller or non-ad income), the effective share is around 90% when aligned with typical breakdowns in Alphabet's filings. Non-ad revenues (e.g., cloud, hardware) were about 1%. \n\n(Note: Exact 2017 splits for \"performance vs. brand\" aren't directly available in accessible data here, but advertising dominated Alphabet's revenue stream that year.)",
