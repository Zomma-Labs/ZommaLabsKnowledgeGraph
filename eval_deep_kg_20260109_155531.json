      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "answer": "According to the most recent Beige Book reporting for the Federal Reserve\u2019s Twelfth District (San Francisco), covering roughly mid\u2011August to September:\n\n- Overall economic activity in the Twelfth District **\u201cedged down slightly\u201d** during the period. [Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco \u2013 Summary of Economic Activity; National Summary \u2013 San Francisco]\n\n- **Outlook:** Contacts\u2019 **economic outlook weakened somewhat** compared with the prior reporting period. [FRB San Francisco \u2013 Summary of Economic Activity]\n\n- **Labor market:** **Employment levels were little changed on net**, with most employers holding headcounts steady. [National Summary \u2013 San Francisco; FRB San Francisco \u2013 Summary of Economic Activity]\n\n- **Prices:** **Prices rose modestly** over the period. [FRB San Francisco \u2013 Summary of Economic Activity; National Summary \u2013 San Francisco]\n\n- **Sectoral changes:**\n  - **Resource-related sectors (including agriculture):** Conditions **weakened slightly**, and **agricultural activity decreased somewhat**. [FRB San Francisco \u2013 Summary of Economic Activity; National Summary \u2013 San Francisco]\n  - **Consumer and business services:** Conditions were **mixed**; within this, some full\u2011service restaurants in the Pacific Northwest saw **lower sales**, leading to business closures, while **demand for business technology services grew more noticeably**. [FRB San Francisco \u2013 Summary of Economic Activity; FRB San Francisco \u2013 Retail Trade and Services]\n  - **Manufacturing:** **Manufacturing activity remained stable** in the District. [FRB San Francisco \u2013 Manufacturing; National Summary \u2013 San Francisco]\n  - **Residential real estate:** **Activity in residential real estate decreased somewhat**; in Northern California, **residential real estate prices eased** amid weaker conditions. [National Summary \u2013 San Francisco; FRB San Francisco \u2013 Real Estate and Construction]\n  - **Commercial real estate:** **Commercial real estate activity was unchanged on balance**, but **Southern California experienced elevated commercial property vacancies**, which put **downward pressure on commercial rents** and led to **declines in rents across commercial sectors**. [FRB San Francisco \u2013 Summary of Economic Activity; FRB San Francisco \u2013 Real Estate and Construction]\n  - **Community support organizations:** Conditions **weakened modestly** over the period. [FRB San Francisco \u2013 Summary of Economic Activity]\n\n- **Credit conditions:** In the District, **lending activity remained stable**, and **demand for commercial loans remained generally muted**. [National Summary \u2013 San Francisco; FRB San Francisco \u2013 Financial Institutions]\n\nIn sum, over the latest mid\u2011August to September period, the San Francisco Fed reports that economic activity in the Twelfth District **softened slightly overall**, with a weaker outlook, modest price increases, little net change in employment, softer residential real estate and resource\u2011related activity, mixed services, stable manufacturing, and flat but stressed commercial real estate marked by high vacancies in Southern California.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says overall activity in the Twelfth District (San Francisco) edged down slightly, and that retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or were stable. The agent correctly states that overall activity \u201cedged down slightly\u201d and that agriculture and residential real estate decreased. However, it does not clearly state that retail trade decreased or remained stable (it only mentions mixed consumer services/restaurants), so it misses one key sectoral element from the expected answer.",

      "question": "What is the Beige Book?",
      "expected": "The Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication about current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It characterizes regional economic conditions and prospects based on a variety of mostly qualitative information, gathered directly from each District's sources.",
      "answer": "The research you requested isn\u2019t available in the findings, so the only accurate response I can give\u2014while following your constraints\u2014is:\n\nThe findings do not specify what the Beige Book is, how it is defined, what its purpose or contents are, who compiles it, how often it is published, how it is used, or what format it takes.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer defines the Beige Book as a Federal Reserve System publication summarizing current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts, largely based on qualitative information from district sources. The agent\u2019s answer provides no definition and instead claims the information is unavailable, so it does not address the question.",

      "question": "How did overall economic activity change according to the October 2025 Beige Book?",
      "expected": "Economic activity changed little on balance since the previous report, with three Districts reporting slight to modest growth in activity, five reporting no change, and four noting a slight softening.",
      "answer": "According to the October 2025 Beige Book\u2019s national summary, overall economic activity showed a **mixed** pattern, with both softening and growth reported across Districts:\n\n- **Direction of change:**  \n  - *Four* Federal Reserve Districts reported a **slight softening in activity** since the previous report.  \n  - *Three* Districts reported **slight to modest growth in activity** over the same period.  \n  (National Summary > Overall Economic Activity)\n\n- **Outlook:**  \n  - The **outlook for future economic growth** was reported as **varying by District and sector**.  \n  - Many contacts expected **elevated economic uncertainty to weigh down activity**, although some, especially in manufacturing and in the Tenth District, were **optimistic about stronger sales and employment in 2026**.  \n  (National Summary > Overall Economic Activity; National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Kansas City; Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City > Manufacturing and Other Business Activity; Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City > Summary of Economic Activity)\n\nIn sum, the Beige Book described overall economic activity in October 2025 as neither uniformly expanding nor contracting, but rather **mixed**, with **slight softening in several Districts, slight\u2011to\u2011modest growth in others, and an outlook marked by both optimism for 2026 and concern about ongoing uncertainty.**",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says activity changed little on balance, with three Districts reporting slight to modest growth, five reporting no change, and four noting slight softening. The agent correctly mentions the three growth Districts and four softening Districts, but omits the key fact that five Districts reported no change and does not explicitly state \u201cchanged little on balance.\u201d It also adds extra outlook commentary not asked for.",

      "question": "Which districts reported slight to modest economic growth?",
      "expected": "Three districts reported slight to modest growth: Boston (First District), Philadelphia (Third District), and Richmond (Fifth District).",
      "answer": "The latest Beige Book national summary states that:\n\n- \u201cThree Districts reported slight to modest growth in activity since the previous report.\u201d [National Summary > Overall Economic Activity, 2026-01-09]\n\nHowever, the findings do **not** identify by name which specific Federal Reserve Districts those three are. The only district-level characterizations provided in the findings are:\n\n- Boston: \u201ceconomic activity expanded slightly\u201d in the Boston District. [National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Boston, 2026-01-09]  \n- Philadelphia: \u201cBusiness activity in the Philadelphia District increased slightly during the current Beige Book period.\u201d [National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Philadelphia, 2026-01-09]\n\nThese two districts clearly reported *slight* increases in activity. The Beige Book also notes a total of three districts with \u201cslight to modest\u201d growth, but the third district is not specified in the provided evidence.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer names three districts: Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond. The agent correctly identifies Boston and Philadelphia as reporting slight growth but fails to identify Richmond and instead claims the third district is unspecified. Therefore, the answer is incomplete relative to the expected list.",
