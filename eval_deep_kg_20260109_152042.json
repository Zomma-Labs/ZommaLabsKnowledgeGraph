      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "answer": "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\u2019s most recent Beige Book\u2013style \u201cSummary of Economic Activity\u201d for the Twelfth District (San Francisco), covering the mid\u2011August to September reporting period:\n\n- **Overall activity:**  \n  - \u201cEconomic activity in the Twelfth District edged down slightly during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period.\u201d  \n  - \u201cContacts' economic outlook in the Twelfth District weakened somewhat relative to the prior reporting period.\u201d\n\n- **Labor market and wages:**  \n  - \u201cEmployment levels in the Twelfth District were little changed on net during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period.\u201d  \n  - \u201cMost employers held head counts steady in the Twelfth District during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period.\u201d  \n  - \u201cWages in the Twelfth District grew slightly during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period.\u201d\n\n- **Prices:**  \n  - \u201cPrices in the Twelfth District rose modestly during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period.\u201d\n\n- **Sectoral changes:**\n  - **Retail / consumer spending:**  \n    - \u201cActivity in retail trade in the Twelfth District decreased somewhat during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period.\u201d\n  - **Consumer and business services / technology-related services:**  \n    - \u201cConditions in the consumer and business services sector in the Twelfth District were mixed during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period.\u201d  \n    - Within that, \u201cDemand for business technology services grew more noticeably within the consumer and business services sector.\u201d\n  - **Real estate:**  \n    - \u201cActivity in residential real estate in the Twelfth District decreased somewhat during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period.\u201d  \n    - \u201cCommercial real estate activity in the Twelfth District was unchanged on balance during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period.\u201d\n  - **Manufacturing:**  \n    - \u201cManufacturing activity in the Twelfth District remained largely stable during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period.\u201d\n  - **Resource-related sectors and agriculture:**  \n    - \u201cConditions in resource-related sectors in the Twelfth District weakened slightly during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period.\u201d  \n    - \u201cConditions in agriculture in the Twelfth District weakened slightly during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period.\u201d\n  - **Community support organizations:**  \n    - \u201cConditions in the community support organizations sector in the Twelfth District weakened modestly during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period.\u201d\n\n- **Credit / lending conditions:**  \n  - \u201cLending activity in the Twelfth District remained largely stable during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period.\u201d  \n  - Separately, for the district\u2019s financial institutions, \u201cDemand for commercial loans remained generally muted in the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco district during the reporting period,\u201d though \u201cRecent reductions in interest rates spurred additional demand for loans during the reporting period in the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco district.\u201d\n\nIn summary for the latest period examined, economic activity in the Twelfth District **declined slightly overall**, with **flat employment**, **slightly rising wages and modest price increases**, **notable softening in retail, residential real estate, agriculture, and other resource\u2011related sectors**, **stable manufacturing and commercial real estate**, and **more noticeable growth in business technology services**, alongside a **somewhat weaker economic outlook** among contacts.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says Twelfth District (San Francisco) economic activity edged down slightly, and that retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate decreased or were stable. The agent states overall activity edged down slightly and specifically notes retail activity decreased, residential real estate decreased, and agriculture weakened slightly. This matches the key facts, with extra detail that does not contradict the expected answer.",

      "question": "What is the Beige Book?",
      "expected": "The Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication about current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It characterizes regional economic conditions and prospects based on a variety of mostly qualitative information, gathered directly from each District's sources.",
      "answer": "The research findings do not provide any information about the Beige Book. They contain only a plan for what should be researched, and explicitly note that there are \u201cNo research findings available.\u201d\n\nBecause of this, the findings do not specify:\n- what the Beige Book is,\n- who publishes it,\n- how often it is published,\n- what it contains, or\n- what it is used for.\n\nSo, based strictly on the provided research findings, there is no basis to define or describe the Beige Book.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer defines the Beige Book as a Federal Reserve System publication summarizing current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts using mostly qualitative information from District sources. The agent\u2019s answer does not provide this definition and instead claims there is no basis to describe it. That fails to address the question and omits all key facts.",

      "expected": "Economic activity changed little on balance since the previous report, with three Districts reporting slight to modest growth in activity, five reporting no change, and four noting a slight softening.",
      "answer": "According to the October 2025 Beige Book\u2019s national summary, overall economic activity showed a **mixed but slightly softening pattern** compared with the previous report:\n\n- **Four Districts** reported a **slight softening in activity** since the prior Beige Book. [National Summary > Overall Economic Activity, 2026\u201101\u201109]  \n- **Three Districts** reported **slight to modest growth in activity** over the same period. [National Summary > Overall Economic Activity, 2026\u201101\u201109]\n\nDistrict-level descriptions were consistent with this mixed picture:\n\n- **Slight declines/softening:** New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported that economic activity **declined slightly, contracted slightly, or edged down slightly.** [Federal Reserve Bank of New York > Summary of Economic Activity; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis > Summary of Economic Activity; Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City > Summary of Economic Activity; Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity, all 2026\u201101\u201109]  \n- **Slight growth:** Boston and Philadelphia reported **slight expansions or increases** in activity. [Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Summary of Economic Activity; National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Philadelphia, 2026\u201101\u201109]  \n- **Little changed/flat:** Dallas, Chicago, Cleveland, Atlanta, and St. Louis reported **little changed or flat** overall activity.

      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says activity \u201cchanged little on balance,\u201d with 3 Districts slight/modest growth, 5 no change, and 4 slight softening. The agent correctly reports the 3 growth and 4 softening counts, and lists 5 Districts as little changed/flat. However, it characterizes the overall change as \u201cmixed but slightly softening\u201d and \u201cgenerally stable to slightly weaker,\u201d which diverges from the Beige Book\u2019s framing \u201cchanged little on balance.\u201d It also includes questionable citations/dates (2026\u201101\u201109) not asked for. Thus it has most key facts but not the overall characterization.",

      "question": "Which districts reported slight to modest economic growth?",
      "expected": "Three districts reported slight to modest growth: Boston (First District), Philadelphia (Third District), and Richmond (Fifth District).",
      "answer": "Based on the latest Federal Reserve Beige Book:\n\n- The **Boston (First District)** is described in the National Summary as having economic activity that **\u201cexpanded slightly\u201d** during the period referenced, with consumer spending in the district reported to have **\u201cgrew modestly\u201d** (National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Boston).\n\n- The **Philadelphia (Third District)** is reported to have **\u201cbusiness activity\u2026 increased slightly\u201d** and **nonmanufacturing activity\u2026 \u201cincreased slightly\u201d** during the current Beige Book period (National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Philadelphia; Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia > Summary of Economic Activity, which notes overall activity \u201cincreased slightly after rising modestly in the prior period\u201d).\n\n- The **Richmond (Fifth District)** is reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond as having the Fifth District economy that **\u201ccontinued to grow modestly in the current cycle\u201d** (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond > Summary of Economic Activity).\n\nThese three districts\u2014**Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond**\u2014are explicitly described as experiencing **slight to modest economic growth** in the latest Beige Book.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer lists Boston (First), Philadelphia (Third), and Richmond (Fifth) as the three districts reporting slight to modest growth. The agent\u2019s answer identifies exactly these three districts and explicitly states they experienced slight to modest economic growth, matching the expected answer.",
