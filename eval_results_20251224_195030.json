(the parent company of Google) is connected via \"REGULATED\" to the United States (among other locations like Japan and France), consistent with its status as an American multinational technology conglomerate holding company. Evidence from related documents notes regulatory actions by U.S. authorities, such as antitrust cases from the United States District Court, and its incorporation/foundational context in the U.S. (e.g., founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin remain controlling shareholders there). Specific filings like the Alphabet Inc. 2021 Annual Form 10-K Report would confirm the exact address (typically Mountain View, CA, or similar), but the graph emphasizes its primary U.S. base.",
