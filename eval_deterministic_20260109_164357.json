        "answer": "Based on the provided evidence, consumer spending is weakening and becoming more cautious:\n\n1. **Overall direction: slight decline**\n   - The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis reports that *\u201cconsumer spending was slightly lower\u201d*, with retail, hospitality, and tourism firms seeing **lower foot traffic, revenue, and profits relative to a year ago**, and expecting these weaker trends to continue, with **increasing pressure on margins** (Evidence 2, 8).\n   - The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis similarly notes that **\u201cconsumer spending has slightly declined\u201d** and that businesses are **anxious about the upcoming holiday season** (Evidence 5).\n\n2. **Shift in consumer behavior and financial strain**\n   - In the St. Louis District, **middle-income consumers are increasingly cautious** and have been **using credit to maintain their spending levels**, along with a **growing reliance on \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d** and rising food pantry usage among low- and middle-income households (Evidence 5, 9). This points to mounting financial stress and less discretionary spending capacity.\n   - By contrast, **upper-income households and corporate clients continue to spend on travel, events, and luxury services** (Evidence 5), indicating weakness is more concentrated in the middle and lower income segments.\n\n3. **Business responses: discounting to support demand**\n   - In the Philadelphia District, **consumer-facing businesses across sectors report they cannot fully pass higher costs to customers**, and **many are increasing discounts to sustain demand** (Evidence 3, 6). This includes:\n     - **More aggressive discounts from retailers**\n     - **Lower hotel room rates**\n     - **Increased incentives on autos and newly constructed homes**  \n   These steps suggest demand is soft enough that firms must sacrifice margin to keep volumes up.\n\n4. **Related signals from sectors**\n   - In the San Francisco District, **activity in retail trade decreased somewhat** (Evidence 4), consistent with softer consumer spending.\n   - Retailers in the Cleveland District have **held staffing levels steady** (Evidence 1), which aligns with a flat-to-soft environment rather than robust growth.\n\nOverall, the trend indicated by the evidence is that **consumer spending is slightly down, particularly in retail, hospitality, and tourism, with growing caution among middle-income consumers and increased discounting by firms to support demand, while higher-income spending on travel and luxury services remains relatively resilient.**",
