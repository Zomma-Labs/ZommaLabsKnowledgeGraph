    "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
    "expected": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
    "actual": "From the prior reporting period into **mid\u2011August\u2013September** (the latest Beige Book window), the Twelfth District (San Francisco) moved from roughly stable conditions to a **slight overall softening** in economic activity. Chronologically, the change can be summarized as follows:\n\n**Before mid\u2011August (previous reporting period)**  \n- Economic activity was roughly stable on balance (implied by the Beige Book\u2019s language that activity \u201cedged down\u201d and the outlook \u201cweakened\u201d *relative to the prior period*).  \n- Contacts\u2019 outlook was somewhat more positive than in the latest report.\n\n**Mid\u2011August to September reporting period (latest Beige Book)**  \nOver this specific window, conditions **edged down slightly**, representing a mild weakening rather than a sharp downturn.\n\n1. **Overall economic activity and outlook**  \n- **Overall activity:** Described as having **\u201cedged down slightly\u201d** in the Twelfth District over the **mid\u2011August to September** period, compared with the preceding report. [BeigeBook_20251015]  \n- **Outlook:** Contacts\u2019 **outlook weakened somewhat** relative to the prior period, indicating growing caution about near\u2011term conditions.\n\n2. **Labor markets (over the period)**  \n- **Employment:** Over mid\u2011August\u2013September, employment was **\u201clittle changed on net\u201d** as **most employers held head counts steady**. There is no indication of a major shift up or down in jobs during this window.  \n- **Wages:** **Wage growth continued but only \u201cslightly\u201d**, suggesting that earlier, stronger wage pressures had eased by this period.\n\n3. **Prices (over the period)**  \n- **Prices:** **Rose modestly** over mid\u2011August\u2013September. This implies that, compared with earlier periods of higher inflation, price pressures were present but more subdued.\n\n4. **Sectoral evolution mid\u2011August\u2013September**  \nWithin this reporting window, changes in economic activity were uneven across sectors:\n\n- **Retail trade:**  \n  - **Activity decreased somewhat** in this period, pointing to softer consumer spending than in the previous report.\n\n- **Residential real estate:**  \n  - **Activity decreased somewhat**, indicating a cooling from earlier, stronger housing activity.\n\n- **Agriculture and resource\u2011related sectors (including commodities):**  \n  - **Weakened slightly** during mid\u2011August\u2013September.  \n  - This contrasts with earlier conditions that were at least firmer, since the Beige Book characterizes this as a weakening relative to the prior period. [BeigeBook_20251015]\n\n- **Community support organizations:**  \n  - **Weakened modestly** in this window, consistent with broader softness in demand and funding conditions.\n\n- **Manufacturing:**  \n  - Reported as **largely stable** over mid\u2011August\u2013September, with no major shift in activity compared with the previous period.\n\n- **Commercial real estate:**  \n  - **Unchanged on balance** in this latest period.  \n  - New commercial construction was **subdued**, though some support came from infrastructure\u2011related projects; however, the most recent evidence does **not** specifically document data center or large\u2011scale infrastructure details, so those cannot be precisely timed or characterized beyond noting subdued new construction overall.\n\n- **Consumer and business services:**  \n  - Conditions were **mixed** in mid\u2011August\u2013September, implying that, relative to earlier reports, some service segments softened while others held up.\n\n- **Lumber and related markets:**  \n  - **Lumber prices fell** amid waning demand in some markets over this period, signaling sector\u2011specific softening in construction\u2011linked demand.\n\n**Net temporal pattern**  \n- **Prior period \u2192 mid\u2011August\u2013September:** The district transitioned from roughly stable conditions to **slightly weaker overall economic activity**, with:  \n  - Employment flat and wage growth slowing to a **slight** pace.  \n  - Prices still rising but **modestly**.  \n  - Noticeable **softening in retail trade, residential real estate, agriculture, and other resource\u2011related activities**, and community support organizations.  \n  - **Stable** manufacturing and **unchanged** commercial real estate on balance, and **mixed** outcomes in consumer and business services.\n\nThus, over time into the most recent mid\u2011August\u2013September period, the Twelfth District\u2019s economy did not contract sharply, but it **edged down from earlier stability into a mildly softer phase**, with weakness concentrated in consumer\u2011facing, housing, agricultural, and resource\u2011related sectors while other areas held steady.",

    "actual": "According to the October 15, 2025 Beige Book, overall U.S. economic activity showed very little net change over the reporting period, with a slight softening over time in several regions and in the outlook.\n\nChronological structure (as described in the October 15, 2025 report):\n\n1. **Change since the prior Beige Book (most recent reporting period up to October 15, 2025)**\n   - At the national level, the Federal Reserve summarized that overall economic activity **\u201cchanged little on balance\u201d** compared with the previous report.\n   - Across the 12 Districts during this latest reporting window:\n     - **3 Districts** reported **slight to modest growth**.\n     - **5 Districts** reported **no change** in activity.\n     - **4 Districts** reported **slight softening** (slight declines or contractions).  \n     [Source: BeigeBook_20251015, 2026\u201101\u201109]\n\n2. **District-level developments over that same recent period**\n   Within this overall \u201clittle changed\u201d national picture, the October 2025 Beige Book describes how activity evolved in individual Districts over the latest reporting period:\n\n   - **Seventh District (Chicago)** \u2013 recent period:\n     - \u201cEconomic activity in the Seventh District was **little changed over the reporting period**,\u201d indicating essentially flat activity.\n     - Within that flat overall level, **consumer spending increased modestly**, and **construction and real estate activity increased slightly**, while other components evidently offset these gains.\n\n   - **New York District** \u2013 recent period:\n     - \u201cEconomic activity **continued to decline slightly**,\u201d showing a continuation of mild contraction from earlier periods.\n\n   - **Minneapolis District** \u2013 recent period:\n     - \u201cDistrict economic activity **contracted slightly**,\u201d indicating a mild pullback compared with the prior report.\n\n   - **Kansas City (Tenth District)** \u2013 recent period:\n     - \u201cEconomic activity in the Tenth District **fell slightly over the past month**,\u201d showing a small downtick.\n\n   - **San Francisco (Twelfth District)** \u2013 recent period:\n     - \u201cEconomic activity in the Twelfth District **edged down slightly**,\u201d again a mild weakening relative to the prior period.\n\n   Put together, by the time of the October 15, 2025 Beige Book, the most recent month or so had seen:\n   - Some **flat or nearly flat conditions** (e.g., Chicago, several other districts counted in the five with \u201cno change\u201d).\n   - **Slight declines or contractions** in a number of districts (New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco and others in the four that \u201csoftened\u201d).\n   - A smaller number of districts with **slight to modest growth**, sufficient to leave overall activity \u201clittle changed on balance.\u201d\n\n3. **Evolution of expectations looking ahead (late 2025 into 2026)**\n   While the Beige Book focuses on recent changes, it also reports how expectations had shifted by October 2025 for the coming months and for 2026, relative to earlier outlooks:\n\n   - **Chicago (Seventh District)** \u2013 outlook over the next year:\n     - \u201cContacts expected a **slight decrease in activity over the next year**,\u201d marking a softening in expectations compared with the essentially flat current conditions.\n\n   - **New York District** \u2013 near-term outlook:\n     - Businesses \u201c**did not expect activity to increase much in the months ahead**,\u201d signaling weak growth expectations following the recent slight declines.\n\n   - **Boston District** \u2013 2026 outlook:\n     - Contacts \u201cviewed the outlook for **2026 as slightly weaker on balance**,\u201d even though current manufacturing sales had \u201crose modestly,\u201d indicating that expectations had deteriorated somewhat compared with earlier views.\n\n   - **San Francisco (Twelfth District)** \u2013 relative to the prior reporting period:\n     - \u201cContacts\u2019 economic outlook **weakened somewhat relative to the prior reporting period**,\u201d showing that sentiment had become more cautious over time.\n\n   - **Kansas City (Tenth District)** \u2013 expectations for 2026:\n     - Despite the recent slight decline, \u201c**expectations for sales and employment in 2026 were broadly optimistic**,\u201d and manufacturing contacts \u201c**expected that economic conditions would be more favorable next year than they were throughout 2025**,\u201d implying an improving outlook compared with the current year.\n\n4. **Overall temporal pattern described in the October 2025 Beige Book**\n   - **From the prior report up to mid\u2011October 2025**: Overall U.S. economic activity moved from whatever level it had previously been at to a state where, on balance, it **\u201cchanged little\u201d**\u2014with a mix of:\n     - Flat activity in many districts,\n     - Slight softening in several districts, and\n     - Slight to modest growth in a few.\n   - **Across districts during this same window**: The pattern was one of **broad stability with mild downside drift**\u2014some districts reporting continued or new slight declines (New York, Minneapolis, Kansas City, San Francisco), others holding steady (Chicago and others), and a smaller group reporting modest growth.\n   - **Looking forward from late 2025 into 2026**: The Beige Book indicates that **expectations had generally softened** compared with earlier periods, with many contacts anticipating slightly weaker or only marginally improving conditions, although some regions (notably Kansas City) remained **optimistic for 2026** relative to 2025.\n\nIn sum, as of the October 15, 2025 Beige Book, overall economic activity over the most recent reporting period was essentially **flat nationally**, but the chronological narrative within the report shows that, over time, modest growth in some areas was increasingly offset by slight contractions and a gradually more cautious outlook across many districts.",
