It is often referenced in discussions about labor market conditions. The area is noted for having healthy labor demand, particularly in the sectors of manufacturing, construction, and mining. However, despite this strong demand in key industries, there has been an increase in uncertainty within the overall labor market in the region. This suggests that while certain sectors are performing well, broader economic factors may be contributing to a less predictable employment landscape in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.\",4\n836,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF MINNEAPOLIS,\"The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is a regional branch of the U.S. Federal Reserve System. It is responsible for monitoring, analyzing, and reporting on economic conditions within the Ninth District, which encompasses Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, northwestern Wisconsin, and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. As part of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis plays a key role in gathering economic data, conducting research, and providing insights that inform monetary policy decisions at the national level. The bank's activities support the stability and effective functioning of the financial system within its district and contribute to the broader objectives of the Federal Reserve System.\",12\n46,HEALTH CARE,\"The health care industry, commonly referred to as \"\"HEALTH CARE,\"\" encompasses a broad range of activities including the provision of medical services, the manufacturing of medical equipment, and the development of pharmaceuticals. In addition to delivering essential medical care, the industry also offers insurance services, which play a significant role in the overall health care ecosystem. \n\nRecently, the health care industry has experienced notable challenges, particularly with rising costs that have had a direct impact on businesses and contributed to increased input costs across the sector. These escalating expenses are influenced by several factors, including labor market conditions and ongoing wage negotiations, which affect the cost structure of health care providers. Furthermore, the demand for elective procedures also shapes the industry's financial landscape, as fluctuations in this area can influence overall revenue and operational planning.\n\nDuring the most recent reporting period, the health care industry exhibited signs of weakness, reflecting the combined pressures of higher costs, labor market dynamics, and variable demand for services. Despite these challenges, the industry remains a critical component of the economy, continuing to provide vital medical services, develop innovative pharmaceuticals, and produce essential medical equipment. \n\nIn summary, HEALTH CARE is a multifaceted industry that not only delivers medical services and insurance but also drives advancements in medical technology and pharmaceuticals. It is currently navigating a complex environment marked by rising costs, labor-related pressures, and shifting demand for elective procedures, all of which have contributed to recent signs of weakness within the sector.\",4\n922,UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS,\"A measure of the number of people filing for unemployment benefits, reported as remaining low across the District.\",1\n927,ELECTRICITY RATES,\"The cost of electricity, noted as having significant increases for the coming year.\",1\n928,EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS,\"The cost of health insurance for employees, reported as increasing for the coming year.\",1\n929,RETAIL FUEL PRICES,\"The price of fuel at retail outlets, reported as having decreased slightly since the last report.\",1\n944,MINORITY- AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES (MWBE),\"Businesses owned by minorities and women, with continued activity in the District.\",1\n921,HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM,\"Industry sector focused on services for travelers and tourists, experiencing hiring mostly for turnover replacement, wage increases, and lower consumer spending.\",6\n195,WAGE GROWTH,\"WAGE GROWTH refers to the rate at which wages increase over time. Across various districts, wage growth has generally been described as modest to moderate, with some regional variation. In the Fifth and Ninth Districts, wage growth has been reported as moderate, while in the Second and Third Districts, it has remained modest, with the Third District specifically noting that the rate is near its modest pre-pandemic level. In some districts, such as the Eleventh, wage growth has been modest and is expected to slow further. Additionally, in certain districts, wage growth has been relatively muted or subdued, particularly for staff. Overall, pressures on wage growth have been easing slightly, and the rate of increase is generally reported within the range of 1-3%. This indicates that while wages are still rising, the pace of growth is not accelerating and, in some areas, may be slowing further.\",6\n386,WAGE PRESSURES,\"WAGE PRESSURES refer to the upward movement in employee compensation driven by labor market dynamics. Recent reports indicate that wage pressures have generally been modest, with some increases attributed to competition among employers and routine annual adjustments. However, there are also indications that these upward pressures are beginning to ease, suggesting that while some sectors or regions may still experience wage growth due to specific factors, the overall trend points toward a moderation in wage increases. This reflects a labor market where wage growth is present but not accelerating rapidly, and the intensity of wage pressures is diminishing compared to previous periods.\",3\n550,NONFINANCIAL SERVICES,\"NONFINANCIAL SERVICES refers to a broad sector that encompasses services not related to finance, including but not limited to professional, business, transportation, health care, information, retail, and leisure and hospitality services. This sector includes service providers such as those in retail, health care, and business services. \n\nDuring the most recent reporting period, the nonfinancial services sector experienced slightly contracting activity in the Eleventh District, which includes areas such as Texas and parts of surrounding states. Despite this slight contraction, service providers in the sector reported stable demand overall, though there remains uncertainty regarding future growth prospects. In the St. Louis Fed district, which covers parts of the Midwest, activity in the nonfinancial services sector was generally unchanged, indicating a stable environment without significant expansion or contraction.\n\nOverall, NONFINANCIAL SERVICES is characterized by a wide range of industries outside the financial sector, and recent data suggests a period of stability with some regions experiencing slight contraction and others remaining steady. The sector continues to face uncertainty about future growth, reflecting broader economic conditions and potential challenges ahead.\",7\n396,PROFESSIONAL AND BUSINESS SERVICES,\"The PROFESSIONAL AND BUSINESS SERVICES industry encompasses firms that offer a wide range of specialized services, including consulting, legal, accounting, software, and other business support functions. This sector has recently experienced a pickup in activity, reflecting moderate demand growth that is partly attributed to changes in rules and tax laws. Companies within this industry are known for facing significant wage competition and cost pressures as they strive to attract and retain skilled professionals. Overall, the PROFESSIONAL AND BUSINESS SERVICES industry plays a vital role in supporting businesses through expert services, adapting to regulatory changes, and navigating evolving market demands.\",2\n913,MINING,\"MINING is an industry sector focused on the extraction of minerals. In Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the mining industry is notable for its healthy labor demand, indicating a strong need for workers in this field. The sector plays a significant role in the region's economy, contributing to employment opportunities and supporting local communities through its operations.\",2\n421,LABOR DEMAND,\"LABOR DEMAND refers to the need for workers across various industries and the overall economy. It is a key indicator of economic health, reflecting how many workers employers are seeking to hire. Recently, labor demand has shown mixed trends. In several sectors, labor demand has been reported as healthy, indicating ongoing hiring and a continued need for workers. However, there are also signs of uncertainty and potential dampening in the future, suggesting that employers may become more cautious about hiring as economic conditions evolve.\n\nIn some industries, labor demand has declined, primarily due to reduced business activity. This decrease reflects a response to changing market conditions, where businesses may be scaling back operations or delaying expansion plans. Overall, while there have been slight upticks in labor demand in certain areas, the general trend has been a waning or low level of demand for workers. This suggests that, despite pockets of strength, the broader labor market is experiencing challenges, with employers showing less urgency to hire than in previous periods.\n\nIn summary, LABOR DEMAND is currently characterized by a combination of healthy activity in some sectors and a general trend of waning or low demand in others, influenced by economic uncertainty and reduced business activity in specific industries.\",6\n1045,HEAD COUNTS,\"HEAD COUNTS refer to the total number of employees at a business. Recently, there have been reductions in head counts, with the overall number of employees reported as being lower on balance. Most employers have maintained steady head counts by hiring only to replace departing workers, rather than expanding their workforce. This approach has resulted in a stabilization of employee numbers, despite the recent trend of reductions. Overall, HEAD COUNTS reflect the current employment levels within businesses, shaped by both recent decreases and a general tendency among employers to maintain rather than grow their staff.\",2\n1182,INFORMATION,\"Industry related to information services, which exhibited weakness.\",1\n202,LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY,\"LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY is an industry that encompasses businesses providing recreation, entertainment, and accommodation services. This sector includes establishments such as hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues. Recently, the leisure and hospitality industry has exhibited signs of weakness. In the Second District, firms within this sector have reported particular challenges, including difficulty in finding workers and experiencing strong wage growth. These labor market pressures have contributed to the overall softness observed in the industry, as businesses struggle to meet staffing needs while managing rising labor costs.\",1\n919,FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES,\"Employees working full-time, with only a small share of hospitality and tourism firms hiring new ones.\",1\n969,BOOKINGS,\"Reservations for hospitality and tourism, reported as unexpectedly lower in the fall.\",1\n971,HOTEL OCCUPANCY,\"The percentage of hotel rooms occupied, reported as lower across most of the District.\",1\n972,AVERAGE REVENUE PER ROOM,\"A hotel industry metric, reported as lower across most of the District.\",1\n949,MEDIAN WAGES,\"The middle value of wages paid to workers, reported as rising but more slowly than earlier in the year.\",1\n945,TEMP AND TEMP-TO-HIRE WORK,\"Employment arrangements where workers are hired on a temporary or trial basis before potentially being offered permanent positions, increasingly used in response to market uncertainty.\",1\n812,EMPLOYERS,\"EMPLOYERS are businesses or organizations that hire workers. In the Twelfth District, most employers have maintained steady head counts, indicating stability in their workforce numbers. However, employers have also been reported as adjusting their head counts and hiring practices in response to changing conditions. Recently, they have become more selective and less eager to fill open positions, reflecting a cautious approach to hiring. Overall, EMPLOYERS are organizations responsible for hiring workers, currently demonstrating a trend toward maintaining stable employment levels while exercising increased selectivity in their recruitment processes.\",2\n324,FIRMS,,4\n106,COST GROWTH,\"Cost growth refers to the rate at which business expenses are increasing, including labor, materials, and other inputs.\",2\n322,BUSINESS EXPENSES,\"Costs incurred by firms, including those from tariffs, which have increased.\",1\n331,HEALTH-CARE COSTS,\"Health-care costs refer to the expenses businesses incur to provide health insurance and medical benefits to employees, which have reportedly risen.\",1\n865,MINORITY- AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES,\"MINORITY- AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES (MWBE) are businesses owned by minorities and women, and are often monitored for their role in economic inclusion and overall business performance.
