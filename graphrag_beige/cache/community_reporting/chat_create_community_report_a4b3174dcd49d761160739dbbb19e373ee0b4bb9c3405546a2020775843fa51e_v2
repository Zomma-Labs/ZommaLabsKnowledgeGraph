The data indicates that prices have risen modestly to moderately in several regions, including the Ninth, Twelfth, Third, and Sixth Districts, during the most recent reporting period. These increases are attributed to factors such as tariffs and higher supply costs, which have contributed to ongoing but controlled inflationary trends.

The escalation in input prices is a key factor driving the overall rise in PRICES, as businesses facing higher production costs often pass these expenses on to consumers. This relationship is explicitly documented, with input price pressures identified as a major driver of price increases for goods and services.
