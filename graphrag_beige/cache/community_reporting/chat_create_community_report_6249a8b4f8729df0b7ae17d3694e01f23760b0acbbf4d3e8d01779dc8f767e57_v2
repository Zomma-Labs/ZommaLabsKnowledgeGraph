This sluggishness has led to a slow market environment, with some areas experiencing declining home prices. The ongoing weakness in the HOUSING MARKET has also had negative ripple effects on related sectors, particularly the manufacturing and construction/furniture industries, which are impacted by reduced demand stemming from the slow pace of home sales.
