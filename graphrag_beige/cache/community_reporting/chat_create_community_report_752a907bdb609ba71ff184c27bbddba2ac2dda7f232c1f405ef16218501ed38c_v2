Across various regions, including the Twelfth District, wages have experienced growth, though the pace has generally been slight to moderate. While the overall trend indicates modest increases, the rate of wage growth has varied across different sectors, with some experiencing more pressure than others. In summary, WAGES have risen slightly, reflecting modest to moderate growth across districts, with sector-specific variations in the degree of upward pressure.\",7\n40,LABOR COST PRESSURES,\"Labor cost pressures refer to the rising costs employers face in compensating workers, intensified by increased health insurance expenses.\",3\n80,LABOR SHORTAGES,\"Labor shortages occur when the demand for workers exceeds the available supply, resulting in a lack of sufficient labor to meet the needs of employers. This phenomenon is particularly evident in sectors such as manufacturing, construction, and agriculture, where the need for skilled and unskilled workers is often high. When labor shortages arise, they frequently lead to increased wages as employers compete to attract the limited pool of available workers. These wage increases can, in turn, contribute to broader cost pressures across affected industries.\n\nIn the context of specific regions, such as Boston, labor shortages have had a notable impact on the construction sector. The lack of available workers in this area has contributed to higher construction costs and has limited the amount of construction activity that can take place. Overall, labor shortages can have significant economic consequences, including increased operational costs for businesses, delays in project completion, and constraints on industry growth.\",2\n41,EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE EXPENSES,\"EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE EXPENSES are the costs incurred by employers to provide health insurance coverage to their employees.
