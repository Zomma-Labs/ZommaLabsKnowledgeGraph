The hospitality sector has traditionally relied on immigrant workers to fill a wide range of positions, from entry-level service roles to specialized functions. As immigration policies have tightened or shifted, the availability of this labor pool has diminished, exacerbating existing workforce shortages and making it more difficult for businesses to maintain adequate staffing levels. This has forced many hospitality businesses to focus their hiring efforts on replacing employees lost to turnover rather than expanding their workforce, further constraining growth and operational flexibility.

Recent changes in IMMIGRATION POLICY have had significant material impacts on labor supply, particularly in specific geographies and industries.

As a result, much of the hiring activity in the hospitality sector is focused on replacing employees lost to turnover rather than expanding the workforce.\n\nIn addition to labor issues, the hospitality industry is facing declining demand for its services.
