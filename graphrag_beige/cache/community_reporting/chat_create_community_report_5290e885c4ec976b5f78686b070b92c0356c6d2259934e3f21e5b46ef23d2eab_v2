The key entities are 'Upfitting Costs,' representing the significant expenses required to renovate or prepare properties for new tenants, and the phrase 'Math Doesn't Work,' which encapsulates the resulting financial infeasibility of such investments.

These costs can include construction, design, compliance, and other expenses necessary to make a property suitable for occupancy. The high degree of these costs directly impacts the feasibility of new investments, as they can deter both property owners and potential tenants from pursuing projects. This barrier is significant in shaping the commercial real estate landscape in the region [Data: Entities (576)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"The phrase 'Math Doesn't Work' encapsulates financial infeasibility.\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The community uses the phrase 'Math Doesn't Work' to succinctly describe situations where the financial calculations for a real estate investment do not yield a viable outcome due to excessive upfitting costs.
