This trend is partly a response to global supply chain vulnerabilities, trade policy changes, and the desire to strengthen domestic manufacturing capabilities. The movement of steel production back to the U.S. can have far-reaching effects, including job creation, increased domestic investment, and shifts in global trade balances.

Tariffs can raise the cost of imported steel, making domestic production more attractive and potentially spurring investment in U.S.-based facilities.
