This industry plays a crucial role in the development of both public and private spaces, contributing to the growth and modernization of communities. The construction industry is significantly influenced by several key factors, including labor availability, demand for new buildings, housing market trends, and tariffs. Labor availability can impact the pace and cost of construction projects, while demand is often driven by broader economic conditions and population growth. Housing market trends directly affect the volume of residential construction, and tariffs can influence the cost of materials and overall project expenses. According to recent survey data, the construction industry has reported no recent change in input prices, suggesting a period of relative stability in material costs. Overall, the construction industry is a dynamic sector shaped by economic, regulatory, and market forces, with its performance closely tied to trends in housing, commercial development, and infrastructure investment.\",8\n338,NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION,\"NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION refers to the sector dedicated to the construction of commercial, industrial, and institutional properties. This includes the development of buildings such as offices, factories, warehouses, schools, and hospitals. The activity within the nonresidential construction sector is influenced by various factors, including the level of federal funding, which can introduce uncertainty and impact project timelines and investment decisions. Despite these challenges, recent trends indicate that activity in the sector has increased slightly, reflecting a modest uptick in the construction of commercial and institutional properties. Overall, NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION plays a vital role in supporting economic growth and infrastructure development, with its performance closely tied to broader economic conditions and government funding policies.\",4\n291,NONMANUFACTURING ACTIVITY,\"Economic activity in sectors other than manufacturing in the Third District, which increased slightly.\",3\n39,WAGES,\"WAGES refer to the compensation paid to employees for their labor. Across various regions, including the Twelfth District, wages have experienced growth, though the pace has generally been slight to moderate. While the overall trend indicates modest increases, the rate of wage growth has varied across different sectors, with some experiencing more pressure than others. In summary, WAGES have risen slightly, reflecting modest to moderate growth across districts, with sector-specific variations in the degree of upward pressure.\",7\n40,LABOR COST PRESSURES,\"Labor cost pressures refer to the rising costs employers face in compensating workers, intensified by increased health insurance expenses.\",3\n362,EMPLOYEE TURNOVER,\"Employee turnover is the rate at which employees leave and are replaced within firms, reported as extremely low and a drag on business.\",1\n361,HISTORICAL AVERAGE,\"The historical average is a benchmark value used to compare current economic indicators such as employment, prices, and activity.\",2\n292,AUTO DEALERS (PHILADELPHIA),\"Automobile dealerships in the Third District, reporting a slight decline in activity.\",1\n359,JOB SITE,\"A job site is a specific location where construction work is performed, referenced in the context of labor shortages and project delays.\",1\n364,FOREIGN-BORN WORKERS,\"Foreign-born workers are employees who are not native to the country, whose availability is affected by immigration policies and impacts construction.\",1\n248,UTILITIES,\"Utilities refer to essential services such as electricity, water, and gas, with increased difficulty in payment noted.\",1\n534,REPLACEMENT WINDOW COMPANY,\"A company specializing in replacement windows, reporting strong sales as homeowners renovate rather than sell.\",1\n747,CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY SALES,\"Sales to the construction industry, reported as lower for fabricated metals.\",1\n347,SALES/REVENUES INDEX,\"The sales/revenues index measures changes in sales or revenue for firms, as reported in the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's surveys.\",1\n38,IMMIGRATION POLICIES,\"IMMIGRATION POLICIES refer to the set of government rules, laws, and regulations that govern the entry, residence, and employment of foreign nationals, particularly in the United States. These policies determine how people can move across borders, under what conditions they may reside in a country, and the terms under which they may seek and obtain employment. Immigration policies play a significant role in shaping labor market conditions, as they directly affect the movement and employment of foreign-born workers. In recent years, changes to immigration policies have been cited as a contributing factor to labor shortages, particularly in certain sectors and regions. By influencing the availability of foreign workers, these policies can strain the labor supply and impact the overall functioning of various industries. Thus, immigration policies are a critical component of national governance, with far-reaching effects on the economy, workforce composition, and demographic trends.\",5\n373,FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,\"The federal government is the national government responsible for policies such as tariffs, immigration, and funding for construction projects.\",3\n80,LABOR SHORTAGES,\"Labor shortages occur when the demand for workers exceeds the available supply, resulting in a lack of sufficient labor to meet the needs of employers. This phenomenon is particularly evident in sectors such as manufacturing, construction, and agriculture, where the need for skilled and unskilled workers is often high. When labor shortages arise, they frequently lead to increased wages as employers compete to attract the limited pool of available workers. These wage increases can, in turn, contribute to broader cost pressures across affected industries.\n\nIn the context of specific regions, such as Boston, labor shortages have had a notable impact on the construction sector. The lack of available workers in this area has contributed to higher construction costs and has limited the amount of construction activity that can take place. Overall, labor shortages can have significant economic consequences, including increased operational costs for businesses, delays in project completion, and constraints on industry growth.\",2\n339,FEDERAL FUNDING,\"Federal funding refers to financial support provided by the government for various projects. This funding plays a crucial role in enabling the initiation and continuation of planned construction projects. However, uncertainty regarding the status or availability of federal funding can lead to delays or a slowdown in the progress of these construction projects, as stakeholders may hesitate to proceed without clear assurances of financial backing. Thus, the reliability and clarity of federal funding are essential for maintaining momentum in project development and execution.\",3\n36,HOSPITALITY,\"The hospitality industry, referred to as \"\"HOSPITALITY,\"\" encompasses a broad range of services including hotels, restaurants, lodging, tourism, and travel services. This sector is currently experiencing several significant challenges. Labor supply within the industry is reportedly strained, making it difficult for businesses to maintain adequate staffing levels. As a result, much of the hiring activity in the hospitality sector is focused on replacing employees lost to turnover rather than expanding the workforce.\n\nIn addition to labor issues, the hospitality industry is facing declining demand for its services. This decrease in consumer demand has been noted across various segments, including hotels and related services. The industry is also being affected by shifts in consumer preferences and behaviors, which further contribute to the uncertainty surrounding future demand.\n\nAnother factor impacting the hospitality sector is changes in immigration policy. These policy changes have influenced the availability of labor, as the industry has traditionally relied on immigrant workers to fill many positions. The combination of strained labor supply, declining demand, and the effects of immigration policy changes has created a challenging environment for businesses operating within the hospitality industry.\n\nOverall, HOSPITALITY is characterized by its provision of lodging, food, tourism, and travel-related services, but is currently navigating a period marked by workforce shortages, high employee turnover, shifting consumer demand, and regulatory changes affecting labor supply.\",4\n41,EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE EXPENSES,\"EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE EXPENSES are the costs incurred by employers to provide health insurance coverage to their employees. These expenses represent a significant component of overall labor costs, as employers bear the financial responsibility of offering health coverage as part of employee benefits packages. Recently, EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE EXPENSES have experienced outsized increases, which have further intensified pressures on labor costs for businesses. This trend highlights the growing financial burden on employers as they strive to maintain competitive benefits while managing rising healthcare costs.\",2\n293,PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT,\"PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT refers to the number of employees working part-time. During the reporting period, there was a decline in part-time employment specifically among nonmanufacturing sectors in the Third District.
