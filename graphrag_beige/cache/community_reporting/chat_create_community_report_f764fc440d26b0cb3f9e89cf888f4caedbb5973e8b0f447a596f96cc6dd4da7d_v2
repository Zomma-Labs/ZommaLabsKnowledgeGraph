These rates are an important indicator of the health and dynamics of the industrial real estate sector. Currently, industrial vacancy rates are reported as low, indicating that most industrial spaces are occupied. However, there is a trend of the available space sitting on the market for longer periods before being leased or sold. Additionally, the proportion of unoccupied industrial properties has been increasing slightly, suggesting a gradual rise in vacancy rates. This combination of low overall vacancy but increasing duration of availability and a slight upward trend in unoccupied properties highlights a subtle shift in the industrial real estate market, where demand remains strong but may be softening compared to previous periods.\",3\n743,INDUSTRIAL SPACE,\"INDUSTRIAL SPACE is a segment of the commercial real estate market that primarily encompasses properties used for manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution purposes.

However, despite these low vacancy rates, there has been an observable increase in subleasing activity, suggesting that some tenants are seeking to offload space they no longer need. Additionally, the available industrial spaces are tending to remain on the market for longer periods before being leased, which may reflect shifting market dynamics or evolving tenant requirements.\n\nIn the context of Utah, rents for industrial space have remained relatively stable, with little change observed over recent periods.
