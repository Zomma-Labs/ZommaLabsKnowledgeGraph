The entities are closely related, as credit standards set the eligibility for loans while credit terms define the conditions under which credit is extended. Notably, while banks have generally tightened lending policies, there has been a slight easing of both standards and terms for residential real estate loans, indicating a nuanced approach to risk and opportunity in this sector.
