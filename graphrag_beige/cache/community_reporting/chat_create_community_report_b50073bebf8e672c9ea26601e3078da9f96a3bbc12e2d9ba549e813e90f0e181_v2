This lack of buyer interest in starter homes is directly affecting the overall volume of home sales in the District. The relationship between home sales and starter homes highlights the importance of this segment in driving market activity; when demand for affordable, entry-level properties is weak, it can have a disproportionate impact on total sales figures.

This resilience suggests that higher-end buyers remain active and that demand for premium properties is less affected by the factors suppressing the broader market.
