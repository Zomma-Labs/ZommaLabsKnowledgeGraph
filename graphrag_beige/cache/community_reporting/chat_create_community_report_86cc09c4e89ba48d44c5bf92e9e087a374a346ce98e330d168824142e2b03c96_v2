Its activities directly inform national monetary policy and support the stability of the financial system in the region. The bank's jurisdiction includes a broad geographic area—Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, northwestern Wisconsin, and Michigan's Upper Peninsula—making its analyses highly influential for a diverse set of stakeholders. The bank's centrality is evidenced by its direct reporting on multiple key economic indicators and its explicit reference to the inclusion of Michigan's Upper Peninsula in its district [Data: Entities (836); Relationships (783, 872, 881, 882, 884, 887)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Unemployment Claims Remain Low Across the District\",\n            \"explanation\": \"A notable finding from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is that unemployment claims have remained low throughout the Ninth District.
