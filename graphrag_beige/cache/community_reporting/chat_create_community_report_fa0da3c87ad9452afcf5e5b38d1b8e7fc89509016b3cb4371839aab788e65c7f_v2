Their performance in the Fifth District has been mixed, varying by location and the type of travel clientele they serve. Recently, the hotel industry has experienced softening demand, particularly within the commercial real estate sector and among select-service hotels, which have been notably affected by reduced travel demand from middle-class consumers. In response to ongoing cost pressures, hotels have reported lowering room rates. Occupancy rates and pricing trends are closely tied to broader tourism patterns, with recent reports indicating softness in sales across the sector.

It is a key economic concept that reflects consumers' willingness and ability to purchase various products. While demand can vary across different sectors, recent observations indicate a mixed landscape. In several industries, such as furniture, construction, and staffing, demand has decreased, raising concerns about weakening market activity in these areas. However, demand has remained strong for specific goods, notably cattle, where consumer interest and purchasing power have not diminished. Overall, while DEMAND continues to drive economic activity, its strength currently varies by sector, with some industries experiencing a notable decline and others, like cattle, maintaining robust demand.\",4\n564,SALES,\"Sales represent the total revenue generated by businesses through the sale of goods or services. This encompasses the total value or volume of goods and services sold, as reported by various sectors such as retailers, restaurants, furniture stores, manufacturing, and gaming facilities. While sales are a key indicator of business performance and economic health, recent reports indicate that several industries—including manufacturing and gaming facilities—have experienced declines in sales volume. Similarly, sectors such as retail, restaurants, and furniture stores have also reported decreases in sales. Despite these declines in certain areas, there are expectations for overall sales growth in 2026, suggesting a potential rebound or positive outlook for the future. In summary, sales serve as a critical measure of business activity, reflecting both current challenges in specific industries and anticipated growth in the coming years.\",3\n527,FUEL SURCHARGES,\"Fuel surcharges are additional fees added to transportation costs to account for fluctuating fuel prices, impacting both business revenues and household budgets.\",4\n557,HOUSEHOLD BUDGET,\"\nThe total spending capacity of households, referenced as being affected by fuel surcharges.\",1\n150,REVENUES,\"REVENUES refer to the income generated by businesses and firms across various sectors. This includes income from hotels and transportation companies, where revenues are often discussed in relation to factors such as occupancy rates, fuel surcharges, and travel activity.

Overall, REVENUES encompass the total income earned by businesses from their operations, with recent trends indicating modest growth in certain industries.\",4\n566,OCCUPANCY RATES,\"The percentage of available hotel rooms that are occupied, discussed as increasing in some areas and decreasing in others.\",1\n243,AFFORDABILITY,\"AFFORDABILITY refers to the capacity of consumers or buyers to purchase goods, services, or properties based on their financial means. In the context of real estate, affordability specifically denotes the ability of individuals or families to buy homes or properties, which is often influenced by factors such as income levels, housing prices, and mortgage rates. Lower mortgage rates can improve affordability by reducing the overall cost of borrowing, thereby enabling more people to enter the housing market. In Maryland, affordability is highlighted as a significant issue, indicating that many potential buyers may face challenges in purchasing homes due to high property prices, limited income growth, or other economic factors. Overall, AFFORDABILITY is a crucial consideration in both general consumer markets and the housing sector, affecting the accessibility of essential goods, services, and homeownership opportunities.\",1\n773,MIDDLE-CLASS RECESSION,\"The term \"\"MIDDLE-CLASS RECESSION\"\" refers to a period of economic stress that disproportionately impacts middle-income consumers.
