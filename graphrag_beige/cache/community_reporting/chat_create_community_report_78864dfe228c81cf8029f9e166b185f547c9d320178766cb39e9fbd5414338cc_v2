This trend is expected to continue, with generative AI specifically mentioned as a reason for both current and anticipated reductions in workforce size. The impact of AI on labor markets is multifaceted, affecting not only the number of jobs but also the types of roles that are in demand, and contributing to a broader 'hiring chill' as firms adjust their staffing strategies in response to technological advancements [Data: Entities (33, 548); Relationships (46, 577, 545)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Employers are increasingly favoring temporary and part-time workers over full-time hires.\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Labor market data reveal a shift in employer preferences toward hiring temporary and part-time workers rather than committing to full-time employment. This strategy allows firms greater flexibility in managing labor costs and adapting to uncertain economic conditions.

This reduced turnover is a key factor in the observed stability of employment levels, as fewer departures mean less need for replacement hiring. In sectors such as hospitality and tourism, where turnover traditionally drives ongoing hiring, the current trend of greater employee retention is notable.

This uncertainty is leading to more cautious hiring practices, with fewer head count additions and a general 'hiring chill' reported in some regions. The interplay between consumer demand, labor supply, and employment levels is complex, as firms must balance the need for workforce flexibility with the risks of under- or over-staffing in a volatile market environment.

Across various Federal Reserve Districts, recent data on employment levels show a generally stable trend, with some regional variations. In the Sixth District, employment levels were reported as flat over the period, indicating no significant change in the number of people employed. Similarly, several sectors across unspecified regions also experienced unchanged employment levels, reflecting stability in labor market conditions. In recent weeks, employment levels were largely stable, with little to no net change observed in the Twelfth District. However, there were slight increases in employment in certain areas: the Third District saw a modest rise in the number of people employed, and the Cleveland District (Fourth District) also reported a slight increase in employment levels in recent weeks. Overall, EMPLOYMENT LEVELS across these districts have remained mostly stable, with only minor increases in some regions, suggesting a steady labor market with limited fluctuations during the reported period.\",12\n32,LABOR MARKETS,\"Labor markets refer to the supply and demand for labor or workers, with key metrics including employment levels, hiring, turnover, and wage growth.

In specific regions, such as the Sixth District, the supply and demand for labor have been described as generally flat, while in the Twelfth District, labor market conditions were reported as little changed.
