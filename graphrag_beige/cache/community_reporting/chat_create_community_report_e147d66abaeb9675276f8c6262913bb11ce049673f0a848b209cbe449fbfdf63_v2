In the context of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s surveys, full-time employment is measured by the number of employees working full-time. Recent data from these surveys indicate that the number of full-time jobs has increased for both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms in the Third District. However, despite this growth, full-time employment is currently less favored by employers compared to other forms of employment. This suggests a shift in employer preferences, even as the overall number of full-time positions continues to rise in the region.\",4\n79,EMPLOYMENT,\"EMPLOYMENT is a key economic indicator that measures the level of jobs and labor market activity within a given economy or region. It encompasses the number of people employed, both full-time and part-time, and tracks changes in employment levels over time. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, among other institutions, monitors employment trends to assess labor market conditions.\n\nEmployment data is often reported by district or region, reflecting local economic dynamics. For example, in the Eleventh District, the number of people employed experienced a decline, indicating a contraction in job opportunities. In contrast, the Second District saw employment levels hold steady during the reporting period, suggesting stability in the labor market. Similarly, the Fifth District reported that employment remained unchanged overall, while the Ninth District noted that employment was flat to slightly down, pointing to minimal change or a slight decrease in job numbers.\n\nSectoral variations are also common, with some industries experiencing growth while others may see declines or stagnation. In the Third District, employment and hiring activity increased slightly, highlighting modest job growth in that area.\n\nOverall, employment serves as a reflection of labor market conditions, indicating the state of paid work, job availability, and hiring activity across different regions. Recent reports suggest that, while some districts have seen slight increases or decreases, employment has generally remained flat or unchanged in several regions, with sector-specific differences influencing the overall picture.\",13\n118,JOB SEEKERS,Job seekers are individuals actively looking for employment opportunities.,1\n363,WORKFORCE,\"Workforce refers to the total number of people employed by a firm or within a sector, with some firms shrinking their workforce.\",1\n290,THIRD DISTRICT,\"The region overseen by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, covering parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.\",8\n291,NONMANUFACTURING ACTIVITY,\"Economic activity in sectors other than manufacturing in the Third District, which increased slightly.\",3\n292,AUTO DEALERS (PHILADELPHIA),\"Automobile dealerships in the Third District, reporting a slight decline in activity.\",1\n293,PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT,\"PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT refers to the number of employees working part-time.
