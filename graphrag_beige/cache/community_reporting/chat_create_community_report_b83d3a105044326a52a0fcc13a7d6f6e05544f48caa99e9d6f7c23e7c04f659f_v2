The relationships among these entities highlight the impact of external cost pressures like tariffs and utilities on input costs and pricing power, as well as the comparative performance of nonmanufacturers relative to manufacturers. The data underscores the interconnectedness of cost pressures, pricing, and sectoral performance in shaping economic conditions for nonmanufacturers in the region.\",\n    \"rating\": 7.5,\n    \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is high due to the central role these economic indicators and nonmanufacturing firms play in regional economic health, policy decisions, and business planning.\",\n    \"findings\": [\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Nonmanufacturers are a major economic sector tracked by the Philadelphia Fed.\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Nonmanufacturers encompass a broad range of industries outside of manufacturing, including services, retail, and tourism.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia surveys nonmanufacturers to gather data on their operations and economic conditions, reflecting their importance in economic analysis and policy formulation.

Tariffs and utilities are specifically cited as significant sources of cost pressure affecting this index, indicating that external policy decisions and essential service costs directly impact business expenses.

This persistent elevation suggests ongoing inflationary pressures, which can erode profit margins and influence pricing strategies for nonmanufacturers.

This dual impact can compress margins and complicate pricing strategies, especially for nonmanufacturers who may have less flexibility to pass on increased costs to customers.
