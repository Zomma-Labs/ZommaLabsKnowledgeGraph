As a primary measure of inflation, changes in PRICES signal inflationary pressures and are closely monitored for economic analysis. Across various regions, including the Ninth, Twelfth, Third, and Sixth Districts, PRICES have been reported as rising modestly to moderately during the most recent reporting period. The increases in PRICES are attributed to several factors, such as tariffs and higher supply costs, which have contributed to input price pressures and expectations of further price increases. Overall, PRICES have continued to rise at a modest or moderate pace, indicating ongoing but controlled inflationary trends in the cost of goods and services throughout the economy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1769101845, "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_1a2c4a5ede", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 157, "prompt_tokens": 401, "total_tokens": 558, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
