In the context of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s surveys, full-time employment is measured by the number of employees working full-time.

However, despite this growth, full-time employment is currently less favored by employers compared to other forms of employment. This suggests a shift in employer preferences, even as the overall number of full-time positions continues to rise in the region.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1769101844, "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_1a2c4a5ede", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 121, "prompt_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 335, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
