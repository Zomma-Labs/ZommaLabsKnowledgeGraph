It plays a crucial role in facilitating commerce and supporting various sectors, including durable goods manufacturing. In some regions, such as the Eleventh District, transportation has been cited as a bright spot within the durable goods manufacturing segment, benefiting from factors like strong cotton harvests that have increased the movement of goods. However, overall activity in the transportation industry has generally declined among reporting Districts. For example, the Sixth District experienced a modest decline in the movement of goods and people, while firms in the Second District reported significant declines in employment within the sector.
