Recent reports indicate that wage pressures have generally been modest, with some increases attributed to competition among employers and routine annual adjustments. However, there are also indications that these upward pressures are beginning to ease, suggesting that while some sectors or regions may still experience wage growth due to specific factors, the overall trend points toward a moderation in wage increases. This reflects a labor market where wage growth is present but not accelerating rapidly, and the intensity of wage pressures is diminishing compared to previous periods.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1769101867, "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_1a2c4a5ede", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 113, "prompt_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 291, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
