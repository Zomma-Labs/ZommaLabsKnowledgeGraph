Recent reports indicate that agriculture conditions have generally been strained and deteriorating, reflecting challenges faced by the industry in terms of production and economic returns. However, it is important to note that there are regional variations; for example, in the Sixth District, the state of the agricultural sector was reported as mostly healthy. This suggests that while the broader agricultural sector is experiencing difficulties, certain areas are maintaining more favorable conditions.
