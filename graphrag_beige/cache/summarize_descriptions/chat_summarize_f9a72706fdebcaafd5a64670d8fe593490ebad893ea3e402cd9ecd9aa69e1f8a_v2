Across various districts, wage growth has generally been described as modest to moderate, with some regional variation. In the Fifth and Ninth Districts, wage growth has been reported as moderate, while in the Second and Third Districts, it has remained modest, with the Third District specifically noting that the rate is near its modest pre-pandemic level. In some districts, such as the Eleventh, wage growth has been modest and is expected to slow further. Additionally, in certain districts, wage growth has been relatively muted or subdued, particularly for staff. Overall, pressures on wage growth have been easing slightly, and the rate of increase is generally reported within the range of 1-3%. This indicates that while wages are still rising, the pace of growth is not accelerating and, in some areas, may be slowing further.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1769101859, "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_1a2c4a5ede", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 180, "prompt_tokens": 342, "total_tokens": 522, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
