They are primarily set by central banks, which use them as a key tool to influence economic activity, investment, and consumption. Financial institutions also play a role in setting specific interest rates for their products, but these rates are heavily influenced by the policies and benchmark rates established by central banks.\n\nInterest rates have a significant impact on various aspects of the economy. They directly affect loan demand, as lower rates make borrowing more attractive for both consumers and businesses. This, in turn, can stimulate capital spending, investment, and overall economic growth. Conversely, higher interest rates tend to dampen borrowing and spending, which can slow economic activity.\n\nRecent trends in interest rates have shown a pattern of decline, with both actual reductions and anticipated future cuts being reported. These falling interest rates have begun to spur additional demand for loans, as borrowers seek to take advantage of more favorable borrowing conditions. Many customers are also locking in current rates ahead of further anticipated decreases, aiming to secure the best possible terms before rates potentially drop even lower.\n\nOverall, INTEREST RATES are a crucial economic lever, influencing not only the cost of borrowing but also broader consumer behavior, investment decisions, and the pace of economic activity. The current environment of declining and anticipated lower interest rates is contributing to increased loan demand and shaping financial decisions across the economy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1769101851, "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_1a2c4a5ede", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 282, "prompt_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 547, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
