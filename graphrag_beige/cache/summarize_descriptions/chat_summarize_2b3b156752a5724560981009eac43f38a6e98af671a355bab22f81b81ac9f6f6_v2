This sector is distinct from residential construction, as it focuses exclusively on structures intended for business, commerce, and industry rather than private housing. In recent times, commercial construction has experienced modest increases in both demand and capital spending, reflecting a steady but not dramatic growth in activity. Notably, in regions such as the Cleveland district, the industry has seen an uptick in demand, a trend attributed in part to lower interest rates that have made financing new projects more attractive.
