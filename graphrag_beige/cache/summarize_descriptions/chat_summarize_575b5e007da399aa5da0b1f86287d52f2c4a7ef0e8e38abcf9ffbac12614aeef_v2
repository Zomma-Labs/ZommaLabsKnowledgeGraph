Recently, inventories have shown varied trends across different sectors. The stock of goods held by manufacturers has continued to shrink, indicating a reduction in the amount of unsold goods in this segment. In contrast, inventories in the retail sector have remained steady, suggesting that retailers are maintaining consistent stock levels. In the housing sector, inventories have fallen slightly but still remain elevated compared to typical levels. Overall, while there is a general trend of shrinking inventories among manufacturers, retail inventories are stable, and housing inventories, though slightly reduced, are still higher than usual. This mixed pattern reflects sector-specific dynamics affecting the overall level of INVENTORIES across the economy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1769101864, "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_1a2c4a5ede", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 152, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 328, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
