These costs encompass a variety of charges, including transportation, insurance, customs duties, tariffs, and other related fees. Recently, IMPORT COSTS have risen, contributing to higher input costs for businesses and consumers. The increase in import costs can be attributed to several factors, with tariffs being a significant contributor, as well as other influences such as changes in global trade policies, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
