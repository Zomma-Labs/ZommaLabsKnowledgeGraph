This segment of real estate is essential for retail businesses, providing the physical locations where transactions with customers occur. The demand for RETAIL SPACE can vary significantly by region. For example, in Manhattan, the demand for retail space is described as bifurcated, indicating a split or uneven demand across different areas or types of retail properties within the borough. In contrast, in Utah, there has been a notable increase in rents for RETAIL SPACE, suggesting strong demand and possibly limited supply in that market.
