It is a key economic concept that reflects consumers' willingness and ability to purchase various products. While demand can vary across different sectors, recent observations indicate a mixed landscape. In several industries, such as furniture, construction, and staffing, demand has decreased, raising concerns about weakening market activity in these areas. However, demand has remained strong for specific goods, notably cattle, where consumer interest and purchasing power have not diminished. Overall, while DEMAND continues to drive economic activity, its strength currently varies by sector, with some industries experiencing a notable decline and others, like cattle, maintaining robust demand.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1769101887, "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_1a2c4a5ede", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 327, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
