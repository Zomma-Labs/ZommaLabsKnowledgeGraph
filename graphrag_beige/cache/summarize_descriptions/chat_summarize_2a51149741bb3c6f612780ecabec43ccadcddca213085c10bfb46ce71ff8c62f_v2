These standards can vary by region and loan type, reflecting local economic conditions and risk assessments. In the New York District, bank lending policies have tightened, indicating that banks have become more cautious and selective in their lending practices. In contrast, credit standards in the Kansas City District have remained largely unchanged, suggesting stability in the criteria used by banks for loan approvals in that region. Additionally, while credit standards have generally tightened for most types of loans, there has been an easing of criteria specifically for residential real estate loans, making it somewhat easier for individuals to qualify for these types of loans compared to others. Overall, CREDIT STANDARDS are dynamic and can shift in response to economic trends, with recent data showing regional differences and variations by loan category.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1769101863, "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_1a2c4a5ede", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 373, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
