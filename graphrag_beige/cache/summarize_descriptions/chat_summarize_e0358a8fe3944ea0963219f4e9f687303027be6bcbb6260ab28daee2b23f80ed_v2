In the St. Louis Fed district, which covers parts of the Midwest, activity in the nonfinancial services sector was generally unchanged, indicating a stable environment without significant expansion or contraction.\n\nOverall, NONFINANCIAL SERVICES is characterized by a wide range of industries outside the financial sector, and recent data suggests a period of stability with some regions experiencing slight contraction and others remaining steady.
