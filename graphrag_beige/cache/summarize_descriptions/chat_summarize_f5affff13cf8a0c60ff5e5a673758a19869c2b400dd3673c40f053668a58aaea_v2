In the context of real estate, affordability specifically denotes the ability of individuals or families to buy homes or properties, which is often influenced by factors such as income levels, housing prices, and mortgage rates. Lower mortgage rates can improve affordability by reducing the overall cost of borrowing, thereby enabling more people to enter the housing market. In Maryland, affordability is highlighted as a significant issue, indicating that many potential buyers may face challenges in purchasing homes due to high property prices, limited income growth, or other economic factors. Overall, AFFORDABILITY is a crucial consideration in both general consumer markets and the housing sector, affecting the accessibility of essential goods, services, and homeownership opportunities.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1769101862, "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_1a2c4a5ede", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 341, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
