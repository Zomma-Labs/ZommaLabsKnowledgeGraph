It is a key metric in workforce management and is particularly significant in industries such as hospitality and tourism, where it is often cited as a primary driver for ongoing hiring needs. In recent reports, turnover has been described as low, with some firms in the Sixth District and across various industries experiencing historic lows in employee departures. This trend of reduced turnover has continued, indicating a slowdown in the rate at which employees are leaving and being replaced. As a result, while turnover remains an important factor influencing hiring, especially in sectors like hospitality and tourism, the overall rate has decreased, reflecting greater employee retention in many organizations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1769101889, "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_1a2c4a5ede", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 384, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
