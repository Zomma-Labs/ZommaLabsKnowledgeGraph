These companies are responsible for manufacturing a wide range of products and regularly report on key industry factors such as demand, input costs, and production capacity. Recently, manufacturers have experienced declining demand for labor, indicating a slowdown in hiring or a reduced need for workers. At the same time, they are facing higher input costs, which suggests that the expenses associated with raw materials, components, or other production inputs have increased.
