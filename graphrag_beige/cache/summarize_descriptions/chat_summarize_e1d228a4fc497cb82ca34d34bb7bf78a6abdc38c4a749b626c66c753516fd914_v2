It has been affected by higher import duties, which can impact costs and supply chains. At the same time, there has been an increased demand for assistance related to food, indicating that more individuals or communities are seeking support to meet their food needs. Despite these challenges, retail demand for food has softened, suggesting that consumers may be purchasing less or shifting their buying habits.\n\nAdditionally, FOOD is recognized as a segment of nondurable goods manufacturing. In this context, the sector has seen strong gains, particularly within the Eleventh District, highlighting regional growth and resilience in food manufacturing despite broader market pressures.
