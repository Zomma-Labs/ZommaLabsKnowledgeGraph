Their performance in the Fifth District has been mixed, varying by location and the type of travel clientele they serve. Recently, the hotel industry has experienced softening demand, particularly within the commercial real estate sector and among select-service hotels, which have been notably affected by reduced travel demand from middle-class consumers. In response to ongoing cost pressures, hotels have reported lowering room rates. Occupancy rates and pricing trends are closely tied to broader tourism patterns, with recent reports indicating softness in sales across the sector.
