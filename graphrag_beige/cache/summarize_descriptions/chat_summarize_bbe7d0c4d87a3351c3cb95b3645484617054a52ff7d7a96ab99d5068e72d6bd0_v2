This sector is characterized by low overall vacancy rates, indicating strong demand and limited available inventory. However, despite these low vacancy rates, there has been an observable increase in subleasing activity, suggesting that some tenants are seeking to offload space they no longer need. Additionally, the available industrial spaces are tending to remain on the market for longer periods before being leased, which may reflect shifting market dynamics or evolving tenant requirements.\n\nIn the context of Utah, rents for industrial space have remained relatively stable, with little change observed over recent periods. This stability in rental rates, combined with the low vacancy environment, highlights the resilience of the industrial space market in the region. Overall, INDUSTRIAL SPACE continues to be a vital and in-demand component of the commercial real estate sector, balancing strong occupancy with subtle shifts in leasing patterns and tenant behavior.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1769101904, "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_1a2c4a5ede", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 399, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
