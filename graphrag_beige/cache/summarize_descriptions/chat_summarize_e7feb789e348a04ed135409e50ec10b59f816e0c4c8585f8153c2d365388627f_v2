These rates are an important indicator of the health and dynamics of the industrial real estate sector. Currently, industrial vacancy rates are reported as low, indicating that most industrial spaces are occupied. However, there is a trend of the available space sitting on the market for longer periods before being leased or sold. Additionally, the proportion of unoccupied industrial properties has been increasing slightly, suggesting a gradual rise in vacancy rates. This combination of low overall vacancy but increasing duration of availability and a slight upward trend in unoccupied properties highlights a subtle shift in the industrial real estate market, where demand remains strong but may be softening compared to previous periods.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1769101896, "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_1a2c4a5ede", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 149, "prompt_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 332, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
