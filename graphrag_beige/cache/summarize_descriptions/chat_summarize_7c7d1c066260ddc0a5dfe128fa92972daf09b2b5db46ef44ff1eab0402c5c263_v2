For auto dealers, inventory levels have remained healthy, indicating a stable supply of vehicles available to meet consumer demand. In contrast, manufacturers have experienced a continued shrinkage in their inventory levels, suggesting a tightening supply chain or increased sales outpacing production. In the real estate sector, particularly in Florida and within speculative home construction, inventory levels of unsold goods or properties have been reported as elevated. This indicates a surplus of available homes or properties in these markets, potentially reflecting overbuilding or slower-than-expected sales. Overall, INVENTORY LEVELS vary by industry and region, with auto dealers maintaining stable supplies, manufacturers facing decreasing inventories, and certain real estate markets experiencing higher-than-normal unsold inventories.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1769101864, "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_1a2c4a5ede", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 346, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
