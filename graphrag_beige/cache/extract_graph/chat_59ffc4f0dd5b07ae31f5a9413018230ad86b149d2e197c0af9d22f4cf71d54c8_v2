Nonresidential construction activity continued to record slight declines this period, despite continued growth in activity related to data centers, according to contacts. One contact reported that uncertainty surrounding the status of federal funding continued to slow previously planned projects.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia > Credit Conditions\n\nThe volume of bank lending (excluding credit cards) declined moderately during the period (not seasonally adjusted)—weaker than the modest growth observed during the comparable period in 2024. Bank lending held steady in the prior period.\n\nThe moderate decline in lending was largely driven by a continued strong decline in commercial and industrial lending and a modest decline in commercial real estate loans, according to District banks. Meanwhile, consumer lending (excluding auto lending and credit cards) rose strongly, home equity lines increased moderately, auto loans rose modestly, and mortgages ticked up slightly. Credit card volumes decreased modestly, down from a slight increase during the same period one year ago.\n\nBanking contacts reported weaker loan demand, particularly from commercial clients. These contacts attributed the slowdown to businesses' unwillingness to make long-term investment decisions in such an uncertain cost environment. One lender noted that many commercial clients were paying down lines of credit and looking to keep more cash on hand. Most banking contacts continued to report strong credit quality overall, despite a slight rise in delinquencies and defaults.\n\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit: https://www.philadelphiafed.org/regional-economy.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Summary of Economic Activity\n\nFourth District contact reports suggested flat business activity in recent weeks, but contacts expected activity to increase modestly in the months ahead. Commercial construction and financial services contacts noted an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates. Manufacturers reported modest declines in demand for goods, a situation which they attributed to tariffs and trade-policy uncertainty, and consumer spending declined slightly. On balance, contacts said that their employment levels increased slightly and that wage pressures grew modestly. Nonlabor cost pressures remained robust, and selling prices continued to grow modestly.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Labor Markets\n\nOverall, contact reports suggested a slight increase in employment levels in recent weeks. Many contacts across industries said that they were hiring for open positions and normal turnover. Other contacts were hiring for current or anticipated growth. For instance, one banker reported hiring loan originators in anticipation of lower mortgage rates increasing demand. Overall, retailers held staffing levels steady in recent weeks. As one restaurateur stated, \"no growth so no new positions will be added.\" Across industries, many contacts said that declining business activity led to reduced labor demand, and in some cases, to layoffs. One manufacturer said that they had postponed layoffs while waiting for industrial production to recover but could not delay cuts any longer.\n\nOn balance, wage pressures were modest in recent weeks. Contacts across various industries reported implementing wage increases as part of their scheduled annual adjustments, while contacts in banking and professional and business services said that they had raised wages because of persistent competition in the labor market. Still, wage pressures eased for other contacts. Several manufacturers held wages steady because of lack of profitability, and one restaurateur aimed to hire at as close to minimum wage as possible to bring down overall costs.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Prices\n\nOverall, nonlabor input costs rose at a robust pace in recent weeks, continuing the trend seen in the prior three reporting periods. Tariffs were frequently cited as drivers of these cost increases across industries. Many manufacturers reported tariff-related cost increases on raw materials, imported components, and chemical inputs. Retail contacts noted tariff-driven cost increases on vehicles, beef, coffee, and chocolate. Two contacts noted that foreign producers were factoring in tariffs and cutting prices accordingly to retain market share. Beyond tariffs, banking and professional and business services contacts continued to report elevated costs for technology and insurance, and manufacturers reported rising utilities costs. In general, costs were expected to grow at a strong pace in the coming months.\n\nContacts generally indicated that selling prices rose modestly in recent weeks, maintaining the pace of growth seen since early 2025. Across industries, contacts continued implementing price increases to cover elevated input costs, with several manufacturers and wholesalers introducing surcharges to cover additional costs related to tariffs. However, pricing power was constrained for other contacts who faced declining demand and heightened price sensitivity. In response, many retail contacts noted offering discounts or raising prices only on select items, while some manufacturers said that they held prices steady despite increased costs to try to gain market share.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Consumer Spending\n\nConsumer spending declined slightly in recent weeks, and contacts expected demand to be flat in the coming months. Several retail stores reported a drop in unit sales, and a large retailer reported lower in-store and online traffic. Similarly, a food and hospitality contact said that customers were “more value aware,\" and another large retailer reported that tariff concerns continued to drag down customer sentiment. One tourism contact, who reported a year-over-year decline in activity, said that visits by Canadians fell by 50 percent. Auto dealers generally reported that sales were flat to down, except for used car sales, which one dealership expected to remain strong in the coming months.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Manufacturing\n\nOn balance, contacts reported that demand for manufactured goods declined modestly in recent weeks after changing little during the prior reporting period. Several manufacturers continued to attribute flat or weaker orders to import tariffs and persistent uncertainty about trade policy. Firms selling into industrial and agricultural equipment production reported particularly weak demand, and one contact added that orders from these producers were below their previous expectation by roughly 25 percent. By contrast, some firms selling into the fossil fuel industry and electricity generation reported higher orders related to data center construction and operation. Manufacturers generally expected demand to increase moderately in the coming months.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Real Estate and Construction\n\nRes\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4096, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_59ffc4f0dd5b07ae31f5a9413018230ad86b149d2e197c0af9d22f4cf71d54c8_v2"}
