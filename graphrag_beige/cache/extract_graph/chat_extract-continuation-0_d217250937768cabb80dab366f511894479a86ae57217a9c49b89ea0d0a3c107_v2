Several aspects of new property development fell, including the sales of construction materials, volume of construction underway, and prices for construction materials. Construction employment faced headwinds amid the slowdown in CRE and residential development activity. In contrast, construction of data centers in several parts of the District absorbed the availability of certain skilled workers. One labor leader noted construction of housing is constrained locally as any resident skilled workers were hired for data center construction. Financial aspects of CRE activity were largely unchanged with credit standards, access to credit, and load demand all reportedly stable. Though CRE activity fell over the past six months, the overall level of activity remains near its historical norm.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City > Community and Regional Banking\n\nDistrict banks noted little to no change in loan demand and credit standards across categories. Although overall loan quality continues to be sound, moderate deterioration in consumer lending portfolios was noted. Furthermore, the majority of respondents expect consumer lending portfolios to continue to face challenges over the next six months as disposable income levels decrease. Some respondents specified they expect customers with lower personal incomes or employed in industries driven by discretionary spending to be the most likely to face challenges. A modest increase in deposit levels was noted particularly in money market accounts and certificates of deposit, and respondents commented that customers are locking in interest rates ahead of any market rate decreases.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City > Energy\n\nTenth District oil and gas activity fell modestly. Nearly two-thirds of contacts reported steady drilling activity, while others saw declines. The number of active oil and gas rigs rose in Colorado and Wyoming but decreased slightly in Oklahoma as natural gas spot prices fell. Tenth District firms continued to report declining revenues and profits. However, oil prices have remained slightly above profitable levels, and some firms reported lower breakeven prices due to reduced regulatory compliance costs. Capital expenditures in the sector also declined further, with many firms citing heightened uncertainty as a headwind for investment. Contacts still anticipate natural gas prices will reach their breakeven price within the year, but do not expect that oil or gas prices will support a substantial increase in drilling activity in the foreseeable future.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City > Agriculture\n\nDisparities in the Tenth District agricultural economy persisted through the end of September. Profit opportunities for crop producers remained weak while conditions in livestock industries were considerably stronger, particularly for cattle producers. In a recent survey, over 80 percent of lenders in crop-heavy areas reported declines in farm income and working capital, compared to about 40 percent in areas with more cattle production. Agricultural credit conditions deteriorated gradually, and many lenders reported that weak conditions in the farm economy were having a modest negative effect on local economic conditions. Contacts remarked that strong cattle prices were supporting diversified operations but the weakness in crop profits were weighing heavily on farmer sentiment.\n\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit: https://www.KansasCityFed.org/research/regional-research.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Summary of Economic Activity\n\nEconomic activity in the Eleventh District was little changed over the reporting period. Growth in the manufacturing sector slowed to a modest pace, and activity contracted slightly in nonfinancial services. Retail sales fell. Housing market activity remained weak, and drilling activity and oil production were flat. Loan volume and demand rose modestly. Employment fell, and wage growth was modest. Price pressures were elevated in manufacturing, but subdued in the service sector, where firms expected selling price increases to accelerate over the next 12 months. Outlooks worsened with weakening demand, domestic policy uncertainty, and inflation cited as primary concerns going forward.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Labor Markets\n\nEmployment fell over the reporting period. Staffing firms reported slow activity as firms remained cautious with hiring and professionals were reluctant to switch positions. Head counts dipped further in the energy sector as companies continued to find ways to complete more wells in less time and with fewer people. Homebuilders and nonprofits noted trimming head counts. Overall, wage growth was modest. Firms expect wage growth to slow to 3.4 percent over the next 12 months, down from 3.8 percent over the past 12 months.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Prices\n\nSelling prices increased slightly overall, while rising more sharply in the manufacturing sector due to the widespread impact of tariffs. A computer manufacturer reported that U.S. customs was applying steel and aluminum tariffs to products that do not contain these metals and that challenges to these tariffs were taking time to resolve. A professional and business services firm reported that health-care and business insurance premiums were rising faster than revenues. Service firms expect selling price increases to accelerate over the next 12 months, while manufacturing executives expect price growth to remain steady.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Manufacturing\n\nFactory output growth slowed to a modest pace during the reporting period, and new orders dipped. Output growth abated for most durable goods, with machinery and transportation manufacturing being the bright spots. Among nondurables, food manufacturing continued to see strong gains, while chemical production held steady as trade policy and global oversupply put downward pressure on export demand for basic chemicals. Gulf Coast refineries cited a dip in production levels stemming from seasonality and unplanned outages. Contacts noted that steady global demand amid ongoing refinery closures and unplanned outages in Russia and Iran had propped up margins for refined products over the summer, especially for diesel and jet fuel. Perceptions of broader business conditions worsened in manufacturing as slowing demand, inflation, and domestic policy uncertainty continued to weigh on outlooks.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Retail Sales\n\nRetail sales fell during the reporting period. Building material and garden equipment, furniture, and electronic and appliance stores saw lower sales, while health care and food and beverage retailers reported flat to slight increases in activity. Auto dealers reported weak sales and tighter margins due to higher costs. Overall retail inventories remained steady\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KANSAS CITY<|>LOCATION<|>Kansas City is a major city in
