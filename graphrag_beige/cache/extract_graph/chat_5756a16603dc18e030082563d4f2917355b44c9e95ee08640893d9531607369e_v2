Multiple bank mergers were announced, affecting the banking landscape across the southeast.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta > Energy\n\nMost energy industry segments grew at a moderate pace over the reporting period. Crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico remained strong, despite reports of continued softening demand for various refined products. Liquefied natural gas demand rose globally and U.S. exports remained robust. Electricity demand was solid, particularly in the commercial and industrial sectors. Carbon capture and storage projects advanced over the reporting period, while solar development projects slowed down.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta > Agriculture\n\nWhile contacts noted that overall demand for agricultural products was healthy, trade policy volatility weighed on agricultural exports. Overseas sales of domestic rice declined as buyers sourced from other countries at lower prices. Crops such as soybean, wheat, and corn remained depressed while Chinese markets turned to Brazil for these commodities. However, domestic demand for beef, poultry, peanuts, and tobacco was strong. Dairy farmers noted flat year-over-year sales, though demand from food services providers (e.g. cruise lines, resorts, and restaurants) was \"on fire,\" and retail dairy sales were stable.\n\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit: https://www.atlantafed.org/economy-matters/regional-economics.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Summary of Economic Activity\n\nEconomic activity in the Seventh District was little changed over the reporting period, and contacts expected a slight decrease in activity over the next year. Consumer spending increased modestly; construction and real estate activity increased slightly; employment was flat; nonbusiness contacts saw no change in activity; business spending declined slightly; and manufacturing activity declined modestly. Prices rose moderately, wages were up modestly, and financial conditions loosened slightly. Prospects for 2025 farm income were unchanged.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Labor Markets\n\nEmployment was flat over the reporting period, though contacts expected a slight pickup over the next 12 months. Reports on labor market conditions continued to be mixed. Job turnover was low, and contacts across many industries observed softening labor market conditions. An employment placement agency reported a continued decline in demand from manufacturers, and one contact in state government observed that previously announced layoffs in agricultural machinery manufacturing had been completed. A retail industry analyst expected that hiring for the holiday season would be weaker than last year. A few contacts in manufacturing and construction said they were looking to hire new workers. One noted that fear of immigration enforcement was reducing labor availability. Another contact said that revoked visas for workers at a local factory created the need to rehire for those positions. Wages and benefits costs were up modestly overall, and many contacts cited increases in health insurance premiums.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Prices\n\nPrices rose moderately in late August and September and contacts expected a similar pace of growth over the next 12 months. Nonlabor input costs rose moderately, with contacts highlighting higher costs for energy and raw materials like aluminum, copper, and steel. Manufacturing contacts attributed the increases in metals prices to tariffs. In contrast, several contacts in the construction industry noted no change in input prices in recent weeks. Overall, producer and consumer prices rose moderately. One retail industry analyst said that, in general, retailers were trying to hold off passing tariff-related cost increases on to consumers for as long as possible, though several smaller retailers reported already raising prices because of tariffs.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Consumer Spending\n\nConsumer spending increased modestly over the reporting period. Contacts reported a healthy back-to-school shopping season as well as strong increases in spending on appliances, computers, and landscaping. However, spending on other consumer electronics and building materials declined some. Leisure and hospitality sales were mixed, with softness in some travel-related categories, including airlines and hotels, but increased spending at restaurants in the fast food, fast casual, and family dining segments. New light vehicle sales were brisk, reflecting a combination of strong underlying demand and the end of tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases. Used vehicle sales remained steady, though dealerships located in low-to-moderate income communities reported softer demand.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Business Spending\n\nBusiness spending declined slightly in late August and September. Capital expenditures fell slightly and expectations for the coming year also decreased. Demand for truck transportation edged down, though freight rates increased slightly. One contact in the trucking industry called current conditions \"recession-like.\" Retail inventories were lean, stocks of vehicles were lower, and manufacturing inventories were a little high.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Construction and Real Estate\n\nConstruction and real estate activity increased slightly on balance over the reporting period. Residential construction edged up. Residential real estate activity was unchanged; prices were flat and rents increased modestly. One contact felt that the single-family market had shifted from being a seller's market to \"barely a seller's market\" amidst an increase in inventory and stable demand. Contacts noted that in the multifamily sector rent concessions for new tenants had become more common. Nonresidential construction increased slightly as demand remained robust for data centers and health-care facilities. Commercial real estate activity also increased slightly. Leasing activity in the office sector picked up and demand from restaurant groups remained solid. Prices and rents were unchanged. Contacts noted that sellers have brought down asking prices for properties, opening the door for some movement in the market. Vacancy rates and the availability of sublease space both grew slightly. Some contacts indicated that while industrial vacancy rates were low the space that is available is sitting longer. Separately, more warehouse inventory was available.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing\n\nManufacturing demand declined modestly in late August and September. Steel orders were flat overall. A few contacts noted some reshoring of steel production. Fabricated metals demand was unchanged on balance, as higher sales to a range of sectors was offset by lower sales to the construction and automotive industries. Machinery orders decreased moderately,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4096, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_5756a16603dc18e030082563d4f2917355b44c9e95ee08640893d9531607369e_v2"}
