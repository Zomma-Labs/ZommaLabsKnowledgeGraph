An engine-parts manufacturer noted that customers had shifted to cheaper parts or were using existing parts for longer periods. An office equipment manufacturer observed an uptick in customers refinancing their equipment rather than purchasing new ones. Several firms highlighted the negative impact of the housing market on their business, particularly those in the construction and furniture industries. A furniture manufacturer reported increased operational challenges due to decreased demand coupled with tariffs increasing their prices.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond > Ports and Transportation\n\nOverall volumes at Fifth District maritime ports increased slightly this cycle reflecting a pull forward in retail holiday ordering after some tariffs were delayed. Auto imports remained steady month over month with no uptick in requests for auto storage space as the inventory was moving through the market. Increased carrier capacity to the East Coast and historically low demand has put downward pressure on spot rates, which continued to decrease this cycle. Volumes for freight moving over the road had an unseasonal decline in August, continuing the downward trend that began in the spring. One contact noted a continued deterioration of business levels and pricing offered by competitors in a \"race to the bottom until it breaks.\" Another contact shared that fuel surcharges have helped their daily revenues, but acknowledged that it ultimately \"takes a bite out of the household budget\" and the firm would rather see fuel prices go down and for cargo volumes to increase.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond > Retail, Travel, and Tourism\n\nOn balance, consumer spending increased modestly in recent weeks. Some small higher-end retailers reported solid growth in sales. Restaurants in the luxury and quick service categories also reported solid revenue growth. In contrast, casual sit-down restaurants reported a softening in sales. A retailer in North Carolina noted that customers were clearly looking for value and comparative price shopping in their stores. Companies tied to new home construction reported soft activity, however a replacement window company reported strong sales, which was attributed to homeowners opting to renovate rather than sell their homes. A furniture store saw less traffic and fewer sales and was concerned that recently announced tariffs would further reduce demand in the near future. Reports from tourism and travel businesses were mixed. Hotels in some parts of the Fifth District saw increased occupancy and revenues and attributed the growth to leisure and sports-related travel. Several hotels in the greater Washington, D.C. area, on the other hand, reported lower occupancy rates as business travel for conferences and worker trainings declined.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond > Real Estate and Construction\n\nResidential real estate activity was relatively flat, even as inventories improved and prices began to stabilize. A real estate agent from North Carolina reported that \"45 percent of listings experienced price reductions due to initial overpricing.\" In addition, a Virginia agent observed that \"pricing is finally feeling right after five years of strong growth.\" Buyers continue to meet qualification criteria, particularly with added incentives lowering rates for new construction. However, as a Maryland developer pointed out, affordability remains a significant issue. Builders noted that they are completing existing projects and beginning to pull back on new starts as uncertainty and tariff fears continue.\n\nCommercial real estate activity experienced a slight uptick, though a Virginia broker described the situation as \"murky.\" Agents throughout the District stated that retail space and medical offices were performing well, whereas big box and office spaces encountered difficulties. As flight to quality persisted, brokers across the District were concerned about Class B offices and lower-tier properties challenges, potentially leading to receivership. A Maryland broker remarked: “these buildings, in their current condition, won't sell for yesterday's prices.\" A South Carolina broker echoed concerns, highlighting that the high cost of upfitting is prohibitive and that “the math doesn't work.\"\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond > Banking and Finance\n\nFinancial institutions continued to report stable demand for most loan types, with some institutions noting a modest increase in demand within their commercial loan portfolio. However, one banker did note there is still a \"sideline mentality\" with many borrowers that are still awaiting more certainty in the overall economy and rates. Deposit levels continued to be stable, but some competition for balances is beginning to creep back into the marketplace. A few institutions observed a modest increase in loan delinquencies, mainly within their consumer loan portfolios, including mortgages and home equity loans.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond > Nonfinancial Services\n\nNonfinancial service providers continued to report stable demand for their services, but uncertainty continued to be a common thread throughout most of their comments. For example, a design firm described their customers as being cautious with any future growth plans. Several staffing firms reported that demand for their services had decreased and that their pool of potential applicants grew. A variety of firms, and their clients, continued to delay plans for expansion until more certainty was found within the economy.\n\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit: https://www.richmondfed.org/research/data_analysis.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta > Summary of Economic Activity\n\nEconomic activity in the Sixth District was little changed. Employment levels were flat, and wages rose modestly. Prices increased at a moderate pace. Consumer spending fell somewhat, and leisure travel continued to soften. Activity in residential real estate declined, though commercial real estate was generally unchanged. Transportation declined modestly, but manufacturing picked up slightly. Loan growth was flat across the District. Energy activity expanded moderately, and agriculture conditions were mostly healthy.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta > Labor Markets\n\nEmployment levels in the District were generally flat over the reporting period. Several firms described what one dubbed a \"hiring chill,\" suggesting welcomed attrition and fewer head count additions in areas of growth. Turnover was low, with many describing the level as the lowest in their firm's history, and applicants for open positions were plentiful except for very specific, mostly technical, roles. Recently, however, head count reductions were cited more frequently, and some firms expect further cuts based on early Generative Al\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4096, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ffff517783170228b1cf5e211059314ff7ea085f061d6a951f889de12e11b991_v2"}
