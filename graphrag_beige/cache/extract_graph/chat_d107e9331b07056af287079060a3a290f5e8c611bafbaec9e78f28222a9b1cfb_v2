Contacts were quite optimistic, expecting further healthy revenue growth in the coming months.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Commercial Real Estate\n\nCommercial real estate activity was up slightly net of seasonal factors. Contacts were encouraged by the seasonal uptick in leasing activity after Labor Day, as some were not sure it would materialize, and the Boston market was buoyed by some large office deals. Nonetheless, office rents were flat, while operating costs continued to rise. The retail sector experienced stable leasing activity, with modest rent growth and low vacancies. Industrial leasing and sales activity were stable. Apartment rents rose only slightly, representing a slowdown from earlier in the year. Construction costs continued to face upward pressure from tariffs and labor shortages, and construction activity remained limited. The outlook was cautiously optimistic on balance, representing an improvement from the summer. Contacts expected that more widespread return-to-office policies would boost office leasing going forward, and the recent reduction in the federal funds rate lifted sentiment somewhat. Still, pessimism lingered concerning rents.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Residential Real Estate\n\nClosed sales of single-family homes were flat or down slightly overall (as of August), despite rising by modest to large margins in the northern New England states, all compared with the previous August. Condo sales increased slightly across the First District on average, but results varied widely across states. House prices rose moderately on average from a year earlier, representing somewhat slower growth than in the previous report, and condo prices fell modestly in some areas. Inventories increased sharply from the previous August, extending a trend that began earlier in the year. According to a Massachusetts contact, buyers became increasingly selective and patient, especially in the condo market. Contacts were hopeful that mortgage rates might fall in the coming months, potentially improving affordability and sales.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Community Perspectives\n\nContacts expressed increased anxiety and uncertainty regarding the economic situation of low- and moderate-income households in the First District. The prevalence of economic precarity increased in many communities, as evidenced by greater food pantry use and increased difficulty paying rent, utilities, and other bills. Consumers increasingly used savings to cover basic needs and took steps to reduce spending where possible. Planned cuts to SNAP and Medicaid, as well as further increases in consumer prices linked to tariffs, posed additional risks to low- and moderate-income households going forward. New England continued to face workforce housing shortages, and rising construction costs pushed against further development of such housing.\n\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit: https://www.bostonfed.org/in-the-region.aspx.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of New York > Summary of Economic Activity\n\nEconomic activity in the Second District continued to decline slightly. On balance, employment held steady during the reporting period, and wage growth remained modest. The pace of price increases remained elevated but was little changed, with selling prices rising moderately and input prices rising strongly. Manufacturing activity was little changed after a summer uptick. Consumer spending increased modestly, in part due to the resilience of mid- to upper-income households. Housing markets remained solid. Overall loan demand declined. Businesses did not expect much of an increase in activity in the months ahead.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of New York > Labor Markets\n\nOn balance, employment remained steady during the reporting period. Firms in wholesale, finance, business services, and personal services reported slight-to-modest upticks in head counts, while education and health care, retail, construction, and transportation firms reported fairly significant declines.\n\nLabor supply continued to exceed labor demand. Contacts reported that it has been consistently easier to find workers, continuing a trend that has been in place all year. Attrition remained exceptionally low, creating less need to hire for replacement. Labor demand varied by industry, with solid demand for workers in finance and accounting alongside still-soft demand for tech workers. Several businesses in construction and leisure and hospitality reported some difficulty finding workers due to shifts in immigration policy. A large retailer reported that instead of making workforce adjustments through hiring and firing, they were repositioning longer-tenured workers to increase productivity. While some firms were strategically downsizing, there remained no signs of major layoffs.\n\nWage growth remained modest on balance. Firms in construction, leisure and hospitality, wholesale, and education saw strong growth in wages, while wage growth slowed to a slight pace in finance. Contacts anticipated acceleration in wage growth in the coming months.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of New York > Prices\n\nThe pace of price increases was mostly unchanged; selling prices continued to rise moderately while input prices again rose strongly. Many businesses continued to strategize around how to structure prices in consideration of new tariffs. One major retailer reported adjusting price increases based on the demand elasticity for each item, and many reported working with vendors to find alternative inputs to mitigate the impact of tariffs on their costs. A Long Island area importer and wholesaler of auto parts noted that tariffs on goods imported from India presented particularly steep challenges to their business, while a coffee roaster and supplier noted that tariffs on imports from Brazil threatened their ability to remain profitable. A specialty appliance manufacturer from upstate New York hiked their prices for the second time this year to account for the impact of tariffs on their costs. An upstate brewing company reported that elevated ingredient and packaging material costs were getting passed along to the consumer. A pharmaceutical company reported that foreign manufacturers were absorbing tariff costs to maintain market share and production levels. Some restaurants noted escalating costs for food—particularly beef—and imported wine were hurting their businesses. A New York City-based specialty contractor reported that congestion pricing was pushing up the cost of doing business considerably. Looking ahead, firms expect significant pricing pressures to persist.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of New York > Consumer Spending\n\nConsumer spending increased modestly throughout much of the District. A department store reported that store sales had continued to strengthen and were outperforming the same stores last year, due in part to resilience among mid- to upper-income consumers.
