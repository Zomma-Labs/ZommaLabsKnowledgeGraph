Separately, more warehouse inventory was available.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Manufacturing\n\nManufacturing demand declined modestly in late August and September. Steel orders were flat overall. A few contacts noted some reshoring of steel production. Fabricated metals demand was unchanged on balance, as higher sales to a range of sectors was offset by lower sales to the construction and automotive industries. Machinery orders decreased moderately, driven by a decline in demand from the auto sector. Auto production was down modestly, while heavy truck production was flat.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Banking and Finance\n\nFinancial conditions loosened slightly in late August and September. Bond and equity values rose a bit, while volatility remained unchanged. Business loan demand decreased slightly on net, with one contact citing a decline in acquisition activity. Business loan quality declined modestly, as multiple contacts noted weaknesses among suppliers in the auto industry. Business loan rates moved down, but terms tightened. In the consumer sector, loan demand increased slightly, with a few contacts noting a pickup in mortgage refinancing. Loan quality remained flat and rates edged down, but terms tightened slightly.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Agriculture\n\nNet farm income prospects for the District were unchanged over the reporting period, though elevated uncertainty continued to unsettle agricultural operators. Corn and soybean fields were in good shape across most of the District. Dry conditions assisted harvest but hurt yields in some places; in addition, crop disease trimmed yields a bit. Fruit and vegetable production was subpar for most products. Soybean prices were lower, in part due to the absence of new-crop exports to China. Corn prices were down despite strong export volumes. Cattle and hog prices increased to record territory, while milk and egg prices declined. Concerns about higher input costs for 2026 intensified due to rising fertilizer prices. Farm operations, particularly crop producers, have already cut costs, with a contact saying, \"there is limited flexibility left to further reduce expenses.\" Contacts noted that lack of clarity on the economic outlook was putting a damper on capital investment, such as equipment purchases and repairs.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Community Conditions\n\nCommunity, nonprofit, and other nonbusiness contacts reported no change in activity over the reporting period and noted ongoing uncertainty about economic conditions. State government contacts noted modest year-over-year increases in sales tax revenue. Workforce development contacts who support individuals facing barriers to employment reported that firms had become more \"selective” in hiring, as existing workers were more likely to stay in their current jobs and employers weren't as eager to fill empty positions. In planning for 2026, many nonprofit organizations anticipated the need to find new funding streams and adapt to smaller budgets. Social service contacts reported that increased operating costs, such as for insurance, combined with reduced income and donations, were causing them to think carefully about which services to prioritize.\n\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit: https://chicagofed.org/cfsec.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis > Summary of Economic Activity\n\nEconomic activity and employment levels have remained unchanged since our previous report. Contacts continue to report that immigration policies have been resulting in labor shortages. Prices have increased moderately, with contacts reporting that inflation is eroding consumer purchasing power. Banking activity has remained unchanged since our previous report, with overall credit conditions remaining strong. Agriculture conditions are strained and have further deteriorated. The outlook remains slightly pessimistic.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis > Labor Markets\n\nEmployment has remained unchanged since our previous report. Most contacts reported no change to employment levels; they are not hiring, but also not laying off workers. A manufacturer in Louisville reported no change in employment levels since July and is currently postponing the filling of roles until the first quarter of 2026. Contacts in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture continue to report labor shortages due to workers not reporting to work because of fears of deportation. For example, a construction firm in Memphis reported that the reduced labor pool was driving up labor costs and resulting in project delays.\n\nWage growth has been moderate. An apparel retailer reported employment and compensation growth expected at 3.0 percent to 3.5 percent for this year. A regional airport implemented a 4 percent cost-of-living adjustment—the first in six or seven years—alongside a significant increase in employer contributions to the health insurance program.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis > Prices\n\nPrices have increased moderately since our previous report. A technology firm in Memphis has reported maintaining stable prices but has reduced its price guarantee periods to 30 days. An apparel firm in Memphis expects overall price increases of around three percent, with some items such as uniforms rising 5 percent due to input cost increases. Several contacts reported an increase in grocery food prices, especially beef. A professional services firm in St. Louis reported increasing the prices they charge to customers due to tariffs and competitors also raising their prices. Contacts reported that price increases were not solely due to tariffs but also insurance premiums, utilities, and opportunism. A manufacturer reported slightly increasing their prices to customers as suppliers' costs had increased despite having a primarily domestic supply chain.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis > Consumer Spending\n\nConsumer spending has slightly declined, and businesses are anxious about the upcoming holiday season. While upper-income households and corporate clients continue to spend on travel, events, and luxury services, middle-income consumers are increasingly cautious as they have been using credit to maintain their spending levels. Community contacts report rising food pantry usage among both low- and middle-income households, growing reliance on \"buy now, pay later\" services, and elevated credit card delinquency rates. A hotel owner in Missouri reported that travel demand had dipped in the past few months, especially among middle-class consumers, and described the current environment as a “middle-class recession” that is affecting select-service hotels.
