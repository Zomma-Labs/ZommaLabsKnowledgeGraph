A New York City-based specialty contractor reported that congestion pricing was pushing up the cost of doing business considerably. Looking ahead, firms expect significant pricing pressures to persist.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of New York > Consumer Spending\n\nConsumer spending increased modestly throughout much of the District. A department store reported that store sales had continued to strengthen and were outperforming the same stores last year, due in part to resilience among mid- to upper-income consumers. Apparel has been selling well, and sales of cosmetics and fragrances remained strong. Still, a food store from Long Island reported that sales were muted amid elevated costs for produce and meat. Auto dealers in upstate New York reported that sales edged up slightly as conditions continued to normalize after tariff-related volatility earlier in the year. Despite some softening in used car sales and concerns about affordability, dealers were optimistic in the face of solid demand and healthy inventory levels.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of New York > Manufacturing and Distribution\n\nManufacturing activity was little changed after a summer uptick. New orders were down, and shipments were mostly unchanged. Some manufacturers of electrical equipment, machinery, and instruments noted improving sales in the reporting period. Still, uncertainty relating to tariffs continued to weigh on manufacturers who faced elevated input prices and some difficulty procuring equipment and materials. An upstate manufacturer of kegs temporarily ceased production due to high steel prices. Some manufacturing contacts reported that overseas demand for U.S.-manufactured goods had dropped due to shifting international trade dynamics. Supply availability worsened, though delivery times were little changed. Inventories continued to shrink. Capital spending plans were soft. Activity declined among wholesale and distribution firms. Manufacturers expect conditions to improve in the months ahead.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of New York > Services\n\nActivity in the service sector continued to decline moderately this period. Firms in the retail, leisure and hospitality, and business services sectors reported moderate declines, and firms in the information sector reported a particularly sharp contraction. A contact from a security services firm in the New York City metro area reported that while business activity had been steady, there were fewer opportunities for government contract bids.\n\nWhile domestic tourism continued to grow in New York City, a modest decline in international visitors, who tend to spend more than domestic tourists, has taken a toll on attractions and restaurants. Attendance at Broadway shows remained solid, while activity was flat to down slightly at the city's other cultural attractions. Demand for hotel rooms continued to edge up during the busy September season, nearing levels last seen in 2019, with room rates remaining exceptionally high.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of New York > Real Estate and Construction\n\nHousing markets remained solid across the District, though inventory remained at low levels. New listings slowed to a trickle in the New York City area, though new signed contracts edged up. With solid demand and low inventory across the District, prices continued to push upwards. Some contacts from the Rochester area reported that capacity-constrained electricity infrastructure prevented some communities from building new housing developments. Desirable properties continued to sell above asking price and often within days of hitting the market.\n\nRents continued to rise, and New York City rents were at historic highs. Still, with some easing in mortgage rates, contacts anticipated some reduction in rental demand in the coming months.\n\nCommercial real estate markets continue to improve. New York City's office market remained stronger than many other large cities, although some of this strength was driven by a few large transactions. Al firms were increasingly seeking office space in New York City. Activity in the industrial sector was muted due to uncertainty around interest rates and tariffs. Demand for retail space was bifurcated, with the luxury end of the retail market in Manhattan remaining particularly resilient but other parts of the market were weak. Construction activity continued to decline.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of New York > Banking and Finance\n\nActivity in the broad finance sector weakened slightly after a modest improvement during the previous period. Small-to-medium sized banks reported that while demand for consumer loans and commercial mortgages held steady, overall loan demand declined due to sagging demand for business loans. By contrast, bankers reported moderate growth in demand for residential mortgages, with strong lending volumes. Credit standards tightened. Delinquency rates worsened slightly, especially for business loans.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of New York > Community Perspectives\n\nMany nonprofits are facing challenges due to unpredictable funding and a reduction in federal benefit programs. A community health-care center reported that financial distress among Medicaid patients has risen, limiting patients' access to care and straining the organization's finances. More generally, rising business costs, including insurance, added to financial pressures for community service providers.\n\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit: https://www.newyorkfed.org/regional-economy.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia > Summary of Economic Activity\n\nEconomic activity in the Third District increased slightly after rising modestly in the prior period. Nonmanufacturing activity increased slightly. Non-auto retailers and auto dealers reported a slight decline in activity, noting tepid demand from consumers. Meanwhile, manufacturing activity rose moderately. Employment levels rose slightly during the period, while wage growth remained near its modest pre-pandemic rate. Prices continued to rise moderately. Firms continued to report increased cost pressures from tariffs and other business expenses and to expect to raise prices in the coming months to offset these higher costs. Firms expect a modest increase in activity over the next six months, although contacts across industries warned of additional downside risks of a prolonged government shutdown. Manufacturers were more optimistic than nonmanufacturers about growth over the next six months.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia > Labor Markets\n\nEmployment appeared to increase slightly this period following no change in the last period. Based on our September surveys, full-time employment rose for both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms. However, more than two-thirds of all firms reported no change in full-time employment, higher than the historical average. Part-time employment declined for nonmanufacturers.\n\nOverall, our staffing contacts reported demand\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4096, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_43b84eb17e16e093f048df7ed1ab888c6d73f85944e097467cd2c38f992ecbb6_v2"}
