Firms selling into industrial and agricultural equipment production reported particularly weak demand, and one contact added that orders from these producers were below their previous expectation by roughly 25 percent. By contrast, some firms selling into the fossil fuel industry and electricity generation reported higher orders related to data center construction and operation. Manufacturers generally expected demand to increase moderately in the coming months.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Real Estate and Construction\n\nResidential construction and real estate contacts reported declining demand in recent weeks. One real estate broker noted that current homeowners remained reluctant to sell and lose their lower mortgage interest rates. By contrast, one homebuilder reported that demand for new homes continued to be strong. On balance, contacts anticipated flat demand in the coming months.\n\nContacts in the commercial construction and real estate industry saw a modest increase in demand over the last two months. Reports from real estate developers and a commercial builder indicated that firms undertook more capital spending as they adapted to tariffs and as short-term interest rates declined. Notably, one contact said that some multinational manufacturers were expanding their domestic capacity, spurring new construction activity. However, other commercial real estate contacts reported softening demand for consumer-facing properties, including hotels, restaurants, and apartments. On balance, contacts expected moderate growth in demand over the near term.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Financial Services\n\nOverall, bankers indicated that loan demand increased moderately in recent weeks, as both households and businesses were encouraged by lower interest rates. One commercial banker also reported that loan demand increased as their clients gained clarity around tariff impacts. Looking ahead, bankers expected a sharp increase in loan demand driven by anticipated cuts to interest rates over the remainder of the year. However, some bankers cited persistent inflation and small upticks in unemployment as sources of economic uncertainty keeping loan demand weak. Bankers also indicated that both core deposits and overall delinquency rates were flat.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Nonfinancial Services\n\nProfessional and business services firms reported moderate demand growth in recent weeks and expected a similar pace of growth over the coming months. Both a software and an accounting firm attributed increased demand to changes in the administration's rules and tax laws. While demand for one firm's legal services remained steady, the firm's retail clients were being cautious about new capital investments and acquisitions. On balance, freight contacts reported flat demand and expected modest growth over the coming months, and one contact noted higher shipments of goods warehoused during the pre-tariff import surge. An airport reported declines in passenger and cargo volumes.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland > Community Conditions\n\nIn a semiannual survey of nonprofits, a growing share of respondents indicated that funding for their respective organizations decreased over the past six months. One revealed that their organization had to dip into its reserve fund to cover operating expenses for the first time in more than ten years. Another respondent said that the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions because of uncertainty around federal grants. Respondents who assist jobseekers observed that their clients were more likely than before to receive offers for part-time positions with little or no benefits and that formerly incarcerated jobseekers were having a harder time securing employment.\n\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit: https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/region/regional-analysis.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond > Summary of Economic Activity\n\nThe Fifth District economy continued to grow modestly this cycle. Consumer spending at retail and restaurants grew modestly while reports on travel spending were mixed. Consumers were looking for value and comparative price shopping. Manufacturing activity declined slightly amid customer uncertainty and price sensitivity leading some to adjust product offerings to reduce prices. Additionally, ports volumes increased slightly, reflecting early retail ordering for holiday inventories. Activity in the remaining sectors was generally flat. Employment was unchanged, on balance, with firms both growing and cutting labor based on demand. Wage growth remained moderate. Price growth picked up somewhat in manufacturing, with firms citing tariffs, but overall year-over-year price growth remained within a moderate range.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond > Labor Markets\n\nEmployment in the Fifth District, on balance, was unchanged in the most recent period. A few firms grew their total head count through acquisitions and expansions into new locations. Several other firms, on the other hand, reported reducing their head count to right-size labor with slowing demand. A couple of firms expected cuts to come. For example, a South Carolina home builder reported a decline in demand due to increased prices, which they said would result in imminent layoffs. Additionally, a small jewelry store is contemplating closing due to economic uncertainty and declining demand. Labor availability continued to be a significant challenge for skilled trades. In response, a concrete manufacturer launched their first social media recruitment campaign, hoping to attract a larger pool of applicants. Wage growth remained moderate.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond > Prices\n\nOn balance, year-over-year price growth remained moderate this cycle. According to our most recent surveys, service sector firms reported virtually no change in price growth while manufacturers saw a slight increase in prices received. Firms in both sectors continued to cite tariffs adding to their input costs, some of which have yet to be passed along to customers. A couple of firms said they expected to raise prices once they worked through their pre-tariff inventory.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond > Manufacturing\n\nManufacturing activity in the Fifth District declined slightly in the recent reporting period. Contacts reported increased customer price sensitivity. In response, a fuse box manufacturer reconfigured their products to cut costs and lower their prices. An engine-parts manufacturer noted that customers had shifted to cheaper parts or were using existing parts for longer periods. An office equipment manufacturer observed an uptick in customers refinancing their equipment rather than purchasing new ones. Several firms highlighted the negative impact of the housing market on their business, particularly those in the construction and furniture industries. A furniture manufacturer reported increased operational challenges due to decreased demand coupled with tariffs increasing their prices\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CLEVELAND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland is one of the regional banks in the Federal Reserve System, responsible for monitoring and reporting on economic conditions in its district, including sectors such as real estate, construction, financial services, nonfinancial services, and community conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF RICHMOND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond is a regional bank in the Federal Reserve System, overseeing economic activity in the Fifth District, including monitoring sectors such as manufacturing, labor markets, prices, and consumer spending.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TARIFFS<|>POLICY<|>Tariffs are government-imposed duties on imported goods, affecting input costs, demand, and business strategies across multiple industries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEREST RATES<|>ECONOMIC_INDICATOR<|>Interest rates refer to the cost of borrowing money, influencing loan demand, capital spending, and consumer behavior.
