Perceptions of broader business conditions worsened in manufacturing as slowing demand, inflation, and domestic policy uncertainty continued to weigh on outlooks.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Retail Sales\n\nRetail sales fell during the reporting period. Building material and garden equipment, furniture, and electronic and appliance stores saw lower sales, while health care and food and beverage retailers reported flat to slight increases in activity. Auto dealers reported weak sales and tighter margins due to higher costs. Overall retail inventories remained steady. Outlooks were pessimistic and tariffs appeared to be one of the primary drivers of uncertainty among contacts.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Nonfinancial Services\n\nActivity in nonfinancial services contracted slightly during the reporting period. A pickup was seen in professional and business services and transportation and warehousing, while health care, information, and leisure and hospitality exhibited weakness. Port traffic and small parcel shipments volumes rose, according to contacts. Airlines reported broad-based increases in passenger demand, highlighting domestic travel as a source of strength. Demand for staffing services was stable, and outlooks were optimistic, attributable to clients having unspent budgets for 2025 as they have been holding off on hiring for longer than usual. Service sector outlooks worsened, and uncertainty remained a headwind.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Construction and Real Estate\n\nHousing market activity remained weak. Foot traffic and sales continued to be choppy and lackluster despite the recent dip in mortgage rates. Home inventories fell slightly during the reporting period but remained elevated. Builders noted ongoing reliance on marketing and incentives, including discounting and mortgage rate buydowns, to close deals. Home starts slowed further, and vacant developed lot supply was rising. Outlooks remained pessimistic amid sluggish demand and elevated economic uncertainty.\n\nCommercial real estate activity improved. Apartment demand was steady, but elevated supply of new units has made leasing competitive and kept rental rates under pressure. Office leasing improved, and contacts said there appeared to be more signs of stability. Industrial and retail activity remained solid. Outlooks remained cautious. Firms were signing short-term leases because of heightened uncertainty, and investment sales activity continued to be limited.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Financial Services\n\nLoan volume and demand increased in September. Credit tightening continued, but loan pricing declined. Credit standards and terms eased slightly for residential real estate loans while tightening continued for the remaining loan types. Over the next three months, bankers expect to tighten credit standards for all loan types except residential real estate, which are expected to be unchanged. Overall loan performance deteriorated slightly; however, loan performance for commercial real estate sharply improved. Bankers reported stable general business activity. Bankers' outlooks are mixed. Survey respondents expect an acceleration in loan demand and increasing business activity six months from now but a moderate deterioration in loan performance.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Energy\n\nDrilling and well completion activity was flat over the past six weeks. Producers remained concerned about low oil prices, and reiterated that without a material increase in prices, U.S. crude production would erode in 2026. Breakeven costs for wells were rising due to increases in input costs. An oil field service contact noted there were \"a lot of rigs stacked in yards waiting to become spare parts.\" Several firms noted project delays due to low oil prices and an uncertain policy environment, but pipeline contacts were optimistic about their project pipelines crediting regulatory relief and favorable tax policies.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Agriculture\n\nGrowing conditions remained favorable overall. Harvest was wrapping up for spring row crops, with production and yields generally coming in strong. Many cotton growers were expecting their best harvest in three to four years, a positive development for them and downstream industries like warehouses, ginning, and transportation. However, cotton and grain prices remain sub-profitable in many cases. A contact said government price support programs and crop insurance were important safety nets in this environment. Cattle prices stayed high, with demand remaining strong and supply continuing to be constrained by the suspension of cattle imports from Mexico in response to the spread of New World screwworm there. Agriculture outlooks are weighed down by the increased likelihood of a La Niña climate pattern this winter, which typically brings warmer, dryer weather.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas > Community Perspectives\n\nNonprofits continue to see elevated demand for a broad range of social services. Food and utility assistance remained key needs, while demand for rental and housing assistance increased. One contact noted that evictions were on the rise. Underemployment was an emerging issue. Funding remains a concern for nonprofits, and some are exploring alternate revenue streams. An agriculture nonprofit noted recording live webinars to expand its eLearning offerings and plans to charge a nominal fee for access. Likewise, a large nonprofit organization is selling high-value products on an e-commerce site, allowing it to reach more consumers than their brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit: https://www.dallasfed.org/research/texas.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Summary of Economic Activity\n\nEconomic activity in the Twelfth District edged down slightly during the mid-August to September reporting period. Employment levels were little changed on net as most employers held head counts steady. Wages grew slightly, and prices rose modestly. Activity in retail trade and residential real estate decreased somewhat while commercial real estate activity was unchanged on balance. Manufacturing and lending activity remained largely stable. Conditions in agriculture and resource-related sectors weakened slightly. Conditions in the consumer and business services sector were mixed. Conditions in community support organizations and small businesses weakened modestly. Contacts' economic outlook weakened somewhat relative to the prior reporting period.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Labor Markets\n\nEmployment levels were little changed on net over the reporting period. Most employers hired only to replace workers, holding head counts steady. Several contacts in manufacturing and health care noted reductions in staff levels through attrition, layoffs, and early retirements.
