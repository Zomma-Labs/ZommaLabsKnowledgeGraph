Slowing construction activity created scope for builders to negotiate lower prices for domestic lumber. Construction materials were largely available.\n\nCommercial real estate activity was unchanged on balance. New commercial construction remained subdued overall but was buoyed by public and private infrastructure projects, such as roads and data centers, as well as construction of health facilities. One contact reported a small increase in leasing demand from sectors such as manufacturing and logistics as more businesses opted not to further postpone decisions about space needs. Changes in rents were mixed. A Southern California contact reported that elevated vacancies pushed rents down across commercial sectors, while a contact in Utah observed that rents rose for retail space but changed little for industrial and office space.\n\n\n## Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Financial Institutions\n\nLending activity was largely steady over the reporting period. Recent reductions in interest rates started to spur additional demand for loans, but borrowers remained cautious in light of high uncertainty. Demand for commercial loans continued to be muted in general but strengthened in areas of Arizona due to large semiconductor manufacturing projects. Deposit rates were little changed, but some contacts expected reductions ahead. Credit and asset quality remained generally stable at high levels, although one contact in Utah noted an increase in losses related to fraud.\n\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit: https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/san-francisco-fed-twelfth-district-beige-book/.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CONTRACTOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Contractors are companies or individuals engaged in construction projects, responsible for managing and executing building activities.
