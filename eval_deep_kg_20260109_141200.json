      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "answer": "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\u2019s most recent Beige Book \u201cSummary of Economic Activity\u201d for the Twelfth District, covering the mid\u2011August to September reporting period, economic activity **edged down slightly**.\n\nMore specifically for that period in the Twelfth District:\n\n- **Overall activity:** \u201cEconomic activity in the Twelfth District edged down slightly during the mid-August to September reporting period.\u201d (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Summary of Economic Activity, Beige Book)\n\n- **Labor market:** \u201cEmployment levels were little changed on net as most employers held head counts steady.\u201d Wages \u201cgrew slightly,\u201d indicating modest wage gains despite flat overall employment. (Same source)\n\n- **Prices:** \u201cPrices rose modestly,\u201d meaning cost pressures increased somewhat but not sharply. (Same source)\n\n- **Key sectors:**\n  - \u201cActivity in retail trade and residential real estate decreased somewhat.\u201d\n  - \u201cCommercial real estate activity was unchanged on balance.\u201d\n  - \u201cManufacturing and lending activity remained largely stable.\u201d\n  - \u201cConditions in agriculture and resource-related sectors weakened slightly.\u201d\n  - \u201cConditions in the consumer and business services sector were mixed.\u201d\n  - \u201cConditions in community support organizations and small businesses weakened modestly.\u201d (Same source)\n\n- **Outlook:** \u201cContacts\u2019 economic outlook weakened somewhat relative to the prior reporting period.\u201d (Same source)\n\nIn summary, for the mid\u2011August to September period, the Twelfth District saw a **slight overall weakening** in economic activity: modest price and wage increases, largely flat employment, some softening in retail, housing, agriculture, small businesses, and community organizations, with manufacturing, lending, and commercial real estate mostly stable and business contacts becoming somewhat more pessimistic.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says Twelfth District (San Francisco) economic activity edged down slightly, with retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate decreasing or stable. The agent states activity edged down slightly and explicitly notes retail and residential real estate decreased and agriculture weakened slightly, matching the key facts.

      "question": "What is the Beige Book?",
      "expected": "The Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication about current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It characterizes regional economic conditions and prospects based on a variety of mostly qualitative information, gathered directly from each District's sources.",
      "answer": "The Beige Book is a report published by the Federal Reserve that provides a qualitative summary of current economic conditions across the twelve Federal Reserve Districts [Finding 1]. It compiles anecdotal information and narrative descriptions about regional economic trends\u2014such as employment, consumer spending, and business activity\u2014rather than focusing on numerical data or forecasts [Finding 1; Finding 3].\n\nAccording to the findings, it is released two weeks before each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and is used both by the FOMC and the public to understand current regional economic conditions and developments [Finding 3]. Its primary role is to serve as a key input into monetary policy discussions by highlighting qualitative aspects of the economy that may not be captured by quantitative indicators [Finding 1; Finding 3].",

      "answer": "The available findings do not identify any Federal Reserve Districts that reported no change in economic activity.

Where there is no evidence, the findings explicitly state that no conclusion can be drawn. With that constraint:\n\n1. **Spending, consumption, savings, and debt responses**\n\n- The findings on spending/consumption (Finding 2) and on savings, debt, and financial stress (Finding 3) report that **no evidence was collected**, and any potential statements would be **hypothetical and speculative**.  \n- Therefore, based on the research provided, **no factual conclusions can be made** about how lower- and middle-income households changed:\n  - their spending or consumption patterns,\n  - their savings behavior,\n  - their use of or stress related to debt.\n\n2. **Labor supply responses**\n\n- Finding 4 reports that, in response to adverse economic conditions (including wage stagnation and unemployment), **lower- and middle-income households increased reliance on multiple jobholding and gig work** to maintain:\n  - labor force participation, and  \n  - net income.  \n\n  This indicates that a documented labor-market response among these groups is to **take on additional jobs or gig work** when economic conditions weaken or wages do not keep pace.\n\n3. **Housing responses**\n\n- The same finding (Finding 4) states that lower- and middle-income households face **significant housing insecurity** under challenging economic conditions, characterized by:\n  - **rising rent burdens**,  \n  - **increased eviction rates**, and  \n  - a **greater likelihood of severe housing cost burden**.  \n\n- These housing outcomes are described as being **directly linked** to economic factors such as:\n  - **unemployment**,  \n  - **wage growth** (or its insufficiency),  \n  - **economic uncertainty**, and  \n  - **inflation**, which together erode net income and make housing costs harder to bear.\n\n**Summary based strictly on the findings provided**\n\n- **What we can say with evidence (Finding 4):**\n  - Lower- and middle-income households respond to adverse economic conditions by:\n    - Increasing **multiple jobholding and gig work** to sustain income and labor force participation.\n    - Experiencing heightened **housing insecurity**, with higher rent burdens, more evictions, and more severe housing cost burdens tied to unemployment, weak wage growth, uncertainty, and inflation.\n\n- **What the findings expressly cannot answer (Findings 1\u20133):**\n  - They do **not** provide empirical evidence on overall macroeconomic conditions since 2019, nor on:\n    - detailed **consumption/spending** adjustments,\n    - **savings** changes,\n    - **debt** accumulation or repayment,\n    - or **financial stress** measures, beyond stating that no evidence was collected.\n\nThus, within the limits of the evidence provided, the documented responses of lower- and middle-income households to economic conditions concern **labor supply (more multiple jobholding/gig work)** and **worsening housing outcomes (higher rent burden and eviction risk)**; other dimensions of response are not evidenced in the findings.",

Both global trend and comparison-to-overall-market searches explicitly report that no empirical evidence was collected, so no conclusion can be drawn on how this spending actually performed over time (Findings 1 and 2).\n\nWhat the findings do indicate is:\n\n- Higher\u2011income and ultra\u2011high\u2011net\u2011worth individuals are identified as significant drivers of demand in tourism and in luxury\u2011related sectors such as Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure and Diversified Consumer Services (Finding 3, via topics linking high\u2011income households and ultra\u2011high\u2011net\u2011worth individuals to tourism and these sectors).\n- This spending is closely connected to broader macro conditions: wage growth, net income, GDP, overall economic activity, consumer confidence, and the general economic outlook support high\u2011income luxury travel spending, while economic uncertainty and high inflation are noted as headwinds (Finding 4, based on topics connecting luxury travel demand to Consumer Spending, Wage Growth, GDP, Economic Outlook, Consumer Confidence, Economic Uncertainty, and Inflation).\n\nHowever, the findings do not specify:\n\n- How much spending by higher\u2011income individuals on luxury travel increased or decreased in any given period.\n- Whether it outperformed or underperformed the overall travel market.\n- Regional differences in performance beyond the general statement that high\u2011income segments are key drivers of global tourism demand.\n\nTherefore, based strictly on the collected evidence, the performance (in terms of measurable growth or decline) of luxury travel spending by higher\u2011income individuals cannot be determined; only its strong linkage to macroeconomic conditions and its role as a major demand driver in tourism-related sectors is supported.",

This raised the cost of production for firms that rely on imported manufacturing inputs and capital equipment.  \n   - These higher input costs were often passed through to producer prices, contributing to inflationary pressures.

(Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, chunk id: eabcf909-2aa0-44d9-82b5-5d9b4d5f6d38)  \n   - Tariffs increased prices for certain manufactured products (for example, a furniture manufacturer\u2019s products) and \u201ccontributed to sharper selling price increases in the manufacturing sector,\u201d forcing firms either to raise prices or absorb costs. (Finding 2; doc: 2026-01-08)  \n   - Some manufacturers, including at least one computer manufacturer facing steel and aluminum tariffs, reported \u201cchallenges resolving\u201d tariff\u2011related issues and, in at least one case, a firm shed workers to offset tariff\u2011related changes in its cost structure.

(Finding 3; chunk id: 2a6d2f63-8c4d-48bf-a073-54ccef582c7c)  \n   - This tariff\u2011related uncertainty weighed on demand for goods and contributed to a worsening outlook for economic activity and manufacturing, with several manufacturers attributing flat or weaker orders to tariffs and trade\u2011policy uncertainty. (Finding 3; economic uncertainty edges; Cleveland Fed chunk id: eabcf909-2aa0-44d9-82b5-5d9b4d5f6d38)  \n\nIn sum, the documented challenges manufacturers faced from tariff policies included:  \n- Increased production costs from tariffs on imported inputs and capital goods, with pass\u2011through to producer prices and inflation (Finding 1).  \n- Weaker demand and more difficult operating conditions linked directly to tariffs and retaliatory measures, including higher selling prices, cost absorption pressures, and in some cases employment adjustments (Finding 2).  \n- Heightened economic and policy uncertainty that complicated planning and investment decisions and further depressed demand for manufactured goods (Finding 3).",

Increased preference for digital, AI, and automation\u2011related skills\n   - Topics such as \u201cdigital skills demand,\u201d \u201cautomation resilience skills,\u201d \u201cAI literacy skills,\u201d and \u201cSTEM skills demand\u201d are consistently linked to \u201cLabor Market,\u201d \u201cEmployment,\u201d \u201cWage Growth,\u201d \u201cIT Services,\u201d and \u201cProfessional Services\u201d (Finding 4).\n   - This pattern supports a shift in employer preferences toward candidates with digital skills, including skills related to AI, automation, robotics, and broader STEM capabilities (Finding 4).\n   - Evidence from labor\u2011market topic graphs shows:\n     - \u201cDigital Transformation\u201d and \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d associated with \u201cLabor Market,\u201d \u201cEmployment,\u201d and \u201cIT Services\u201d (Finding 4).\n     - Employers and \u201cemployers in the district labor market\u201d increasing investment in AI technologies even while reducing employment in some areas (Finding 4: edges such as \u201cWERE_REDUCED_WHILE_EMPLOYERS_INVESTED_IN \u2192 Artificial Intelligence\u201d and \u201cCOUPLED_EMPLOYMENT_REDUCTIONS_WITH_INVESTMENT_IN \u2192 Artificial Intelligence\u201d).\n     - Specialized technical roles, especially in IT services, being the \u201cprimary category of roles lacking plentiful\u201d candidates, while applicants were plentiful overall (Finding 4; Atlanta Fed labor\u2011market excerpt).\n   - Together, these indicate a change in preferences toward candidates who possess digital and AI\u2011related technical skills, with shortages specifically in these areas.\n\n3. Greater focus on specialized technical roles, especially in IT services\n   - The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta labor\u2011market excerpt reports that \u201capplicants for open positions were plentiful except for very specific, mostly technical, roles,\u201d which were the primary category of roles lacking plentiful candidates (Finding 4, Atlanta Fed chunk).\n   - IT services are repeatedly linked to increased hiring and strong demand (\u201cHAD_HIRING_OCCURRING IN \u2192 Employment,\u201d \u201cINCREASED_HIRING_FOR \u2192 Employment,\u201d \u201cREPORTED_STRONG \u2192 Demand\u201d; Finding 4).\n   - This supports a shift in employer hiring preferences toward more specialized technical roles, particularly within IT services, even as overall hiring slowed or flattened in other areas (Finding 4).\n\n4. Change in employment mix toward part\u2011time in some contexts\n   - Topic\u2011graph evidence shows \u201cemployers in the district labor market\u201d \u201cSHIFTED_HIRING_PREFERENCE_TOWARD_PART_TIME_WORKERS_OVER_FULL_TIME\u201d and \u201cOFFERED_FEWER [full\u2011time jobs] IN FAVOR_OF_PART_TIME_WORKERS\u201d (Finding 4, edges under \u201cEmployment\u201d).\n   - This indicates that, at least in the referenced district labor market, employer preferences shifted away from full\u2011time roles toward part\u2011time positions. The findings do not specify industries, reasons, or exact timing.\n\n5. AI\u2011related restructuring of what kinds of roles are preferred\n   - Evidence links AI adoption to workforce reduction (\u201cWERE_ASSOCIATED_WITH_AI_CAPABILITIES_REDUCING \u2192 Labor Market\u201d; \u201cWERE_REDUCED_WHILE_EMPLOYERS_INVESTED_IN \u2192 Artificial Intelligence\u201d; Finding 4).\n   - A Minnesota advertising firm \u201cEXPECTED_REDUCED_NEED_FOR [employment] DUE_TO_AI_TOOLS,\u201d with AI tools \u201cSAID_TO_PERFORM_WORK_FASTER_THAN\u201d workers (Finding 4, edges under \u201cEmployment\u201d).\n   - At the same time, firms \u201cEXPECT_FURTHER_INCREASES IN [workforce reductions] BASED_ON_EARLY_GENERATIVE [AI]\u201d but are also increasing AI\u2011related investment and hiring within IT services (Finding 4).\n   - This points to a changing preference: fewer hires for roles that can be substituted by AI tools and more demand for roles that build, manage, or complement AI and digital systems. The findings do not quantify the shift.\n\n6. What the findings do *not* show\n   - For soft skills, remote\u2011work capabilities, culture/values fit, and broader changes in candidate attributes (e.g., growth mindset), the findings state explicitly that no evidence was collected and no definitive conclusions can be drawn (Finding 3).\n   - For a comprehensive, long\u2011run global or US\u2011wide picture of how employer preferences changed over the last 10\u201315 years, the findings explicitly report that no definitive conclusions can be drawn due to lack of evidence (Finding 1).\n\nIn summary, based on the available evidence, the documented changes in employers\u2019 hiring preferences are:\n- a move, especially in professional services and IT, from degree\u2011centric screening toward skills\u2011based hiring (Finding 2);\n- increased preference for candidates with digital, AI, automation, and STEM\u2011related technical skills (Finding 4);\n- greater emphasis on filling specialized technical roles, particularly in IT services, where candidates are scarce (Finding 4);\n- in at least one district labor market, a shift in preference from full\u2011time toward part\u2011time positions (Finding 4);\nwhile other possible shifts (soft skills, remote\u2011work skills, culture fit, diversity emphasis) are not supported by the collected evidence.",

      "answer": "Labor cost pressures intensified primarily because of three related forces documented in the findings:\n\n1. **Robust wage growth in a tight labor market**  \n   - Recent U.S. labor cost pressures are \u201cprimarily driven by robust wage growth, fueled by a tight labor market\u201d with low unemployment and high demand for workers, which forces employers to raise pay to attract and retain employees [Finding 1].  \n   - Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland contacts in **banking** and **professional and business services** specifically reported that they \u201chad raised wages because of persistent competition in the labor market\u201d [Finding 2]. This persistent competition is identified as a primary driver of elevated labor cost pressures.\n\n2. **Broader inflation enabling firms to pass higher labor costs into prices**  \n   - The intensified labor cost pressures are \u201cexacerbated by broader inflationary pressures that enable businesses to pass on these increased labor expenses through pricing power\u201d [Finding 1].  \n   - Because firms can raise prices, higher labor costs are more sustainable, which supports continued wage increases and thus further intensifies labor cost pressures [Finding 1].\n\n3. **Structural constraints on labor supply and participation**  \n   - Structural factors \u201csignificantly affecting labor supply and participation, thereby contributing to increased labor costs\u201d include:\n     * **Demographic trends and retirements**, which reduce available workers [Finding 3].  \n     * **Immigration policies**, which are reported as influencing the labor market and contributing to labor market conditions [Finding 3].  \n     * **Skills mismatches**, listed as a structural factor related to labor supply and participation [Finding 3].  \n     * Shifts in work arrangements (e.g., firms both expanding and reducing remote work) and a \u201cstrained\u201d labor market in multiple Federal Reserve districts, with workforce reduction and declines reported by contacts, indicating tighter supply and higher costs to secure and retain labor [Finding 3].\n\nIn combination, these factors\u2014tight and competitive labor markets driving strong wage growth, an inflationary environment that allows firms to pass on higher labor costs through pricing power, and structural constraints on labor supply and participation\u2014are identified in the findings as the main drivers of the intensification of labor cost pressures in the recent U.S. economy.",

      "expected": "Commercial construction and financial services contacts noted an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates. Some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates.",
      "answer": "Lower interest rates affected business activity through several, partly offsetting channels identified in the findings:\n\n1. **Main positive transmission: better bank lending conditions**\n   - Lower interest rates **improved bank lending**, as indicated by links such as \u201cIMPROVED_AS_A_RESULT_OF_LOWER \u2192 Interest Rates\u201d and \u201cIMPROVED_DUE_TO \u2192 Interest Rates\u201d for Bank Lending (Finding 1).\n   - This **bank lending channel** is identified as the primary way lower policy rates supported **business investment and activity**, by easing credit conditions for firms (Finding 1).\n\n2. **Cost of capital and investment decisions**\n   - Research on \u201cmonetary policy transmission to business investment\u201d and \u201cuser cost of capital\u201d indicates that lower interest rates reduce the **user cost of capital**, making borrowing cheaper and thereby **indirectly encouraging investment** (Finding 1).\n   - However, survey-based evidence notes that **economic uncertainty and lack of clarity about the outlook** were \u201cputting a damper\u201d on business investment and that firms were \u201cunwilling to make\u201d investments despite conditions (Finding 1). This shows lower rates alone did not guarantee higher investment.\n\n3. **Balance-sheet effects and leverage**\n   - Low interest rates **increased corporate leverage**, as firms took on more debt under cheaper financing conditions (Finding 3).\n   - They also contributed to the **rise of \u201czombie firms\u201d**\u2014financially weak firms able to survive via cheap refinancing rather than productive performance (Finding 3).\n   - This environment can **depress overall business investment**, as capital and credit are tied up in low-productivity firms and financial engineering rather than new, productive projects (Finding 3).\n\n4. **Asset prices and sectoral impacts**\n   - Low rates encouraged a **\u201csearch for yield,\u201d** pushing investors into riskier assets and contributing to **asset price inflation**, particularly in real estate (Finding 3).\n   - Sectors tied closely to financing costs\u2014such as **housing and real estate (Residential REITs, Commercial Real Estate, Specialized REITs)**\u2014showed a **strong positive correlation with low interest rates**, benefiting from cheaper borrowing and increased investment flows (Finding 3).\n   - In contrast, the impact on **broad non\u2011financial business investment** is described as **\u201cless consistently positive,\u201d** reflecting that lower rates did not reliably translate into strong investment in productive capacity across all sectors (Finding 3).\n\n5. **Limits: when low rates fail to stimulate activity**\n   - At very low levels, interest rate cuts can enter a **liquidity trap**, where \u201cfurther reductions may not incentivize additional borrowing and investment\u201d (Finding 4).\n   - In such environments, or when there is **significant economic uncertainty and weak demand**, business confidence and investment remain **subdued despite ample liquidity and low borrowing costs** (Finding 4).\n   - The findings emphasize that **economic uncertainty and weak demand** can dominate, making monetary easing \u201cineffective in stimulating business activity\u201d even when rates are very low (Finding 4).\n\n6. **Overall synthesis**\n   - According to the findings, **lower interest rates generally supported business activity by improving bank lending conditions and reducing the cost of capital**, which are favorable to investment (Finding 1).\n   - At the same time, **they increased leverage, helped sustain zombie firms, and fueled asset price inflation**, particularly in real estate, with **ambiguous or subdued effects on productive business investment** in the aggregate (Finding 3).\n   - Their effectiveness was **materially constrained** in contexts of **liquidity traps and high economic uncertainty**, where low rates did **not** translate into strong gains in business activity (Finding 4).\n\nThe findings do not provide quantified empirical estimates of these effects for specific countries or periods; they only describe the mechanisms and qualitative impacts summarized above.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is specific: lower interest rates led to an uptick in demand noted by commercial construction and financial services contacts, and some reports cited improved business lending in recent weeks.

In Atlanta, overall demand for agricultural products was healthy. Minneapolis agricultural contacts were concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases.",
      "answer": "Recent conditions in the agriculture sector were mixed, with several sources of strain alongside some areas of relative strength.\n\n1. **Overall financial and credit conditions**\n   * Agricultural conditions had weakened relative to the previous period, with a higher share of reports indicating **declines in farm conditions and bank lending** to agriculture. This included **declines reported by lenders in crop\u2011heavy areas and in areas with more cattle production**, and an overall **higher share reporting declines in farm lending** (Finding 1).\n   * At the same time, **credit conditions within agriculture were described as strong and considerably stronger for cattle producers**, and economic conditions were noted as **considerably stronger for cattle producers** compared with other segments (Finding 1).\n\n2. **Prices, costs, and profitability**\n   * Producers faced a **strained cost structure**: **higher input costs, especially energy and other commodities, were raising breakeven levels**, contributing to a **strain and deterioration of agriculture\u2019s cost structure** (Finding 2).\n   * **Elevated expenses combined with low crop prices were weighing down producer incomes.** Agricultural commodities in several key crops had **declining prices** (e.g., soybeans, wheat, pulse crops, hay, milk, chickens), while some others (e.g., sunflowers, cattle, hogs) had increased (Finding 2).\n   * For many agricultural commodities, prices **remained sub\u2011profitable**, were **below levels needed for net income**, and were **sub\u2011profitable for producers**, meaning revenues often did not cover the heightened cost base (Finding 2).\n   * Climate\u2011related oversupply in some regions contributed: in one Federal Reserve District, **corn production was expected to set record levels and soybean harvests were very strong, but low crop prices and elevated expenses still weakened agricultural conditions and reduced producer incomes** (Finding 2).\n\n3. **Policy, trade, and macro shocks**\n   * **Fiscal policy was expected to be a critical lifeline for agriculture and farmers**, and was explicitly described as such by contacts; it was viewed as essential support under current strained conditions (Finding 3).\n   * **Trade policy and export developments added pressure.** Contacts were \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about **China\u2019s decision not to order soybeans from U.S. producers**, and the **trade balance was reported as constrained by suspension of agricultural exports**, with certain agricultural activities **suspended due to their spread**, weighing on trade (Findings 2 and 3).\n\n4. **Climate and weather risks**\n   * **Climate risk was a direct cause of financial strain in agriculture**, with reports that it **particularly affected crop quality** and **resulted in lower\u2011quality agricultural output** (Finding 3).\n   * The **increased likelihood of a La Ni\u00f1a climate pattern weighed down agricultural prospects**, and climate risk was cited as **a key reason for the 2025 outlook for agriculture**, contributing to poor agricultural outcomes and reduced crop quality (Finding 3).\n\n5. **Labor market conditions**\n   * The **labor market in agriculture was reported as strained in several districts**. Agriculture\u2019s labor market was **reduced** and **reported as strained in recent weeks** (Finding 3).\n   * **Changes in immigration policy and enforcement had impacts concentrated in agriculture**, contributing to **difficulties in securing labor** and causing **shortages**. These changes reportedly **made it difficult to obtain sufficient workers**, with contacts in agriculture reporting issues such as workers not reporting to jobs (Finding 3).\n   * Labor shortages in agriculture **caused increases in cost structure**, adding to already elevated input costs (Finding 3).\n\n6. **Energy prices and input costs**\n   * **Rising energy prices** were a notable driver of cost pressures. Higher energy prices were **raising the agricultural cost structure**, identified as a particularly important input category that **contributed to strain and deterioration in agriculture** (Findings 2 and 3).\n   * Contacts reported that **higher input costs were raising breakeven prices**, and energy\u2011linked cost increases fed into broader inflation and cost pressures, further straining producer margins (Findings 2 and 3).\n\n7. **Summary of sector conditions**\n   * Overall, the agriculture sector was in a **weakened and financially strained condition**:\n     * **Weakened agricultural conditions** and **higher shares of lenders reporting declines in farm lending**.\n     * **Producer incomes under pressure** from the combination of **low or sub\u2011profitable commodity prices** and **elevated input costs**, especially energy and other commodities.\n     * **Climate risks and La Ni\u00f1a\u2011related concerns** reducing crop quality and weighing on the outlook.\n     * **Labor shortages linked to immigration policy changes** raising costs and constraining operations.\n     * **Trade disruptions and export suspensions** (including China\u2019s pullback from U.S. soybeans) adding further uncertainty.\n   * Against this backdrop, **credit conditions and economic performance were relatively stronger for cattle producers** than for crop producers, and **fiscal policy support was viewed as a critical lifeline for the sector** (Findings 1\u20133).",

More specifically, wage pressures **\u201cpersisted for highly specialized positions,\u201d** while general \u201cWage Growth\u201d is noted as something that **\u201cpersisted\u201d** in this context (Finding 3). This indicates that employment decisions under AI adoption maintained or increased wage pressure for highly specialized roles, even as other positions were reduced.\n\n3. **Bias, discrimination, and fairness in automated employment decisions**  \n   - AI\u2011based hiring tools are found to have the **potential to introduce or perpetuate bias and discrimination** in employment decisions, and **algorithmic bias is identified as a significant concern** in automated decision systems used for hiring (Finding 2).  \n   - Topics like \u201cemployment discrimination artificial intelligence\u201d appear directly in the evidence, indicating that AI\u2011driven tools are specifically implicated in discriminatory employment decisions (Finding 2).  \n   - The appearance of \u201cEEOC AI hiring guidance\u201d alongside \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d and \u201cEmployment\u201d shows that regulators are actively addressing AI\u2019s role in potentially discriminatory employment practices, which in turn shapes how organizations make and govern employment decisions when they use AI (Finding 2).\n\nIn sum, the findings indicate that artificial intelligence has affected employment decisions by:\n- Enabling employers to reduce headcount\u2014especially in less experienced roles\u2014while substituting some human tasks with AI and increasing investment in AI technologies (Finding 1; Finding 3).  \n- Shifting decisions toward greater operational efficiency and contributing to differentiated wage dynamics, with sustained wage pressures for highly specialized positions (Findings 1 and 3).  \n- Introducing significant concerns about bias, discrimination, and fairness in automated hiring and employment decisions, prompting regulatory attention (Finding 2).",

      "answer": "Consumer spending patterns differed sharply by income group, and the divergence centered on who was able to maintain or expand spending versus who had to cut back.\n\n1. **How spending patterns differed by income group**\n\n- **Low- and moderate-income households**\n  - These households **reduced their spending**, including on necessities. This reduction is explicitly associated with low- and moderate-income groups.  \n  - Their ability to spend was **partially supported by programs like SNAP**, indicating that some basic consumption was being maintained through external support rather than income alone.  \n  - Overall, they were more exposed to spending cuts, particularly in non-essential categories.\n\n- **Middle-income consumers**\n  - Middle-income consumers are described as **\u201cincreasingly cautious\u201d even as they maintain their spending**.  \n  - They were trying to **sustain existing spending levels** rather than expand them, suggesting more defensive behavior than higher-income groups but less contraction than low-income households.\n\n- **Mid- to upper-income households**\n  - These households **helped support overall economic activity** through their spending.  \n  - They **shifted their spending between goods and services**, rather than cutting back overall, and continued to spend in **discretionary categories such as travel, events, and luxury services**.  \n  - They **continued to contribute to consumer spending through travel**, and **continued to spend on travel and events**, demonstrating resilience in leisure and experience-based categories.\n\n2. **What drove those differences**\n\n- **Support and ability to maintain spending**\n  - For **mid- to upper-income households**, spending was explicitly described as **\u201chelped support\u201d** and **\u201cpartially supported\u201d** (doc: 2026-01-08). This indicates that these groups benefited from conditions or support that enabled them to **maintain or reallocate** spending rather than reduce it.\n  - **Consumer spending overall was \u201cbuoyed\u201d** and **\u201csupported through spending\u201d** by these higher-income groups, reinforcing that their financial position allowed continued discretionary consumption.\n\n- **Constraints on lower-income households**\n  - **Low- and moderate-income households are directly linked to \u201creduced\u201d spending**. The findings do not specify detailed mechanisms (such as specific price or wage effects), but the contrast with mid- to upper-income groups indicates **tighter constraints on their ability to maintain spending**, even on necessities.\n  - The fact that **SNAP cuts were seen as posing additional risks to consumer spending** and that low-income households\u2019 spending was **partially supported by SNAP** underscores that their consumption depended more on transfer programs and was therefore more vulnerable to policy or income shocks.\n\n- **Behavioral stance by income group**\n  - **Middle-income consumers** being **\u201cincreasingly cautious even as they maintain their spending\u201d** suggests that expectations and perceived risk were an important driver for this group: they did not yet cut back as sharply as low-income households but were not as able or willing to expand discretionary spending as higher-income households.\n  - **Mid- to upper-income households\u2019 continued spending on travel, events, and luxury services** indicates that their higher and more stable resources, combined with fewer binding constraints, allowed them to keep prioritizing discretionary and experiential categories.\n\nIn sum, the research indicates that **lower-income households cut back spending (even on basics) and relied more on support programs**, **middle-income households became cautious but tried to hold spending steady**, and **mid- to upper-income households maintained and shifted spending, especially toward discretionary services and experiences**. These differences were driven primarily by **differences in support and capacity to maintain spending**, with higher-income groups\u2019 spending explicitly described as \u201chelped\u201d and \u201cpartially supported,\u201d while lower-income groups were characterized by spending reductions.",

      "expected": "In the Minneapolis District, agricultural contacts were specifically concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases, representing a direct trade policy impact. In the St. Louis District, agriculture conditions were strained and further deteriorated, with the overall pessimistic outlook. Across reporting districts, activity in agriculture was generally down, with trade uncertainty adding to sector challenges.",
      "answer": "Trade-related concerns weakened agricultural conditions in several Federal Reserve Districts, mainly through export and commodity-market channels, with notable variation across districts.\n\nAccording to a 2026-01-08 source, agricultural contacts were concerned about the elimination of export markets, explicitly linked to China, indicating that trade tensions with China were a key issue for agriculture [2026-01-08 document, via \u201cAgricultural Contacts \u2026 were concerned about the elimination of export markets \u2026 China\u201d]. These concerns centered on the loss of existing overseas markets rather than just short-term price fluctuations.\n\nAcross districts, exports were reported as strong in some areas, yet overall commodity markets were lower [2026-01-08 document: \u201cExports \u2026 were strong in some districts, but overall commodities were lower\u201d]. This suggests that even where export volumes held up, prices or broader commodity conditions were unfavorable, reflecting the drag from trade tensions.\n\nSpecific district-level impacts mentioned include:\n\n- **St. Louis District:** The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported \u201cstrained and further deteriorated\u201d agricultural conditions in its district, with this deterioration tied to trade tensions affecting commodity markets and exports [explore_neighbors result: \u201creports strained and further deteriorated conditions in \u2190 Federal Reserve Bank Of St. Louis\u201d linked to Agriculture and trade tensions].\n\n- **Chicago District:** The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago also reported strained conditions for agriculture, again in the context of trade tensions [explore_neighbors: \u201creported conditions for \u2190 Federal Reserve Bank Of Chicago\u201d connected to Agriculture and trade-related issues].\n\nCommodity-specific effects were highlighted for soybeans: market conditions for soybeans were described as \u201cdepressed\u201d in at least one district [2026-01-08 document: \u201chad market conditions described as depressed within \u2190 Soybean\u201d], consistent with the broader narrative of weakened agricultural markets due to trade tensions.\n\nIn contrast, some districts\u2014referenced through the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis (Ninth District) and \u201cDistrict States\u201d\u2014saw very strong exports [explore_neighbors: \u201cwere very strong in \u2192 federal reserve bank of minneapolis district (ninth district)\u201d and \u201c\u2192 District States\u201d for Exports]. However, even in those areas, this strength in exports coexisted with generally lower commodity markets, indicating that trade-related uncertainty and price pressures were still present at the sector level.\n\nIn sum, the findings indicate that trade-related concerns\u2014especially tensions with China and fears of losing export markets\u2014contributed to:\n\n- Strained and in some cases further deteriorating agricultural conditions in districts such as St. Louis and Chicago;\n- Depressed conditions in key traded commodities like soybeans;\n- A pattern where some districts maintained strong export volumes, but still faced lower commodity market conditions overall.\n\nBeyond these points, the findings do not provide additional district-by-district detail or quantify the magnitude of impacts.",

      "expected": "In the New York District, nonprofits faced challenges due to unpredictable funding and reduction in federal benefit programs, with a community health-care center reporting financial distress among Medicaid patients. In the Cleveland District, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to uncertainty around federal grants. In the Boston District, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in the education and health-care sectors.",
      "answer": "Federal policy changes affected nonprofits across multiple Federal Reserve Districts through three main channels identified in the findings: (1) federal relief programs and broader fiscal policy uncertainty, (2) tax and regulatory changes affecting nonprofit finances, and (3) shifts in federal grants and contracting. The documented effects are primarily on revenue, budgets, and social-service capacity, with evidence drawn from several Federal Reserve district publications and topic linkages.\n\n### 1. Effects linked to federal relief and broader fiscal/monetary policy\n\n- Research connecting \u201cfederal policy and nonprofit sector\u201d shows that **fiscal and monetary policy** changes are directly tied to areas relevant to nonprofits such as **social services, campaign finance, lobbying, revenue, and wage growth** ([Finding 1](resolve_topic{'query': 'federal policy and nonprofit sector'})).\n- Federal Reserve research on **community development and nonprofits** indicates that **Federal Reserve actions (monetary policy, including quantitative tightening) interact with nonprofits**\u2014especially community development nonprofits\u2014through **financial channels like bank lending and real estate** ([Finding 1](resolve_topic{'query': 'Federal Reserve community development nonprofits'})).\n- This means that, across districts, nonprofits operating in community development and social services are affected by federal monetary policy indirectly via **credit conditions, bank lending, and real estate markets** (Federal Reserve community development\u2013nonprofits linkage in multiple districts; [Finding 1](resolve_topic{'query': 'Federal Reserve community development nonprofits'})).\n\n### 2. District-level evidence on federal relief programs and nonprofit conditions\n\nFederal Reserve Banks in many districts (Atlanta, Cleveland, Philadelphia, San Francisco, New York, Minneapolis, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas) have **systematically documented how federal policies such as the CARES Act, American Rescue Plan, and Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) intersect with nonprofit conditions**:\n\n- These Banks publish **community development and \u201cCommunity Perspectives\u201d reports** that explicitly include **nonprofit organizations** as subjects or respondents ([Finding 2](resolve_entity queries)).\n- The findings indicate that **nonprofits and philanthropic organizations are incorporated as contacts, respondents, or focus groups** in these reports across districts including:\n  - **Atlanta, Cleveland, Philadelphia, San Francisco, New York, Minneapolis, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas** ([Finding 2](resolve_entity queries)).\n- These reports are explicitly tied to **federal relief programs (CARES Act, American Rescue Plan, PPP)** ([Finding 2](resolve_entity and explore_neighbors queries)), meaning that:\n  - Across these districts, **nonprofits\u2019 experiences, challenges, and adjustments during and after these federal policy interventions are being recorded as part of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monitoring of community conditions**.\n- The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in particular **uses a \u201cCommunity Perspectives\u201d section specifically to discuss conditions affecting nonprofits** ([Finding 2](explore_neighbors{'entity_name': 'Federal Reserve Bank Of Dallas'})), indicating that:\n  - In the Dallas District, **nonprofits\u2019 responses to federal policy and macroeconomic conditions are explicitly tracked and qualitatively described**.\n\nWhile the summarized evidence does not quote specific numeric outcomes for each district, it establishes that **across at least 9 Federal Reserve Districts, nonprofit conditions under federal policies like CARES/ARP/PPP are being systematically reported and discussed**, with a focus on **community development and financial stress channels**.\n\n### 3. Tax and regulatory policy impacts on nonprofit finances and services (with geographic variation)\n\nTopic linkages around **federal tax policy and nonprofits** and **nonprofits and taxation** show the following:\n\n- **Federal tax and regulatory changes** are tied to:\n  - **Revenue and Net Income** of nonprofits ([Finding 3](resolve_topic{'query': 'federal tax policy and nonprofits'}); [Finding 3](resolve_topic{'query': 'nonprofits and taxation'})).\n  - **Social Services** as a major area affected ([Finding 3](resolve_topic queries)).\n- This means that when **tax laws or related regulations change at the federal level**, the findings associate those changes with:\n  - **Shifts in nonprofits\u2019 revenue and net income**, which directly affect their **operational capacity**.\n  - **Downstream effects on the scale and delivery of social services** ([Finding 3](resolve_topic{'query': 'federal tax policy and nonprofits'}); [Finding 3](resolve_topic{'query': 'nonprofits and taxation'})).\n- The findings state that **the nature and magnitude of these effects are likely to vary geographically** due to differing regional economic and political contexts ([Finding 3 Result section]). While no district-level breakdown is given, the conclusion is that:\n  - **Different Federal Reserve Districts likely see different nonprofit impacts from the same federal tax/regulatory change**, because local conditions mediate those effects ([Finding 3]).\n\n### 4. Federal grants and contracting: uncertainty, anticipated reductions, and social service strain\n\nFederal grants and contracts are another channel where federal policy changes affect nonprofits across districts:\n\n- Topic explorations around **federal grants to nonprofits** and **nonprofit funding regional distribution** show that:\n  - **Social services** and nonprofits rely on **federal grants and related funding** ([Finding 4](resolve_topic{'query': 'federal grants to nonprofits'}); [Finding 4](resolve_topic{'query': 'nonprofit funding regional distribution'})).\n- The evidence tied to **Fiscal Policy** and **Revenue** provides specific qualitative effects:\n\n  - From the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\u2019s **Community Conditions** section (community, nonprofit, and other nonbusiness contacts) ([Finding 4], Chicago chunk):\n    - **\u201cIn planning for 2026, many nonprofit organizations anticipated the need to find new funding streams and adapt to smaller budgets.\u201d**\n    - **Social service contacts reported that increased operating costs (e.g., insurance), combined with reduced income and donations, were forcing them to carefully prioritize which services to provide.**\n    - This links **fiscal policy\u2013related uncertainty** and funding expectations to:\n      - Anticipated **smaller budgets**,\n      - A push to **find new funding streams**, and\n      - **Triage of services** due to cost pressures and reduced revenue.\n\n  - More generally, the Fiscal Policy topic shows:\n    - **\u201cFiscal policy created uncertainty for the nonprofit sector, leading to unfilled positions and affecting hiring.\u201d** ([Finding 4](explore_neighbors{'entity_name': 'Fiscal Policy'})).\n    - **Nonprofit organizations anticipated reductions in federal support and the need to adapt to smaller budgets** ([Finding 4](explore_neighbors{'entity_name': 'Fiscal Policy'}), \u201cANTICIPATED_REDUCTION_IN nonprofit organizations | Planning for 2026\u201d).\n    - **Community support organizations\u2019 capacity to provide assistance was limited by fiscal policy\u2013related constraints** ([Finding 4](explore_neighbors{'entity_name': 'Fiscal Policy'}), links to Community Support Organizations).\n\n  - On the revenue side:\n    - **Nonprofits remained concerned about revenue**, with revenue \u201cremaining a concern\u201d for nonprofits and being \u201creduced for organizations\u201d ([Finding 4](explore_neighbors{'entity_name': 'Revenue'})).\n    - **Social service contacts reported reductions in revenue**, indicating financial pressure on service providers ([Finding 4](explore_neighbors{'entity_name': 'Revenue'}), \u201cREPORTED_REDUCTIONS_IN Social Service Contacts\u201d).\n    - The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City reported a **decline in revenue** in its district ([Finding 4](explore_neighbors{'entity_name': 'Revenue'}), \u201cREPORTED_DECLINE_IN federal reserve bank of kansas city\u201d).\n\n- The Social Services topic confirms that, across the system:\n  - **Nonprofit social service providers are facing challenges due to reductions in funding and unpredictable funding streams** ([Finding 4](explore_neighbors{'entity_name': 'Social Services'})).\n  - **They also face elevated demand for services**, as social services \u201cexperienced elevated demand for\u201d or \u201csee elevated demand for\u201d assistance from nonprofits and nonprofit organizations ([Finding 4](explore_neighbors{'entity_name': 'Social Services'})).\n  - The Federal Reserve System **conducts recurring surveys** that document these conditions for social-services nonprofits across districts ([Finding 4](explore_neighbors{'entity_name': 'Social Services'})).\n\nTaken together, this evidence indicates that **federal fiscal decisions regarding grants and contracts are creating uncertainty and expected reductions in funding that are pushing nonprofits\u2014especially social service organizations\u2014to cut back, prioritize, or restructure services**, and this is documented in at least the **Chicago and Kansas City** districts, with **system-wide survey evidence** pointing to similar concerns elsewhere.\n\n### 5. Sector-specific federal funding cuts and regional labor impacts\n\n- The link between **Fiscal Policy** and **Health Care Providers & Services** shows that:\n  - When **fiscal policy\u2013related cuts** occurred, they **contributed to layoffs in health care providers and diversified consumer services** ([Finding 4](explore_neighbors{'entity_name': 'Health Care Providers & Services'})).\n  - Health care providers expressed concern that **grant funding may not arrive**, suggesting that policy-driven grant uncertainty is affecting staffing and operations in health-related nonprofits or quasi-nonprofit entities ([Finding 4](explore_neighbors{'entity_name': 'Health Care Providers & Services'})).\n- These findings imply that, in districts where health-care and related service nonprofits are prominent, **federal policy changes to grant programs and health-related funding translate into staffing cuts and financial distress at the organizational level**.\n\n### 6. Overall cross-district pattern\n\nBased strictly on the findings:\n\n- **Across many Federal Reserve Districts (Atlanta, Cleveland, Philadelphia, San Francisco, New York, Minneapolis, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas)**, the Federal Reserve\u2019s own reports and \u201cCommunity Perspectives\u201d sections show that **nonprofits are being used as key informants and subjects** in monitoring community and economic conditions, especially around federal policy episodes such as **CARES Act, American Rescue Plan, and PPP** ([Finding 2]).\n- **Federal fiscal and tax policies** influence nonprofits primarily through:\n  - **Revenue and net income** changes,\n  - **Grant and contract volatility**,\n  - **Uncertainty that hampers hiring and planning**, and\n  - **Increased operating cost pressures** ([Findings 3 and 4]).\n- These effects are particularly acute for **social services and community support organizations**, which face:\n  - **Reduced or unpredictable federal funding**,\n  - **Elevated demand for services**, and\n  - The need to **prioritize or cut services** under tighter budgets ([Finding 4], including the Chicago district chunk and Social Services topic edges).\n- While the findings state that the **magnitude and nature of impacts likely vary geographically**, they do not provide a district-by-district quantitative comparison. Instead, they document:\n  - Specific qualitative evidence from **Chicago and Kansas City**, and\n  - System-wide evidence that **social service nonprofits across multiple districts are under simultaneous funding pressure and elevated demand**, shaped by recent and anticipated federal policy changes ([Findings 2, 3, and 4]).\n\nIn sum, the research shows that federal policy changes\u2014through relief programs, fiscal and tax decisions, and grant/contract dynamics\u2014have **reduced or threatened nonprofit revenues, increased uncertainty, and constrained staffing and service capacity**, especially in social services, across multiple Federal Reserve Districts, with these conditions documented most explicitly in Federal Reserve district\u2013level \u201cCommunity Perspectives\u201d and community conditions reports.",

That adjustment changed how wage growth translated into aggregate labor costs: per\u2011worker costs rose, but total labor costs were partly offset via fewer workers.\n\nIn summary, the findings show that labor costs were shaped by:  \n- Wage growth under labor\u2011market supply\u2013demand pressures;  \n- Non\u2011wage cost components (especially employer\u2011sponsored health insurance and other healthcare\u2011related costs, plus taxes and regulation) that intensified cost structures and influenced wage\u2011setting;  \n- Firms\u2019 pricing power and exposure to tariffs; and  \n- Sector\u2011specific labor\u2011market tightness and labor relations.\n\nThese factors interacted such that rising non\u2011wage costs and tight labor markets tended to **intensify wage growth and overall labor costs**, while periods of easing labor\u2011market conditions, cost\u2011management strategies (like hiring at minimum wage or workforce reductions), and limits on pricing power **constrained further wage increases and moderated labor\u2011cost growth**.",

      "answer": "Lower interest rates affected interest rate\u2011sensitive sectors in notably different ways across Federal Reserve Districts, with generally mixed and often muted overall effects.\n\n**1. Housing and real estate**\n\n- The housing market is a key interest rate\u2011sensitive sector (including residential and mortgage REITs), with transmission operating through borrowing costs and investment decisions (Finding 1).  \n- Despite lower interest rates, housing activity \u201cremained muted\u201d in some districts (Finding 3: \u201cHAD_MUTED_ACTIVITY_DESPITE_LOWER \u2192 Interest Rates\u201d and \u201cREMAINED_MUTED_IN \u2192 District\u201d).  \n- In the Dallas District, credit conditions for real estate improved: contacts reported a slight easing for residential real estate loans and a sharp improvement in loan performance for commercial real estate (Finding 4: Dallas \u201cREPORTED_EASING_SLIGHTLY_FOR_RESIDENTIAL_REAL_ESTATE_LOANS\u201d and \u201cSHARPLY_IMPROVED_FOR \u2192 Commercial Real Estate Loans\u201d).  \n- In the Kansas City District, credit conditions were stable overall, but commercial real estate activity declined even as conditions \u201cremained near historical norm\u201d (Finding 4: \u201cWAS_STABLE_IN \u2190 Credit Conditions\u201d; CRE \u201cDECLINED_IN\u201d and \u201cEXPERIENCED_DECLINES_IN_NEW_PROPERTY_DEVELOPMENT_ASPECTS\u201d).  \n- The St. Louis District reported strong overall credit conditions but noted a negative impact on the housing market (Finding 4: St. Louis \u201cREPORTED_NEGATIVE_IMPACT_ON \u2192 Housing Market\u201d while credit conditions \u201cREPORTED_REMAINED_STRONG\u201d).  \n\n**Pattern:** Lower rates did not uniformly translate into stronger housing activity; some districts (e.g., Dallas) saw better loan performance and some easing, while others reported muted or negatively affected housing activity despite strong or stable credit conditions.\n\n---\n\n**2.

Automobiles**\n\n- Automobiles are identified as an interest rate\u2011sensitive area via the loan/credit channel (Finding 3: topics linking auto loans, vehicle sales, and interest rates).  \n- In some Federal Reserve districts, auto sales \u201cwere boosted\u201d and \u201cincreased in some federal reserve districts,\u201d with strong demand for electric vehicles specifically cited as the driver (Finding 3: \u201cWERE_BOOSTED_IN_SOME \u2192 Districts\u201d and \u201cWERE_BOOSTED_BY_STRONG_DEMAND_FOR \u2192 electric vehicles\u201d).  \n- The Chicago District reported brisk auto sales in some areas, attributing them to strong EV demand, while also noting softer demand at dealerships in low\u2011 to moderate\u2011income communities and flat\u2011to\u2011down conditions reported by some auto dealers (Finding 3: Chicago \u201cIDENTIFIED_STRONG_UNDERLYING_DEMAND\u201d and \u201cREPORTED_BRISK_SALES,\u201d but also \u201cREPORTED_SOFTER_DEMAND\u201d and \u201cREPORTED_AS_BEING_FLAT_TO_DOWN\u201d).  \n\n**Pattern:** Lower rates coincided with stronger auto activity in some districts, especially where EV demand was high, but response was uneven even within a district, with weaker conditions in lower\u2011income areas.\n\n---\n\n**4. Financial services, consumer spending, and loan demand**\n\n- Financial services contacts explicitly attributed increased demand to lower interest rates (Finding 2: \u201cATTRIBUTED_INCREASED_DEMAND_TO_LOWER \u2190 Financial Services Contacts\u201d).  \n- Lower interest rates were also cited as contributing to higher consumer spending (Finding 2: \u201cINFLUENCED_BY_BEING_LOWER_CONTRIBUTING_TO_HIGHER_DEMAND \u2192 Consumer Spending\u201d).  \n- At the same time, overall sector activity, including financial services, was described as \u201cmixed\u201d and \u201cmuted\u201d (Finding 2: \u201cSHOWED_MUTED_ACTIVITY_EVEN_AS \u2192 Interest Rates\u201d and \u201cFinancial Services \u2026 HAD_MIXED_ACTIVITY\u201d).  \n- Across districts, credit conditions and bank lending show variation:\n  - Dallas: easing of credit conditions and improved loan performance, especially in CRE, alongside some tightening in non\u2011residential loan types (Finding 4: Dallas \u201cREPORTED_EASING_OF \u2192 Credit Conditions,\u201d \u201cREPORTED_TIGHTENING_OF\u201d for some loans).  \n  - Kansas City: credit conditions and loan demand remained stable, while CRE and some real estate\u2013related activities declined (Finding 4).  \n  - St. Louis: credit conditions remained strong overall, loan demand was moderate, but agriculture deteriorated (Finding 4: \u201cWERE_DESCRIBED_AS_STRONG IN \u2026 St. Louis\u201d and \u201cREPORTED_DETERIORATION_OF \u2192 Agriculture\u201d).  \n\n**Pattern:** Lower rates supported demand for financial services and consumer borrowing in some districts, but the overall response in financial and credit markets remained uneven, with sector\u2011 and district\u2011specific pockets of strength and softness.\n\n---\n\n**5. Agriculture**\n\n- Agriculture is identified as a sector tied to credit conditions and thus linked to interest rate movements (Finding 4: topic \u201cagricultural credit conditions\u201d).  \n- In the St. Louis District, agricultural conditions were reported as \u201cstrained and deteriorated,\u201d despite strong overall credit conditions in the district (Finding 4: \u201cREPORTED_STRAINED_AND_DETERIORATED_FOR \u2192 Agriculture\u201d).  \n- The findings do not specify direct positive effects from lower rates on agriculture in any district, only the deterioration in St. Louis.\n\n**Pattern:** In at least one district (St. Louis), agriculture did not benefit from lower rates; conditions worsened even as district\u2011wide credit remained strong.\n\n---\n\n**6. Cross\u2011district pattern of transmission**\n\n- Monetary policy transmission shows \u201cdistrict\u2011level divergence\u201d in its effects on housing, autos, and capital investment (Finding 3: query on \u201cdistrict-level divergence monetary policy transmission housing autos capital investment\u201d).  \n- Across the entire set of findings, contacts repeatedly report that:\n  - Lower interest rates were a recognized driver of increased demand (financial services, commercial construction, some consumer spending and autos).  \n  - Yet several interest\u2011rate\u2011sensitive sectors (housing in multiple districts, business investment in the Chicago and First Districts, agriculture in St. Louis, CRE activity in Kansas City) remained weak, declined, or only showed muted responses.  \n\n**Overall answer:**  \nLower interest rates did transmit into increased demand and improved credit conditions in some interest\u2011sensitive sectors and districts\u2014especially in parts of commercial construction, some real estate lending in Dallas, and auto sales in districts with strong EV demand. However, housing activity often remained muted despite lower rates, business investment was flat or slightly down in several districts, agriculture deteriorated in at least the St. Louis District, and commercial real estate activity declined in Kansas City even as credit conditions stayed stable. These patterns indicate that the impact of lower interest rates on interest\u2011sensitive sectors was heterogeneous across districts, with significant regional divergence in the strength and nature of the response.",

The agent correctly conveys the general theme that lower rates boosted some commercial/financial activity while housing was muted/uneven, and it mentions commercial construction and financial services benefiting from lower rates. However, it fails to identify Cleveland\u2019s effects, does not clearly state Chicago\u2019s increased business loan volumes/looser conditions, and contradicts the expected Dallas point by claiming Dallas residential real estate credit improved rather than residential real estate remaining weak. It also omits the specific Boston point about flat home sales. Extra material (autos, agriculture, other districts) does not compensate for the missing/incorrect key district specifics.",

      "expected": "Federal funding changes negatively impacted employment across multiple sectors: In Boston, cuts to federal grant funding contributed to layoffs in education and health-care sectors. In Cleveland, the nonprofit sector was not filling open positions due to federal grant uncertainty. In New York, nonprofits faced challenges from reduced federal benefit programs, with community health-care centers reporting financial strain. Manufacturing employment in Boston was mixed, with one firm shedding workers to offset tariff-related cost increases.",
      "answer": "Federal funding changes affected employment in the following ways, by direction of funding change and by broad sector, based strictly on the findings you provided.\n\n---\n\n### 1. When federal funding increased\n\nAcross the evidence, increases in federal funding (including stimulus, infrastructure, defense, healthcare, education, and COVID\u2011related relief) are associated with **stronger labor market outcomes**:\n\n- **General pattern across sectors**  \n  - Increases in funding, especially via stimulus and relief programs, are consistently linked to:\n    - Higher **employment**\n    - **Wage growth**\n    - A stronger **labor market** and greater **economic activity**  \n  - At the same time, the evidence also notes the co\u2011existence of **unemployment** and **workforce reduction**, implying that gains are uneven and context\u2011dependent rather than uniformly positive across all workers or sub\u2011industries.  \n  *(Finding 1: references to \u201cstimulus spending employment effects,\u201d \u201cCOVID relief employment effects by sector,\u201d and \u201cstimulus spending employment by industry\u201d)*\n\n- **Healthcare sector**  \n  - Increases in **healthcare funding** are directly associated with:\n    - **Employment growth**\n    - A stronger **labor market**\n    - **Wage growth** in health\u2011related services  \n  - Mentions of **unemployment** and **workforce reduction** also appear in this context, indicating that while healthcare funding supports employment overall, there can be localized or program\u2011specific job losses.  \n  *(Finding 1: \u201chealthcare funding jobs\u201d)*\n\n- **Infrastructure and construction\u2011related activity**  \n  - **Infrastructure spending** is tied to:\n    - Increased **economic activity**\n    - **Wage growth**  \n  - While the findings do not explicitly quantify construction jobs, these indicators are treated as precursors or correlates of higher employment in infrastructure\u2011related sectors.  \n  *(Finding 1: \u201cinfrastructure spending\u201d)*\n\n- **Defense sector and related industries**  \n  - **Defense spending** and **defense budget** increases are strongly connected with:\n    - Higher **employment**\n    - Stronger **labor market** conditions\n    - **Wage growth**  \n  - At the same time, topics like **unemployment** and **workforce reduction** appear alongside defense spending, indicating that changes in defense allocations can also involve layoffs or restructuring in some defense\u2011related activities.  \n  *(Finding 1: \u201cdefense spending employment impact,\u201d \u201cdefense budget employment\u201d)*\n\n- **Education sector**  \n  - **Education funding** is linked to:\n    - **Employment**\n    - **Wage growth**\n    - Overall **labor market** strength  \n  - Unemployment is also mentioned, suggesting that while education funding supports jobs, there may still be areas of contraction or delayed hiring.  \n  *(Finding 1: \u201ceducation funding employment\u201d)*\n\n- **Services and manufacturing under stimulus/COVID relief**  \n  - In the context of **stimulus spending by industry** and **COVID relief by sector**, the **Services Industry** and **Manufacturing** appear as affected sectors:\n    - Funding and relief measures are associated with:\n      - Higher **employment**\n      - **Wage growth**\n      - Stronger **labor market** and **economic activity**  \n    - Yet, **workforce reduction** and **unemployment** also appear, indicating that even with support, some firms or subsectors reduced staff.  \n  *(Finding 1: \u201cstimulus spending employment by industry,\u201d \u201cCOVID relief employment effects by sector\u201d)*\n\n- **Time\u2011series / NAICS\u2011based evidence (aggregate sector detail)**  \n  - Analysis linking **federal outlays by function** to **NAICS sector employment** indicates a **measurable relationship** between fiscal policy and employment at a **sectoral (NAICS) level**, though:\n    - The relationship is characterized as **complex**, not a simple one\u2011to\u2011one mapping.\n    - It reinforces that changes in federal spending classifications (functions) can be detected in employment data by NAICS sector.  \n  *(Finding 4: \u201cfederal outlays by function,\u201d \u201cNAICS sector employment,\u201d \u201cfiscal policy impact on employment by industry\u201d)*\n\n---\n\n### 2. When federal funding was cut or austerity measures were applied\n\nWhen federal funding was **reduced** or austerity policies were implemented, the direction of effects on employment reverses:\n\n- **General pattern across sectors**  \n  - Funding cuts and austerity are **strongly associated** with:\n    - **Workforce reduction**\n    - Higher **unemployment**\n    - Weaker **labor market** conditions  \n  *(Finding 2: \u201cfederal funding cuts employment by industry,\u201d \u201causterity public sector layoffs\u201d)*\n\n- **Services Industry (most clearly affected)**  \n  - The **Services Industry** appears prominently in the context of:\n    - **Federal funding cuts**\n    - **Workforce reduction**\n    - **Unemployment**  \n  - This indicates that services are particularly exposed when federal resources are withdrawn.  \n  *(Finding 2: \u201cServices Industry, Workforce Reduction, Unemployment\u201d)*\n  \n- **Manufacturing and resource\u2011intensive sectors**  \n  - The findings link funding cuts with:\n    - **Manufacturing**\n    - **Metals & Mining**\n    - **Paper & Forest Products**  \n  - In these sectors, cuts are associated with:\n    - **Workforce reduction**\n    - **Unemployment**\n    - Stress in the broader **labor market**  \n  *(Finding 2: \u201cfederal funding cuts employment by industry\u201d topics)*\n\n- **Public sector and austerity**  \n  - In the context of **austerity** and **public sector layoffs**, evidence highlights:\n    - **Workforce reduction**\n    - Increased **unemployment**\n    - Tighter labor conditions during **recession** episodes and periods of **economic uncertainty**  \n  *(Finding 2: \u201causterity public sector layoffs\u201d)*\n\n---\n\n### 3. Causality and limitations\n\n- The evidence indicates that **federal funding increases** are **positively associated** with stronger employment outcomes (and wage growth) across multiple sectors, while **funding cuts and austerity** are **positively associated** with workforce reductions and higher unemployment, especially in the Services Industry and several goods\u2011producing sectors. *(Findings 1 and 2)*  \n- A time\u2011series perspective using **federal outlays by function** and **NAICS sector employment** confirms that **fiscal policy shifts have detectable sectoral employment impacts**, but the relationship is described as **complex** rather than purely causal or uniform. *(Finding 4)*  \n- The findings do **not** provide concrete, program\u2011level case studies or quantify job gains/losses by specific named federal programs. *(Finding 3)*\n\n---\n\n**Direct answer to the original question:**  \nBased on the assembled findings, **increases** in federal funding\u2014through stimulus, infrastructure, defense, healthcare, education, and COVID\u2011era relief\u2014are consistently linked to **higher employment, wage growth, and stronger labor market conditions** across sectors such as healthcare, defense\u2011related industries, education, services, manufacturing, and others classified by NAICS, though with localized instances of workforce reduction. In contrast, **federal funding cuts and austerity measures** are strongly associated with **workforce reductions and higher unemployment**, particularly in the **Services Industry**, **Manufacturing**, **Metals & Mining**, and **Paper & Forest Products**, indicating that changes in federal funding materially affect employment outcomes in these specific sectors.",

The agent instead gives a generic discussion of funding increases/cuts across broad sectors, does not mention Boston/Cleveland/New York, nonprofits, grant uncertainty, or the tariff-related manufacturing detail, and introduces unsupported claims about funding increases and defense/infrastructure effects.

      "answer": "Based on the available findings, the research does not identify district\u2011specific factors; it only provides national\u2011level drivers of uncertainty for the U.S. economy over the last 12\u201324 months.\n\nFrom Finding 3 (U.S. macro context):\n\n- **Inflation:** Economic uncertainty was cited as contributing to inflation, and inflation itself was a primary factor driving uncertainty about the economic outlook, prices, and costs. [Finding 3]  \n- **Interest rates and loan demand:** Interest rates, as a policy tool, directly influenced loan demand, which \u201cwas keeping weak\u201d or \u201ckept weak\u201d; bankers and borrowers \u201cremained cautious\u201d amid this environment. Weak and cautious loan demand was closely linked to economic uncertainty and was expected to weigh on overall economic activity.

Labor shortages due to immigration policy changes also constrained production in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture sectors.",
      "answer": "Available findings identify only a few specific disruptions and impacts, and in some areas the evidence is missing.\n\n1. **Semiconductor and critical component shortages**\n\n   - **Nature of disruption:** The findings indicate shortages in \u201cSemiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment\u201d and related critical components, treated as a supply chain issue linked to manufacturing and imports/exports. These shortages are associated with broader supply chain conditions that \u201cDECLINED_RELATIVE_TO \u2192 Manufacturing,\u201d and with supply chains that were \u201cREPORTED_AS_ADEQUATE_BUT_AT_HIGHER_COSTS\u201d and \u201cWAS_ACCOMPANIED_BY_HIGHER \u2192 Cost Structure.\u201d [Finding 2]\n\n   - **Impact on manufacturing production:**  \n     - The shortages are described as having a \u201csignificant negative impact on manufacturing output, leading to reduced production and potentially higher costs.\u201d [Finding 2]  \n     - More generally, supply chains for manufacturers are characterized as having \u201cDECLINED_RELATIVE_TO \u2192 Manufacturing,\u201d while remaining \u201cADEQUATE \u2026 BUT AT HIGHER COSTS\u201d according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

Finding 3 explicitly states that \u201cThere is no quantifiable impact of supply chain disruptions on manufacturing production indices that can be determined from the provided evidence.\u201d [Finding 3]\n\n2. **Broader supply chain disruptions and firm\u2011level production responses**\n\n   - **Nature of disruptions (as inferred from firm behavior):**  \n     - Manufacturing contacts faced shipping and logistics cost pressures, import constraints, and tariff\u2011related cost issues: supply chains \u201cWAS_CONSTRAINED_BY \u2192 Imports,\u201d and firms \u201cNEGOTIATED_PRICING_WITH_INFLUENCED_BY_TARIFFS\u201d and \u201cRAISED [prices] WHILE_CITING_TARIFFS_AS_JUSTIFICATION.\u201d [Finding 4]  \n     - These conditions are part of the broader \u201cSupply Chain\u201d topic that \u201cDECLINED_RELATIVE_TO \u2192 Manufacturing\u201d and \u201cSOFTENED_IN \u2192 Supply Chain.\u201d [Finding 4]\n\n   - **Impact on production and production patterns:**  \n     - **Decline in activity:** The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that \u201cManufacturing activity has declined slightly since our previous report,\u201d with one Tennessee manufacturer noting a downturn in new business inquiries and an equipment manufacturer in Kentucky reporting decreased sales relative to the start of the year. [Finding 4] The findings link this context to supply chain and cost challenges, but do not quantify the share of the decline directly attributable to supply chain disruptions versus other factors.\n     - **Facility and location decisions affecting production structure:**  \n       - \u201cSome firms reported that they were building multiple facilities across the region to offset shipping and logistics costs.\u201d [Finding 4] This indicates a reconfiguration of production capacity and geography in response to supply chain and logistics disruptions.  \n       - An apparel company \u201creported offshoring manufacturing to the Caribbean due to labor challenges,\u201d and other firms explored shipping \u201cunfinished goods to the U.S. for final assembly\u201d as a cost\u2011effective strategy to manage tariffs, shipping, and labor. [Finding 4] These responses altered where and how production stages occurred, rather than the findings giving explicit output volumes.\n     - **Cost and pricing effects on production:**  \n       - Some manufacturing firms \u201cfully passed higher import costs along to\u201d customers, while at least one firm \u201cshed workers to offset tariff related\u201d cost structure pressures. [Finding 4] This suggests that supply\u2011chain\u2011related cost shocks (imports, tariffs) affected production inputs (labor) and pricing, though the precise impact on output levels is not quantified in the findings.\n     - **Inventory and availability:**  \n       - Supply chain disruptions led some firms to increase inventories (\u201cINCREASED \u2192 Inventory\u201d), and supply chains for manufacturers were \u201cREPORTED_AS_ADEQUATE_BUT_AT_HIGHER_COSTS.\u201d [Finding 4] This implies that while direct material shortages may have eased to \u201cadequate\u201d levels for many manufacturers, the cost side of production remained elevated.\n\n3. **Quantitative impact on production indices**\n\n   - The research explicitly reports that \u201cThere is no quantifiable impact of supply chain disruptions on manufacturing production indices that can be determined from the provided evidence.\u201d [Finding 3]  \n   - Therefore, while the findings describe declines in manufacturing activity at some firms and qualitatively negative effects (reduced production, higher costs), they do not provide numerical estimates (e.g., percent changes in industrial production) for the impact of supply chain disruptions.\n\n**Summary based on available evidence**\n\n- Identified disruptions include semiconductor and critical component shortages and broader supply\u2011chain constraints tied to imports, tariffs, and shipping/logistics costs. [Findings 2 and 4]  \n- These disruptions are reported to have:  \n  - Reduced manufacturing output and led to higher production costs in sectors dependent on these components. [Finding 2]  \n  - Contributed to slight declines in manufacturing activity at some firms, changes in facility location and production staging (offshoring, multi\u2011facility strategies, unfinished\u2011goods shipping), and labor adjustments (including worker shedding) to cope with tariff\u2011 and import\u2011related cost increases.

The agent instead gives generalized cross-district statements (business demand softened, consumer held up via credit cards/autos), claims limited district detail, and does not report the required district-specific facts.

      "expected": "In Dallas, price pressures were subdued in services but remained elevated in the manufacturing sector. In Richmond, price growth remained moderate overall despite some pickup in price growth in the manufacturing sector. In Chicago, producer prices grew moderately with contacts reporting moderate nonlabor cost increases including energy and raw materials. Manufacturing contacts attributed some raw materials price increases to tariffs, suggesting tariffs disproportionately affected goods-producing sectors.",
      "answer": "Based on the findings provided, price pressures differed between manufacturing and services in three main ways: level, drivers, and recent trajectory.\n\n1. **Relative level of price pressures**\n   * Manufacturing: Firms in the manufacturing sector \u201cexperienced input prices growing at a strong pace,\u201d with inflation in this sector described as \u201celevated\u201d and \u201cgrowing at a strong pace\u201d for input costs. Energy prices were \u201creported rising by manufacturers\u201d and were \u201ca particularly important input category\u201d contributing to higher costs, while commodities costs, though \u201cmoderating,\u201d still added to elevated input costs. Post\u2011COVID supply chain conditions were \u201cadequate but at higher costs,\u201d which also raised manufacturers\u2019 cost structures.\n   * Services: In contrast, \u201cprice pressures in services\u2026were subdued,\u201d with inflation \u201csubdued in the services sector\u201d over the reporting period. Input prices for services firms \u201cgrew more moderately\u2026compared with manufacturing firms\u201d and \u201cexperienced input prices growing at a more moderate\u201d pace.\n\n   **Implication from findings:** Price pressures were higher and more pronounced in manufacturing, while they were relatively subdued and more moderate in services.\n\n2. **Main sources of pressure**\n   * Manufacturing: The findings attribute manufacturing price pressures primarily to:\n     * Strong increases in **input costs**, especially:\n       * **Energy prices**, which \u201cincreased\u201d and were \u201craising\u201d cost structures and contributing to inflation.\n       * **Commodities**, which were \u201chighlighted\u201d as higher-cost by manufacturing contacts and described by one manufacturing firm as moving \u201cfrom a boil to a simmer,\u201d indicating still\u2011elevated but easing commodity pressures.\n     * **Supply chain**: Post\u2011COVID supply chain conditions \u201cwere adequate but at higher costs,\u201d so even as logistical bottlenecks improved, they did so alongside higher cost structures for manufacturers.\n     * These elevated inputs affected \u201cprices received\u201d and led manufacturers to \u201cexpect selling price growth to accelerate,\u201d indicating an intention or need to pass higher costs through to output prices.\n   * Services: For services, the findings do not provide the same detailed breakdown of drivers (e.g., specific mention of energy or commodities is not tied directly to services in the evidence). What is specified is that:\n     * Input prices at services firms were \u201cgrowing at a more moderate\u201d pace.\n     * Overall service\u2011sector price pressures were repeatedly described as \u201csubdued.\u201d\n\n   **Implication from findings:** Manufacturing price pressures were driven by elevated and broad\u2011based input cost increases (energy, commodities, higher supply\u2011chain costs), whereas the services sector faced more moderate input cost increases and correspondingly subdued price pressures. The findings do not specify particular cost categories (such as labor) as drivers for services.\n\n3. **Recent trajectory and expectations**\n   * Manufacturing:\n     * Some \u201cdisinflation in goods\u201d was observed, indicating that inflation for manufactured goods had started to decline.\n     * Despite this, manufacturers still \u201cexpect selling price growth to accelerate to a strong pace,\u201d suggesting that, from their perspective, price pressures and pricing intentions remain elevated even as some disinflation appears in the data.\n   * Services:\n     * Price pressures were \u201csubdued\u201d during the reporting period.\n     * Nonetheless, firms in the services sector \u201cexpected [price pressures] to accelerate over the next 12 months,\u201d with service firms expecting inflation to pick up from its currently subdued level.\n\n   **Implication from findings:** At the time of reporting, manufacturing was experiencing higher and more immediate price pressures than services, but both sectors anticipated some acceleration in selling prices going forward\u2014manufacturing from an already elevated base, services from a subdued base.\n\n**Overall comparison based strictly on the findings:**\n\n- **Magnitude now:** Manufacturing faces stronger price pressures than services, with manufacturers reporting strongly rising input costs (especially energy and commodities) and higher cost structures, while services price pressures are described as subdued and more moderate.\n- **Nature of pressures:** Manufacturing pressures are clearly linked to higher input costs and costlier (though improved) supply chains. For services, the findings only state that input costs are rising more moderately and that overall inflation is subdued, without detailing specific cost drivers.\n- **Direction of change:** Both sectors expect some acceleration in selling price growth, but from different starting points: elevated in manufacturing, subdued in services.",

      "expected": "Employers showed cautious hiring behavior: More employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition. Those still hiring favored temporary and part-time workers over full-time employment. In Boston, both hiring and layoffs increased modestly, indicating churn rather than net growth. Employment in IT services increased modestly with hiring in sales and technical positions - a relative bright spot. Jobseekers in Cleveland reported offers were more likely to be part-time with little or no benefits. This pattern indicates employer uncertainty and reluctance to commit to permanent workforce expansion.",
      "answer": "Hiring patterns shifted from broad workforce expansion toward more cautious, replacement-only hiring, with sector-specific differences, and this points to employers being cautiously confident but not uniformly optimistic.\n\n1. **How hiring patterns changed**\n\n- The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco reported that **employment levels were little changed on net over the reporting period**, and **\u201cmost employers hired only to replace workers, holding head counts steady.\u201d** This indicates a move away from active expansion toward maintaining existing staffing levels. (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Labor Markets)\n\n- In the same report, **several contacts in manufacturing and health care reduced staff levels** through **attrition, layoffs, and early retirements**, sometimes **coupled with investment in AI** for tasks usually done by less experienced employees. This reflects targeted workforce reduction and substitution of some labor with technology. (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Labor Markets)\n\n- By contrast, **employers in financial services and insurance continued to hire**, showing that hiring strength persisted in some sectors even as others cooled. (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Labor Markets)\n\n- Across this labor market context, **the number of applicants per open position increased, and employers generally found it easier to hire**, while **turnover continued to slow** and some contacts prioritized retaining experienced workers. This suggests a labor market that is **cooling and becoming less tight**, even as overall employment remains roughly stable. (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco > Labor Markets)\n\n- More broadly, the labor market was described as **\u201cslowing but still relatively robust,\u201d** with **persistent tightness in some sectors and gradual cooling in others**, alongside **moderating wage growth** and **fluctuating but still relatively low unemployment**, and some **workforce reductions** in specific contexts. (Finding 1 summary based on labor market, wage growth, unemployment, workforce reduction, and economic outlook topics)\n\n2. **What this indicates about employer confidence**\n\n- These hiring behaviors\u2014**limiting hiring to replacements, holding head counts steady, and being cautious with expansions**\u2014are identified as reflecting **cautious employer confidence or uncertainty**, as opposed to strong, broad-based optimism. The research links **\u201climited hiring to replacement of workers\u201d** and firms that **\u201cremained cautious with hiring\u201d** directly to more guarded business sentiment. (Finding 3; Employment and Labor Market topic edges)\n\n- At the same time, there is evidence of **generally optimistic but cautious business sentiment**:\n  - Business confidence **improved in some Federal Reserve districts** and was **reported as brightened somewhat overall** by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. (Business Confidence topic edges; Federal Reserve Bank of Boston)\n  - In the Boston Fed\u2019s software and IT services contacts, **demand remained strong, revenues rose, profit margins improved, and firms were \u201cquite optimistic, expecting further healthy revenue growth in the coming months.\u201d** (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston > Software and IT Services)\n  - Across contacts, **employment is expected to be higher in the future** and businesses **expect employment levels to be higher than in previous periods**, indicating forward-looking confidence about eventual workforce growth, even if current hiring is subdued. (Employment topic edges: \u201cEXPECT_TO_BE_HIGHER_THAN_IN_2025_FOR,\u201d \u201cEXPECT_INCREASE_IN\u201d)\n\n- However, the findings also note that **near-term hiring remains limited partly because of economic uncertainty and cost structure concerns**, meaning that even optimistic employers are **holding back on aggressive hiring**. (Finding 2 summary on employment and business confidence)\n\n**Synthesis**\n\n- **Change in hiring patterns:** Employers have shifted from strong, expansionary hiring toward **replacement-focused, steady head counts**, with **selective staff reductions in some sectors** and **continued expansion in others (e.g., financial services, insurance, software/IT).** The labor market remains relatively robust but is **gradually cooling**, with more applicants per job, easier hiring conditions for employers, and slower turnover.\n\n- **Implication for employer confidence:** This pattern indicates **cautious or guarded confidence**. Employers show **optimism about future activity and revenue\u2014especially in sectors like software and IT services\u2014and expect higher employment over time**, but **current hiring is constrained**, with many firms **only replacing departures and deferring larger expansions due to economic uncertainty and cost pressures.**",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",

However, it misses several key required specifics: the shift toward temporary/part-time hiring, the Boston \u201cboth hiring and layoffs up\u201d churn point, and the Cleveland part-time/no-benefits detail.
