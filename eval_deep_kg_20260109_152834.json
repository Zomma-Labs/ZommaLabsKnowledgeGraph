      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "answer": "Economic activity in the Twelfth District (San Francisco) **edged down slightly** during the most recent Beige Book reporting period (mid\u2011August to September), according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\u2019s Summary of Economic Activity and the national Beige Book highlights for the San Francisco District [2026-01-09].\n\nKey reported changes:\n\n- **Overall activity:**  \n  - \u201cEconomic activity in the Twelfth District edged down slightly during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period\u201d [FRB San Francisco, Summary of Economic Activity, 2026-01-09].  \n  - The national Beige Book likewise notes that \u201ceconomic activity edged down slightly during the referenced period\u201d in the San Francisco District [National Summary, San Francisco, 2026-01-09].\n\n- **Labor market and wages:**  \n  - \u201cEmployment levels in the Twelfth District were little changed on net during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period\u201d [FRB San Francisco, Summary of Economic Activity, 2026-01-09].  \n  - \u201cEmployment levels were little changed during the referenced period\u201d in the San Francisco District [National Summary, San Francisco, 2026-01-09].  \n  - \u201cWages in the Twelfth District grew slightly during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period\u201d [FRB San Francisco, Summary of Economic Activity, 2026-01-09];

the national summary also notes that \u201cconditions in business services were mixed\u201d and \u201cconditions in consumer services were mixed\u201d in the San Francisco District [National Summary, San Francisco, 2026-01-09].  \n  - Within this, \u201cdemand for business technology services grew more noticeably within the consumer and business services sector\u201d [FRB San Francisco, Retail Trade and Services, 2026-01-09].  \n  - Separately, \u201cactivity in retail trade decreased somewhat during the referenced period\u201d in the San Francisco District [National Summary, San Francisco, 2026-01-09].\n\n- **Real estate and construction:**  \n  - \u201cActivity in residential real estate in the Twelfth District decreased somewhat during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period\u201d [FRB San Francisco, Summary of Economic Activity, 2026-01-09];

the national highlights similarly report that \u201clending activity remained stable\u201d in the San Francisco District [National Summary, San Francisco, 2026-01-09].  \n  - Within banking, \u201cdemand for commercial loans remained generally muted in the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco district during the reporting period\u201d [FRB San Francisco, Financial Institutions, 2026-01-09].\n\nIn sum, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco reports that **overall economic activity in the Twelfth District declined slightly**, with **flat employment, slight wage and modest price increases, mixed service-sector conditions (including stronger business technology services but weaker retail trade), declining residential real estate and agriculture, unchanged commercial real estate, and stable but muted lending activity** during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period [FRB San Francisco & National Summary, 2026-01-09].",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says Twelfth District activity edged down slightly, with retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate decreasing or stable. The agent states overall activity edged down slightly and specifically notes retail trade decreased, agriculture weakened/decreased, and residential real estate decreased. This matches the key facts (and adds extra details without contradicting them).",

      "question": "What is the Beige Book?",
      "expected": "The Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication about current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It characterizes regional economic conditions and prospects based on a variety of mostly qualitative information, gathered directly from each District's sources.",
      "answer": "The research findings do not provide any specific information about the Beige Book itself\u2014such as who publishes it, what it contains, how often it is released, or its purpose. They only outline what kind of information would be needed (definition, publisher, content, purpose, schedule, etc.) but do not supply those details.\n\nBecause of that, based strictly on the findings provided, what the Beige Book is cannot be determined.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer defines the Beige Book as a Federal Reserve System publication summarizing current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts using mostly qualitative information. The agent\u2019s answer instead claims it cannot be determined and provides no definition, contradicting the expected answer.",

      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer is 12 Federal Reserve Districts, and the agent explicitly states the Beige Book covers all 12 Federal Reserve Districts. This matches the expected answer.",

      "question": "How did overall economic activity change according to the October 2025 Beige Book?",
      "expected": "Economic activity changed little on balance since the previous report, with three Districts reporting slight to modest growth in activity, five reporting no change, and four noting a slight softening.",
      "answer": "According to the October 2025 Beige Book\u2019s national summary, overall economic activity showed a **mixed** change across Federal Reserve Districts:\n\n- **Four Districts** reported a **slight softening in activity** since the previous report.  \n- **Three Districts** reported **slight to modest growth** in activity over the same period.  \n- The New York and Minneapolis Districts described **slight declines** in overall economic activity, while the Boston District reported that economic activity **\u201cticked up\u201d overall.**  \n- The Kansas City District reported that economic activity **fell slightly**, even as contacts there expressed **broadly optimistic expectations** for sales and employment in 2026, and manufacturing contacts expected more favorable conditions in 2026 than in 2025.  \n- At the national level, **many contacts continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down economic activity.**\n\nTaken together, the Beige Book characterized overall economic activity in October 2025 as **neither uniformly expanding nor contracting**, but rather **mixed**, with small declines or softening in several Districts, slight to modest growth in others, and ongoing uncertainty acting as a drag on activity.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says activity changed little on balance, with three Districts reporting slight to modest growth, five reporting no change, and four noting slight softening. The agent correctly includes three Districts with slight to modest growth and four with slight softening, but it omits/misstates the key point that five Districts reported no change. It also adds extra district-specific claims not required by the question and does not clearly state \u201cchanged little on balance.\u201d",

      "question": "Which districts reported slight to modest economic growth?",
      "expected": "Three districts reported slight to modest growth: Boston (First District), Philadelphia (Third District), and Richmond (Fifth District).",
      "answer": "The latest Beige Book national summary states that:\n\n- \u201cThree Districts reported slight to modest growth in activity since the previous report.\u201d  \n  [2026-01-09 | National Summary > Overall Economic Activity]\n\nHowever, the findings do **not** specify which individual Federal Reserve districts those three are by name. The only district-level examples given are:\n\n- Boston: \u201ceconomic activity expanded slightly\u201d  \n  [2026-01-09 | National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Boston]\n\n- Philadelphia: \u201cBusiness activity in the Philadelphia District increased slightly\u201d  \n  [2026-01-09 | National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Philadelphia]\n\nThese descriptions are consistent with \u201cslight\u201d growth, but the national summary does not explicitly identify whether Boston and Philadelphia are among the three districts counted as having \u201cslight to modest growth,\u201d nor does it list the third district.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided findings:\n\n- **Number of districts** with \u201cslight to modest growth\u201d: **three**  \n- **Specific district names**: **not identified in the findings; the research does not specify which three districts these are.**",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer names the three districts: Boston (First), Philadelphia (Third), and Richmond (Fifth). The agent only identifies Boston and Philadelphia as examples and explicitly claims the findings do not specify which three districts they are, omitting Richmond and denying the specificity. Therefore it does not contain all key facts and contradicts the expected answer.",
