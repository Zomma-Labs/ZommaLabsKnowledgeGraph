      "question": "How did economic activity change in the Twelfth District (San Francisco)?",
      "expected": "In San Francisco, economic activity edged down slightly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate either decreased or remained stable.",
      "answer": "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\u2019s most recent Summary of Economic Activity for the Twelfth District (covering roughly mid\u2011August to September 2025), economic activity **edged down slightly** over the period.\n\nSpecific reported changes were:\n\n- **Overall activity:** The San Francisco Fed states that overall economic activity in the Twelfth District **\u201cedged down slightly\u201d** during the mid\u2011August to September reporting period.  \n- **Sectoral conditions:**  \n  - Consumer and business services were reported as **mixed**.  \n  - **Resource\u2011related sectors** and **agriculture** **weakened slightly**.  \n  - **Community support organizations** **weakened modestly**.  \n  - **Manufacturing** activity **remained largely stable**.  \n  - **Commercial real estate** activity was **unchanged on balance**.  \n- **Labor market and wages:**  \n  - **Employment levels were little changed on net**, with most employers **holding headcounts steady**.  \n  - **Wages grew slightly** in the District over the same period.  \n- **Prices and credit conditions:**  \n  - **Prices rose modestly**.  \n  - **Lending activity remained largely stable**, with lending in the San Francisco District described as **stable** in the national summary.  \n- **Outlook:**  \n  - The San Francisco Fed reports that **contacts\u2019 economic outlook weakened somewhat** relative to the prior reporting period.\n\nTaken together, the San Francisco Fed\u2019s reporting indicates that, in the latest period, the Twelfth District shifted from a more stable stance to **slightly softer overall economic activity**, with stability in manufacturing, employment, commercial real estate, and lending, but mild weakening in resource\u2011related sectors, agriculture, and community organizations, and a somewhat more pessimistic outlook among contacts.",
      "verdict": "partially_correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer says Twelfth District (San Francisco) economic activity edged down slightly, with retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate decreasing or stable. The agent correctly states overall activity edged down slightly and notes agriculture weakened slightly. However, it does not mention retail trade or residential real estate as expected, and instead discusses other sectors (services, manufacturing, commercial real estate, lending) that are not part of the key expected points. Therefore it contains some but not all key facts.",

      "expected": "The Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication about current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It characterizes regional economic conditions and prospects based on a variety of mostly qualitative information, gathered directly from each District's sources.",
      "answer": "The Beige Book is a Federal Reserve System publication about current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts, officially titled a \u201cSummary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions\u201d [2025-10-15 | About This Publication > What is the Beige Book?].\n\nIts main features, based on the findings, are:\n\n- **Purpose and role:**  \n  - It provides a *regular summary* of information on current economic conditions for the public [2025-10-15 | About This Publication > How is the information collected?].  \n  - It is intended to **characterize the change in economic conditions since the last report** [2025-10-15 | About This Publication > What is the purpose of the Beige Book?].  \n  - Federal Reserve staff and economists use data and analysis *supplemented by information from contacts* and from the Beige Book to **assess economic conditions in the Federal Reserve Districts** [2025-10-15 | About This Publication > How is the information used?].  \n  - Information from contacts and the Beige Book **enables comparison of economic conditions in different parts of the country** [2025-10-15 | About This Publication > How is the information used?].\n\n- **Content and information sources:**  \n  - It **reports on current economic conditions** and **characterizes regional economic conditions and prospects** across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts [2025-10-15 | About This Publication > What is the Beige Book?].  \n  - It is based on **mostly qualitative information** gathered directly from each District\u2019s sources [2025-10-15 | About This Publication > What is the Beige Book?].  \n  - Information is collected from a **wide range of contacts** using a **variety of formal and informal methods**, including interviews with market experts and other stakeholders [2025-10-15 | About This Publication > What is the purpose of the Beige Book?; About This Publication > How is the information collected?].\n\n- **Publication and use:**  \n  - The Beige Book is **published eight times per year** [2025-10-15 | About This Publication > What is the Beige Book?].  \n  - Each Federal Reserve Bank gathers information on current economic conditions in its District to contribute to the report [2025-10-15 | About This Publication > How is the information collected?].  \n  - Outreach for the Beige Book is described as one of the ways the Federal Reserve System **engages with external stakeholders about economic developments in their communities** [2025-10-15 | About This Publication > What is the purpose of the Beige Book?].",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer defines the Beige Book as a Federal Reserve System publication describing current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts, characterizing regional conditions and prospects using mostly qualitative information gathered from each District\u2019s sources. The agent\u2019s answer includes all these key points (Fed publication, 12 Districts, current conditions, regional conditions/prospects, mostly qualitative info from District sources). Additional details (official title, frequency, uses) do not contradict the expected answer.",

      "answer": "The research you provided contains no information from the October 2025 Beige Book itself, and no external findings were supplied.\n\nBecause of this, the findings do not specify how overall economic activity changed according to the October 2025 Beige Book, and I cannot state whether it was described as expanding, contracting, or stable, nor the pace or drivers of any change.",
      "verdict": "incorrect",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer states that overall economic activity changed little on balance, with specific counts of Districts reporting growth, no change, and slight softening. The agent instead claims there is no information and cannot describe the change. This fails to provide the correct content.",

      "question": "Which districts reported slight to modest economic growth?",
      "expected": "Three districts reported slight to modest growth: Boston (First District), Philadelphia (Third District), and Richmond (Fifth District).",
      "answer": "Based on the most recent Beige Book findings dated 2025\u201110\u201115, the districts that reported overall economic growth characterized as slight or modest are:\n\n- **Boston (First District)** \u2013 Overall economic activity \u201cexpanded slightly\u201d over the recent period. [2025-10-15 | National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Boston]\n\n- **Philadelphia (Third District)** \u2013 Economic activity \u201cincreased slightly\u201d in the current period, after having risen modestly in the prior period.

[2025-10-15 | Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond > Summary of Economic Activity]\n\nThe national summary notes that three districts reported \u201cslight to modest growth,\u201d and the evidence above identifies these three as Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond.",
      "verdict": "correct",
      "reasoning": "The expected answer lists Boston (First), Philadelphia (Third), and Richmond (Fifth) as the three districts reporting slight to modest growth. The agent\u2019s answer identifies exactly these three districts and explicitly ties them to slight/modest growth. No extra or missing districts are included.",
