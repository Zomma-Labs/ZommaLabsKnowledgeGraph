Instead, it hedges with a range and broader top 10/elite tier positioning, missing a direct match to the expected key facts.",

This is supported by knowledge graph data referencing sources like Bloomberg (e.g., an article dated July 22, 2022) and Wikipedia-style chunks stating: \"The firm completed a stock split in mid-2022.\" The split was a 20-for-1 adjustment, making shares more accessible to investors.",

      "agent_answer": "**Google remains the primary subsidiary under Alphabet Inc. (restructured in 2015 as the parent holding company), housing most core products and services that drive the majority of Alphabet's revenue (over 90% from advertising). Main direct components include:**\n\n- **Google Search**: The flagship search engine, organizing global information and powering ad revenue.\n- **YouTube**: Video sharing and streaming platform (explicitly linked as an integrated subsidiary of Google/Alphabet).\n- **Android** (OS and ecosystem): Mobile operating system (noted as integrated, despite minor graph naming variations).\n- **Google Cloud Platform**: Enterprise cloud computing and storage services.\n- **Gmail, Google Maps, Google Drive**: Core productivity and utility apps/services.\n- **Chrome** (browser and ecosystem): Web browser and related platforms.\n- **Advertising platforms** (e.g., Google Ads, AdSense): Monetization backbone.\n\n**Other Alphabet \"bets\" (e.g., Waymo for self-driving, Verily for life sciences, X lab) are separate subsidiaries, not direct Google components.** This structure is confirmed via Alphabet's entity relationships (Google as established/integrated subsidiary) and financial reports emphasizing Google's dominance. Recent data (e.g., 2023 10-K) highlights ongoing AI/cloud growth within Google.",
