Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months.

Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong.

Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months.

Corn and soybean fields were in good shape across most of the District. Dry conditions assisted harvest but hurt yields in some places; in addition, crop disease trimmed yields a bit. Fruit and vegetable production was subpar for most products. Soybean prices were lower, in part due to the absence of new-crop exports to China. Corn prices were down despite strong export volumes. Cattle and hog prices increased to record territory, while milk and egg prices declined. Concerns about higher input costs for 2026 intensified due to rising fertilizer prices. Farm operations, particularly crop producers, have already cut costs, with a contact saying, \"there is limited flexibility left to further reduce expenses.\" Contacts noted that lack of clarity on the economic outlook was putting a damper on capital investment, such as equipment purchases and repairs.",

Additionally, while some industries like financial services and insurance continue to hire, others, such as construction and manufacturing, face challenges due to reduced immigration (BeigeBook_20251015 | Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco).\n\nOverall, the muted demand for labor and the preference for temporary or part-time workers over full-time positions suggest that employers are wary of economic conditions and are prioritizing cost management and flexibility over expansion (BeigeBook_20251015 | National Summary).

              "content": "Employment levels in the District were generally flat over the reporting period. Several firms described what one dubbed a \"hiring chill,\" suggesting welcomed attrition and fewer head count additions in areas of growth. Turnover was low, with many describing the level as the lowest in their firm's history, and applicants for open positions were plentiful except for very specific, mostly technical, roles. Recently, however, head count reductions were cited more frequently, and some firms expect further cuts based on early Generative Al implementation results, particularly if demand slows further. Impacts from changes to immigration policy and enforcement were more material than previously reported but were concentrated in certain geographies like south Georgia and sectors such as agriculture and hospitality. Uncertainty around both labor supply and consumer demand continued to weigh on firms' hiring plans.",

Attrition remained exceptionally low, creating less need to hire for replacement. Labor demand varied by industry, with solid demand for workers in finance and accounting alongside still-soft demand for tech workers. Several businesses in construction and leisure and hospitality reported some difficulty finding workers due to shifts in immigration policy. A large retailer reported that instead of making workforce adjustments through hiring and firing, they were repositioning longer-tenured workers to increase productivity. While some firms were strategically downsizing, there remained no signs of major layoffs.",

          "expected": "Chicago District indicators: Economic activity was little changed (matching national 'little change on balance'). Consumer spending declined some (worse than national 'inched down'). Manufacturing demand declined modestly (consistent with national challenging conditions). Employment was flat (matching national stable levels). Wages and benefits costs were up modestly (matching national modest-to-moderate). Prices rose moderately (matching national rising trend). Financial conditions loosened slightly (better than mixed national picture). Construction/real estate increased slightly (better than mixed national). Farm income prospects unchanged. Compared to national trends, Chicago showed relative strength in financial conditions and construction while consumer spending and manufacturing weakness aligned with or slightly underperformed broader trends.",
          "predicted": "The key economic indicators for the Chicago (Seventh) District were as follows: economic activity was flat, consumer spending increased modestly, construction and real estate activity increased slightly, employment was flat, nonbusiness contacts saw no change in activity, business spending declined slightly, and manufacturing activity declined modestly. Prices rose moderately, wages were up modestly, and financial conditions loosened slightly. Prospects for 2025 farm income were unchanged. \n\nIn comparison to national trends, the national summary indicated that economic activity changed little on balance, with some districts reporting slight to modest growth, others no change, and some a slight softening. Overall consumer spending inched down, manufacturing activity varied by district, and conditions in agriculture, energy, and transportation were generally down. The outlook for future economic growth varied by district.\n\nSources:\n- [BeigeBook_20251015 | National Summary > Highlights by Federal Reserve District > Chicago]\n- [BeigeBook_20251015 | Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago > Summary of Economic Activity]",
